A Game Of Thrones Book One of A Song of Ice and Fire By George R. R. Martin PROLOGUE "We should start back," Gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around Gared.     He was an old man, past fifty, and He had seen the lordlings come and go.       "If he says they are dead, that's proof enough for he."   "My mother told me that dead men sing no songs," My mother put in.     "We have a long ride before We," Gared pointed out.      Will could see the tightness around Gared's mouth, the barely sup pressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the Night's Watch, man and boy, and Gared was not accustomed to being made light of.      The first time he had been sent beyond, all the old stories had come rushing back, and he bowels had turned to water.  He was a veteran of a hundred rangings by now, and the endless dark wilderness that the southron called the haunted forest had no more terrors for He.     Each day had been worse than the day that had come before Each day.  A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and A cold wind made the trees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something cold and implacable that loved him not.        Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch for less than half a year, but no one could say Ser Waymar had not prepared for Ser Waymar vocation.  His cloak was His crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. "Bet he killed them all he, he did," Gared told the barracks over wine, "twisted them little heads off, our mighty warrior."  It is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat shivering atop he garron.  "Mormont said as we should track them, and we did," Gared said.     If it snows, we could be a fortnight getting back, and snow's the best we can hope for.   He studied the deepening twilight in that half-bored, half-distracted  way He had. Will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt the knight when the knight looked like that.    Will had been a hunter before a hunter joined the Night's Watch.  Mallister freeriders had caught him red-handed in the Mallisters' own woods, skinning one of the Mallisters' own bucks, and it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand. No one could move through the woods as silent as Will, and No one had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent.      The snow's pretty well covered The snow now, but I could still make The snow out.           It was on the ground beside him, right by him hand."             Despite himself, himself shivered.     The young knight turned back to The young knight grizzled man-at-arms.    He adjusted the drape of He long sable cloak.     It burns, It does.   Then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up, and after a while you don't have the strength to fight it.        Gared pulled back Gared hood, giving Ser Waymar a good long look at the stumps where Gared ears had been.   We found my brother frozen at my brother watch, with a smile on my brother face."   Gared glared at the lordling, the scars around Gared ear holes flushed red with anger where Maester Aemon had cut the ears away.  He pulled up He hood and hunched over He garron, silent and sullen.           He saw it clear enough, now that the lordling had pointed it out.               Ser Waymar Royce came next, Ser Waymar Royce great black destrier snorting impatiently.   The old man-at-arms muttered to The old man-at-arms as The old man-at-arms rode.                 Royce paused a moment, staring off into the distance, Royce face reflective.                When Gared did not answer, Royce slid gracefully from Royce saddle. He tied the destrier securely to a low-hanging limb, well away from the other horses, and drew He longsword from his longsword sheath. Jewels glittered in Jewels hilt, and the moonlight ran down the shining steel. It was a splendid weapon, castle-forged, and new-made from the look of It.                   Gared's hood shadowed Gared's hood face, but Will could see the hard glitter in Gared's hood eyes as Gared's hood stared at the knight. For a moment he was afraid the older man would go for the older man sword. It was a short, ugly thing, It grip discolored by sweat, It edge nicked from hard use, but Will would not have given an iron bob for the lordling's life if Gared pulled It from It scabbard.  "No fire," he muttered, low under he breath. Royce took Royce for acquiescence and turned away.  Will threaded their way through a thicket, then started up the slope to the low ridge where he had found he vantage point under a sentinel tree.   Behind him, him heard the soft metallic slither of the lordling's ringmail, the rustle of leaves, and muttered curses as reaching branches grabbed at him longsword and tugged on him splendid sable cloak. The great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge, where Will had known it would be, Will lowest branches a bare foot off the ground.  His heart stopped in His chest.       he heard behind he.  He stood there beside the sentinel, longsword in hand, He cloak billowing behind He as the wind came up, outlined nobly against the stars for all to see.           A huge double-bladed battle-axe, still lying where A huge double-bladed battle-axe had seen A huge double-bladed battle-axe last, untouched.        Ser Waymar looked Ser Waymar over with open disapproval.            Soon his hands were sticky with sap, and his was lost among the needles. Fear filled his gut like a meal his could not digest. He whispered a prayer to the nameless gods of the wood, and slipped He dirk free of his dirk sheath. He put it between He teeth to keep both hands free for climbing. The taste of cold iron in his mouth gave his comfort.   He stopped climbing; He listened; He watched.     He turned He head, glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness.   Will opened his mouth to call down a warning, and the words seemed to freeze in his throat.       He was turning in a slow circle, suddenly wary, He sword in hand. He must have felt them, as Will felt them.       He could feel the sweet, sticky sap on He cheek.    Its armor seemed to change color as Its moved; here Its was white as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere dappled with the deep grey-green of the trees. The patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step The patterns took.    He threw the long sable cloak back over He shoulders, to free He arms for battle, and took He sword in both hands.       There was a faint blue shimmer to the thing, a ghost-light that played around its edges, and somehow Will knew its was sharper than any razor. Ser Waymar met Ser Waymar bravely.  He lifted He sword high over He head, defiant. His hands trembled from the weight of His hands, or perhaps from the cold.                Ser Waymar may have felt the cold that came with them, but Ser Waymar never saw them, never heard them.   And his death, if his did.   Ser Waymar met Ser Waymar with steel.    Behind him, to right, to left, all around him, the watchers stood patient, faceless, silent, the shifting patterns of the watchers delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood.  Again and again the swords met, until Will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished keening of the swords clash. Ser Waymar was panting from the effort now, Ser Waymar breath steaming in the moonlight.   The pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath The pale sword arm.    Ser  Waymar's fingers brushed Ser  Waymar's fingers side.  The Other said something in a language that Will did not know; The Other voice was like the cracking of ice on a winter lake, and the words were mocking. Ser Waymar Royce found Ser Waymar Royce fury.  he shouted, and he came up snarling, lifting the frost-covered longsword with both hands and swinging the frost-covered longsword around in a flat sidearm slash with all he weight behind the frost-covered longsword.    Royce went to Royce knees, shrieking, and covered Royce eyes. Blood welled between Blood fingers.    The pale blades sliced through ringmail as if The pale blades were silk.  Far beneath him, him heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles.   Finally, his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold, his climbed down.       The broken sword would be The broken sword proof. Gared would know what to make of Gared, and if not Gared, then surely that old bear Mormont or Maester Aemon.    Ser Waymar Royce stood over Ser Waymar Royce. His fine clothes were a tatter, His face a ruin. A shard from his sword transfixed the blind white pupil of his left eye.      Long, elegant hands brushed his cheek, then tightened around his throat.   They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among They, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with he lord father and he  brothers to see the king's justice done.   Robb thought Robb was a wildling, Robb sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the Kingbeyond-the-Wall. It made Bran's skin prickle to think of It.      He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and He dressed all in black, the same as a brother of the Night's Watch, except that He furs were ragged and greasy. The breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before man and horse. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on Robb and Jon horses, with Bran between Robb and Jon on Bran pony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that Bran'd seen all this before.   Bran's father sat solemnly on Bran's father horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making His look older than His thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to He grey eyes this day, and He seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest.   Finally the ragged man lord father gave a command, and two of his lord father guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square.  Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and Lord Eddard Stark ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword.     His father peeled off His gloves and handed his gloves to Jory Cassel, the captain of His household guard. He took hold of Ice with both hands and said, "In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of He Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, I do sentence you to die." He lifted the greatsword high above He head.     Bran kept Bran pony well in hand, and did not look away.    Bran could not take Bran eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank The snows around the stump eagerly, reddening as he watched.    He laughed, put He boot on the head, and kicked his boot away.  He put a hand on Bran's shoulder, and Bran looked over at He bastard brother. "You did well," Jon told Jon solemnly.   Bran rode with Bran brothers, well ahead of the main party, Bran pony struggling hard to keep up with his pony horses.  He was big and broad and growing every day, with He mother's coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun.      Jon's eyes were a grey so dark Jon's eyes seemed almost black, but there was little Jon's eyes did not see.  Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where Robb half brother was strong and fast.  "The Others take his eyes," his swore.   "Done," Jon said, kicking Jon horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as The hooves of their horses went.   He had seen the ragged man's eyes, and He was thinking of them now.  So deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until he father moved up to ride beside he.   "Yes, Father," Bran told Bran.  Wrapped in his furs and leathers, mounted on his great warhorse, his lord father loomed over his like a giant. "Robb says the man died bravely, but Jon says the man was afraid."   Bran thought about Bran. "Can a man still be brave if a man's afraid?" "That is the only time a man can be brave," a man father told a man.   "They carry off women and sell women to the Others."     The deserter knows The deserter life is forfeit if The deserter is taken, so The deserter will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile.  The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do The question."  "King Robert has a headsman," King Robert said, uncertainly. "He does," He father admitted.    If you would take a man's life, you owe you would take a man's life to a man to look into a man eyes and hear a man final words.  "One day, Bran, you will be Robb's bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to your brother and your king.           He sent He horse into a trot.  They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside Robb.  Robb stood knee-deep in white, Robb hood pulled back so the sun shone in Robb hair. He was cradling something in He arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited voices. The riders picked The riders way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven ground.  Greyjoy was laughing and joking as Greyjoy rode. Bran heard the breath go out of Bran.  he exclaimed, struggling to keep control of he horse as he reached for he sword.   he called as he horse reared under he. Robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in Robb arms.    He would have spurred the pony faster, but He father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot.     "A wolf," Robb told Robb.   Bran's heart was thumping in Bran chest as Bran pushed through a waist-high drift to Bran brothers' side.  Ice had formed in Ice shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to the faint smell of corruption like a woman's perfume.  But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father's kennel.      Bran tore Bran eyes away from the monster.   The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur, The pup eyes still closed. It nuzzled blindly against Robb's chest as Robb cradled It, searching for milk among Robb leathers, making a sad little whimpery sound.  "Go on," Robb told Robb.   His half brother put a second pup into His half brother arms.  Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup to Bran face.        Snow crunched under his boots as his moved around the body.  "There's something in the throat," Robb told Robb, proud to have found the answer before Robb father even asked. "There, just under the jaw.,, just under the jaw father knelt and groped under the beast's head with His father hand. He gave a yank and held a yank up for all to see.    Even Bran could sense Even Bran fear, though Even Bran did not understand. His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed His father hands in the snow.              He drew He sword.  The little thing squirmed against him, as if The little thing heard and understood.     For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father, like the lord he would someday be.    Bran looked to Bran lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow.    He could feel tears welling in He eyes, and He looked away. He did not want to cry in front of He father.  "Ser Rodrik's red bitch whelped again last week," Ser Rodrik's said.   "She'll rip them apart when them try to nurse."   Bran looked at Bran with desperate hope.        Bran saw Bran father's face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all He heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what Bran brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted Jon. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own own.       Robb rushed into the silence Robb left. "I will nurse him him, Father," him promised.    The lord weighed The lord sons long and carefully with The lord eyes.   If you want these pups, you will feed you want these pups yourselves.   The pup squirmed in The pup grasp, licked at The pup face with a warm tongue. "You must train them as well," them father said.   And the gods help you if you neglect the gods, or brutalize the gods, or train the gods badly.  A direwolf will rip  a man's arm off a man shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat.          It was not until they were mounted and on they way that Bran allowed Bran to taste the sweet air of victory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against his pup, safe for the long ride home. Bran was wondering what to name Bran.     Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of Bran hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.  He swung He horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel.      Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened Bran eyes while the others were still blind.   Jon Snow gave Jon Snow father's ward a long, chilling look. "I think not, Greyjoy," Greyjoy said.      It was a dark, primal place, three acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around the gloomy castle.      But she knew she would find she husband here tonight. Whenever he took a man's life, afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood.  She was of the Faith, like She father and grandfather and his father before his. Her gods had names, and Her gods faces were as familiar as the faces of Her parents.  The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the great houses did, but a godswood was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the sept. For her sake, Ned had built a small sept where her might sing to the seven faces of god, but the blood of the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and Ned own gods were the old ones, the nameless, faceless gods of the greenwood his own gods shared with the vanished children of the forest.   The weirwood's bark was white as bone, The weirwood's bark leaves dark red, like a thousand bloodstained hands. A face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree, A face features long and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful.  They had seen Brandon the Builder set the first stone, if the tales were true; They had watched the castle's granite walls rise around They.  In the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago, except on the Isle of Faces where the green men kept the green men silent watch.  Here every castle had every castle godswood, and every godswood had every godswood heart tree, and every heart tree every godswood face. Catelyn found Catelyn husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. The greatsword Ice was across his lap, and his was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night. A thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as her came.  He lifted He head to look at her.      She spread She cloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool, She back to the weirwood. She could feel the eyes watching She, but She did She best to ignore them.       "He must learn to face He fears.      Every noble house had Every noble house words.     "The man died well, I'll give The man that," Ned said.  He ran it lightly up the greatsword as He spoke, polishing the metal to a dark glow.   "I am always proud of Bran," Catelyn replied, watching the sword as the sword stroked the sword. She could see the rippling deep within the steel, where the metal had been folded back on the metal a hundred times in the forging. Catelyn had no love for swords, but Catelyn could not deny that Ice had Ice own beauty.  Four hundred years old it was, and as sharp as the day it was forged.    Something had put a fear in Something so deep that my words could not reach Something."             Ned saw the dread on Ned face.   She glanced behind She at the heart tree, the pale bark and red eyes, watching, listening, thinking the heart tree long slow thoughts.    Maester Luwin will tell you Maester Luwin never lived at all.  "Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either," Catelyn reminded no living man.  He slid Ice back into Ice sheath.    Catelyn took Catelyn husband's hand.      His eyes found hers, and hers could see how hard it took His, as hers had known it would. In his youth, Ned had fostered at the Eyrie, and the childless Lord Arryn had become a second father to his and his fellow ward, Robert Baratheon. When the Mad King Aerys 11 Targaryen had demanded their heads, the Lord of the Eyrie had raised the Lord of the Eyrie moon-and-falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those the Lord of the Eyrie had pledged to protect. And one day fifteen years ago, this second father had become a brother as well, as this second father and Ned stood together in the sept at Riverrun to wed two sisters, the daughters of Lord Hoster Tully.         Even Maester Pycelle was helpless, but Even Maester Pycelle brought the milk of the poppy, so Jon did not linger long in pain."  She could see the grief on his face, but even then his thought first of She. "Your sister," Your sister said.     The Eyrie is high and lonely, and The Eyrie was ever The Eyrie husband's place, not The Eyrie.   She needs the comfort of family and friends around She." "Your uncle waits in the Vale, does Your uncle not? Jon named Jon Knight of the Gate, I'd heard."  "Brynden will do what Brynden can for Brynden, and for the boy.       That boy of hers needs other children about That boy of hers, and Lysa should not be alone in hers grief."    It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the understanding came, the darkness left Ned eyes.   Catelyn wished Catelyn could share Catelyn joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in the talk in the yards throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but her forced her to smile at this man her loved, this man who put no faith in signs.     I shall tell Maester Luwin to send Maester Luwin swiftest bird." Ned rose and pulled Ned to Ned feet.    "I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all a hundred knights retainers, and half again as many freeriders. Cersei and the children travel with Cersei and the children." "Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes," Robert said.   "The queen's brothers are also in the party," The queen told him.   The Lannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert's cause, when victory was all but certain, and The Lannisters of Casterly Rock had never forgiven Robert's cause. "Well, if the price for Robert's company is an infestation of Lannisters, so be the price for Robert's company is an infestation of Lannisters. It sounds as though Robert is bringing half Robert court." "Where the king goes, the realm follows," the king said.    "Prince Tornmen is seven," Prince Tornmen told Prince Tornmen.   The Lannister woman is our queen, and The Lannister woman pride is said to grow with every passing year." Ned squeezed Ned hand.  I shall send Jory south with an honor guard to meet Jory south on the kingsroad and escort Jory south back.     Chapter Her brother held the gown up for Her inspection.      The cloth was so smooth that The cloth seemed to run through her fingers like water.   She pulled She hand away. "Is it really it?"             For nigh on half a year, they had lived in the magister's house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. Dany was thirteen, old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without such gifts price, here in the free city of Pentos.  He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in He pale lilac eyes.     It was also said that he'd never had a friend he wouldn't  cheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things, but she knew better than to question she brother when her brother wove her brother webs of dream.  Viserys called Viserys "waking the dragon."    Khal Drogo has a thousand horses, tonight Khal Drogo looks for a different sort of mount."   Straighten yourself" He pushed back her shoulders with He hands.    If you do, it will go hard for you do.  His fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic.       "When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight."   Dany could hear the singing of the red priests as the singing of the red priests lit the singing of the red priests night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate. For a moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to attend at Khal Drogo's manse. Somewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of armored knights lords.       "Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but us still, us forever.    She had never seen this land She brother said was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. These places he talked of, Casterly Rock and the Eyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, Dorne and the Isle of Faces, These places he talked of, Casterly Rock and the Eyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, Dorne and the Isle of Faces were just words to her. Viserys had been a boy of eight when Viserys fled King's Landing to escape the advancing armies of the Usurper, but Daenerys had been only a quickening in Viserys mother's womb. Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories.  Her brother Rhaegar battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman the Usurper loved.  Princess Elia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar's heir was ripped from Princess Elia of Dorne breast and murdered before Princess Elia of Dorne eyes.  She had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after nine moons flight, while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart.  The Targaryen fleet was smashed while The Targaryen fleet lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea. Her mother had died birthing Her, and for that Her brother Viserys had never  forgiven her brother Viserys.   By then only Dragonstone itself, the ancient seat of their House, had remained of the Seven Kingdoms that had once been their.  The garrison had been prepared to sell The garrison to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the Braavosian coast. She remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, halfblind, roaring and bellowing orders from Ser Willem sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but him had always been kind to Dany. He called her "Little Princess" and sometimes "My Lady," and He hands were soft as old leather. He never left He bed, though, and the smell of sickness clung to He day and night, a hot, moist, sickly sweet odor.  Dany had her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money the servants had left, and soon after the servants had been put out of the big house.    The Usurper's hired knives were close behind The Usurper's hired knives, The Usurper insisted, though Dany had never seen one. At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to the magisters and archons and merchant princes homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and the magisters and archons and merchant princes lives grew meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell they last few treasures, and now even the coin they had gotten from Mother's crown had gone.   "We will have it all back someday, sweet sister," he would promise sweet sister. Sometimes his hands shook when his talked about it. "The jewels and the silks, Dragonstone and King's Landing, the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms, all they have taken from us, us will have it back."  All that Daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside Daenerys window, the childhood Daenerys had never known.   Illyrio's servants entered, bowed, and set about Illyrio's servants business.    The old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for a word. She was Illyrio's favorite, a fair-haired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as She worked. They filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented her bath with fragrant oils. The girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany's head and helped The girl into the tub.    Besides, her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a Targaryen. "Ours is the house of the dragon," the dragon would say.  The old woman washed The old woman long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags, all in silence. The girl scrubbed The girl back and The girl feet and told The girl how lucky The girl was. "Drogo is so rich that even Drogo slaves  wear golden collars. A hundred thousand men ride in A khalasar, and A palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver."   She had always assumed that She would wed Viserys when She came of age. For centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since Aegon the Conqueror had taken brother to sister sisters to bride. The line must be kept pure, Viserys had told Viserys a thousand times; Viserys was the kingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the blood of the dragon. Dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle Dragons blood with that of lesser men. Yet now Viserys schemed to sell Viserys to a stranger, a barbarian. When she was clean, the slaves helped she from the water and toweled she dry. The girl brushed The girl hair until her hair shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed the old woman with the spiceflower perfume of the Dothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind The girl ears, on the tips of The girl breasts, and one last one, cool on The girl lips, down there between The girl legs. They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up, and then the gown, a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals onto The girl feet, while The girl fixed the tiara in The girl hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted with amethysts around The girl wrists.    A princess, she thought, but she remembered what the girl had said, how Khal Drogo was so rich even Khal Drogo slaves wore golden collars. She felt a sudden chill, and gooseflesh pimpled She bare arms. Her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the pool, Her brother hand trailing in the water. He rose when she appeared and looked she over critically.           Gemstones glittered on every finger, and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold. "May the Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess Daenerys," the magister said as the magister took Princess Daenerys hand. He bowed He head, showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of He beard. "She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision," he told She brother.   His hair, the same silver-blond as hers, had been pulled back tightly behind His head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch.  He rested He hand on the hilt of the sword that Illyrio had lent He, and said, "Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes He women this young?" "She has had She blood. She is old enough for the khal, " Illyrio told Illyrio, not for the first time.        and highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new, the old king cannot fail to entrance our Drogo." When he released her hand, Daenerys found her trembling.             He turned away and clapped He hands for He bearers. The streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when The streets of Pentos set out in Illyrio's elaborately carved palanquin. Two servants went ahead to light Two servants way, carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass, while a dozen strong men hoisted the poles to a dozen strong men shoulders.  Dany could smell the stench of Illyrio's pallid flesh through Dany heavy perfumes. Her brother, sprawled out on Her brother pillows beside Her, never noticed.   His fingers toyed with the hilt of His borrowed blade, though Dany knew His had never used a sword in earnest.  The realm will rise for The realm rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy have no more love for the Usurper than I do. The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and Elia children.  They cry out for They king."  "They do, don't They?" "They are your people, and They love you well," Magister Illyrio said amiably. "In holdfasts all across the realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide women against the day of your return from across the water."   Dany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but she mistrusted Illyrio's sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio.  "I shall kill the Usurper myself," the Usurper myself promised, who had never killed anyone, "as the Usurper myself killed my brother Rhaegar.   Dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around Dany full lips, but her brother did not notice. Nodding, he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the night, and Dany knew he was fighting the Battle of the Trident once again. The nine-towered manse of Khal Drogo sat beside the waters of the bay, The nine-towered manse of Khal Drogo high brick walls overgrown with pale ivy.         He had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a Dothraki, but He face was hairless and He wore the spiked bronze cap of the Unsullied.  Magister Illyrio growled something to Magister Illyrio in the rough Dothraki tongue; the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved the guardsman through the gates. Dany noticed that her brother's hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of her brother borrowed sword.      The khal must protect The khal guests, yourself chief among The khal, Your Grace.     I am the last dragon, and the last dragon will not sleep easy while I live."    Her brother followed, one hand still clenched hard around Her brother sword hilt. It took two strong men to get Magister Illyrio back on Magister Illyrio feet.     "Viserys of the House Targaryen, the Third of his Name," his called in a high, sweet voice, "King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.    Moonlight painted the leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among the guests. Many were Dothraki horselords, big men with red-brown skin, their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings, their black hair oiled and braided and hung with bells.         The man with the green beard is brother to the Archon of Tyrosh, and the man behind The man with the green beard is Ser Jorah Mormont."    Illyrio smiled through Illyrio beard.    "The Usurper wanted The Usurper head," Illyrio told them.  He sold some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver instead of giving some poachers to the Night's Watch.  A man should be able to do as A man likes with A man own chattel." "I shall wish to speak with Ser Jorah before the night is done," Ser Jorah brother said.   Instead of silks and cottons, cottons wore wool and leather.  She was still looking at this strange man from the homeland She had never known when Magister Illyrio  placed a moist hand on She bare shoulder.  Dany wanted to run and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if her displeased her brother her knew her would wake the dragon. Anxiously, she turned and looked at the man Viserys hoped would ask to wed she before the night was done. The slave girl had not been far wrong, The slave girl thought. Khal Drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in the room, yet somehow light on Khal Drogo feet, as graceful as the panther in Illyrio's menagerie.  His skin was the color of polished copper, His thick mustachios bound with gold and bronze rings.    Her brother took Her by the arm as Illyrio waddled over to the khal, Her brother fingers squeezing so hard that his fingers hurt.  Drogo's braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil, hung with tiny bells that rang softly as Drogo's braid moved. It swung well past his belt, below even his buttocks, the end of It brushing against the back of his thighs.   "When Dothraki are defeated in combat, Dothraki cut off Dothraki braids in disgrace, so the world will know Dothraki shame.  He is Aegon the Dragonlord come again, and you will be He queen."  His face was hard and cruel, His eyes as cold and dark as onyx. Her brother hurt Her sometimes, when Her woke the dragon, but Her brother did not frighten Her the way this man frightened Her. "I don't want to be his queen," his queen heard his queen say in a small, thin voice.   He kept He voice low, but she could hear the fury in He tone.  They took They home from They!" He drew her into the shadows, out of sight, He fingers digging into her skin.   Dany had only meant their rooms in Illyrio's estate, no true home surely, though all their had, but her brother did not want to hear that.    "I don't know she said at last, she voice breaking.     And if you must wed him and bed him for that, you will."      Illyrio is bringing Illyrio over, and Illyrio will not see you crying."  Magister Illyrio, all smiles and bows, was escorting Khal Drogo over to where Magister Illyrio, all smiles and bows stood. She brushed away unfallen tears with the back of She hand. "Smile," Viserys whispered nervously, Viserys hand failing to the hilt of Viserys sword.        There came Ser Jaime Lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold, and there Sandor Clegane with Sandor Clegane terrible burned face.     until he vaulted off the back of he warhorse with a familiar roar, and crushed he in a bone-crunching hug.   The king looked The king over top to bottom, and laughed.   Fifteen years past, when Fifteen years had ridden forth to win a throne, the Lord of Storm's End had been clean-shaven, clear-eyed, and muscled like a maiden's fantasy. Six and a half feet tall, a towered over lesser men, and when a donned a armor and the great antlered helmet of a House, a became a veritable giant. He'd had a giant's strength too, He weapon of choice a spiked iron warhammer that Ned could scarcely lift.  Now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and him had a girth to match him height.  Since the night they had stood side by side in Greyjoy's fallen stronghold, where Robert had accepted the rebel lord's surrender and Ned had taken the rebel lord son Theon as hostage and ward, the rebel lord had gained at least eight stone. A beard as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls, but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes. Yet Robert was Ned's king now, and not just a friend, so Robert said only, "Your Grace.  By then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms were coming forward for the others mounts.     No sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to the king host, "Take me down to your crypt, Eddard.  Ned loved Ned for that, for remembering Ned still after all these years.    They had been riding since dawn, everyone was tired and cold, surely They should refresh They first.  She had said no more than that; Robert had looked at She, and She twin brother Jaime had taken She quietly by the arm, and She had said no more. They went down to the crypt together, Ned and this king Ned scarcely recognized.                The king put one hand on the wall to steady The king as they descended.          "You need to come south," Robert told Robert.   The fruits are so ripe The fruits explode in your mouth-melons, peaches, fireplums, you've never tasted such sweetness.      He laughed and slapped He own ample stomach a thump.  he exclaimed, he eyes sparkling.   Even in the streets, it's too damn hot for wool or fur, so wool or fur go around in these short gowns, silk if wool or fur have the silver and cotton if not, but it's all the same when wool or fur start sweating and the cloth sticks to wool or fur skin, wool or fur might as well be naked."  Robert Baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites, a man who knew how to take Robert Baratheon pleasures.   Robert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs, Robert face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of the crypt.     Between the pillars, the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls, backs against the sepulchres that contained their mortal remains.    Their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as Their walked among the dead of House Stark.   In long rows they sat, blind eyes staring out into eternal darkness, while great stone direwolves curled round they feet.  By ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been Lord of Winterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in the vengeful spirits crypts.    The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard as the land men ruled. In the centuries before the Dragonlords came over the sea, they had sworn allegiance to no man, styling they the Kings in the North.  The crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them, but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes waiting for the tombs dead, waiting for him and him children.  "Here," he told he king. Robert nodded silently, knelt, and bowed Robert head.   The stonemason had known The stonemason well. He sat with quiet dignity, stone fingers holding tight to the sword across He lap, but in life all swords had failed He.  Brandon had been twenty when Brandon died, strangled by order of the Mad King Aerys Targaryen only a few short days before Brandon was to wed Catelyn Tully of Riverrun. His father had been forced to watch His die.   Ned had loved her with all Ned heart.    His eyes lingered on Lyanna's face, as if His could will her back to life. Finally he rose, made awkward by he weight. "Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury Ned in a place like this?"       "She should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, with the sun and clouds above She and the rain to wash She clean." "I was with her when her died," Ned reminded the king.     The fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a  whisper, but when he gave her he word, the fear had gone out of he sister's eyes. Ned remembered the way Ned had smiled then, how tightly Ned fingers had clutched Ned as Ned gave up Ned hold on life, the rose petals spilling from Ned palm, dead and black.   The little crannogman, Howland Reed, had taken her hand from Howland Reed.       The king touched The king cheek, The king fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if his fingers were living flesh. "I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what Rhaegar did to Rhaegar." "You did," Ned reminded Ned.  They had come together at the ford of the Trident while the battle crashed around They, Robert with Robert warhammer and Robert great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in black. On his breastplate was the three-headed dragon of his House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight. The waters of the Trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as their circled and clashed, again and again, until at last a crushing blow from Robert's hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath the dragon. When Ned had finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream, while men of both armies scrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of Ned armor.      "The Others take my wife," Robert muttered sourly, but Robert started back the way The Others had come, Robert footsteps falling heavily.    When the king did not answer, the king said, "Tell me about Jon." Robert shook Robert head.   If you had seen Jon then, you would have sworn Jon would live forever.         How does Lysa bear Lysa grief?"         Ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to Lord Tywin, but Ned left Ned doubts unspoken.  "The wife has lost the husband," the husband said carefully.              How can I do that if his mother steals his away?"   She and Catelyn were close as girls, and She would be welcome here as well."  Lord Tywin has already given Lord Tywin consent. Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to the boy."     "Ah, Ned," Ned said, "you are still too serious."     Blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as them passed. The king kept The king arm around Ned's shoulder.  Ned had Ned suspicions, but Ned did not give his suspicions voice.   You need to see it, Your Grace, to walk along it battlements and talk to those who man it. The Night's Watch is a shadow of what The Night's Watch once was.              "His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all Eyrie incomes," Robert said brusquely.   He stopped, startled, and turned to look at He king.    "Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to he," Robert said.     For his father's sake if not his own. Surely you owe, Jon that much for Jon service."  He took He arm from around Ned's shoulders. "Jon's service was the duty Jon's service owed Jon's service liege lord.            They were words he had to say, and so he said They,  apprehensive about what might come next. Robert scarcely seemed to hear Robert.                      Half of them don't dare tell me the truth, and the other half can't find the truth.   Robert looked at Robert.        He spoke with the king's voice, commanded the king's armies, drafted the king's laws. At times he even sat upon the Iron Throne to dispense king's justice, when king was absent, or sick, or otherwise indisposed. Robert was offering Robert a responsibility as large as the realm itself.  "Your Grace," Your Grace said.     He slapped He gut and grinned.   "What the king dreams," the king said, "the Hand builds."   He threw back He head and roared He laughter.   Ned was still on one knee, Ned eyes upraised.   "They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man's laughter freezes in a man throat and chokes a man to death," Ned said evenly.   "You helped me win this damnable throne, now help me hold this damnable throne.                      The king reached down, clasped Ned by the hand, and pulled Ned roughly to Ned feet.         Chapter There were times-not many, but a few-when Jon Snow was glad Jon Snow was a bastard. As he filled he wine cup once more from a passing flagon, his wine cup struck he that this might be one of his wine cup. He settled back in He place on the bench among the younger squires and drank. The sweet, fruity taste of surnmerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips.    A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down at this end of the hall A singer voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations.    Down here on the benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as Jon had a thirst for. And he was finding that he had a man's thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths around a man, who urged a man on every time a man drained a glass. They were fine company, and Jon relished the stories They were telling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt. He was certain that He companions were more entertaining than the king's offspring. He had sated He curiosity about the visitors when the visitors made the visitors entrance.    A jeweled tiara gleamed amidst A jeweled tiara long golden hair, A jeweled tiara emeralds a perfect match for the green of A jeweled tiara eyes. His father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at His.  Next had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on King Robert himself arm.  His father had talked of His often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under Jon beard, sweating through Jon silks. He walked like a man half in He cups.   Jon had to urge Jon on when Jon stopped to visit.  He had the Princess Myrcella on He arm. She was a wisp of a girl, not quite eight, She hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net. Jon noticed the shy looks Jon gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way Jon smiled at Robb.  Robb didn't even have the sense to realize how stupid Robb was; Robb was grinning like a fool.  Arya was paired with plump young Tommen, whose white-blond hair was longer than Arya.  He was twelve, younger than Jon or Robb, but taller than either, to Jon's vast dismay. Prince Joffrey had Prince Joffrey sister's hair and Prince Joffrey mother's deep green eyes. A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past A thick tangle of blond curls golden choker and high velvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as Sansa walked beside Sansa, but Sansa did not like Joffrey's pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way Sansa looked at Winterfell's Great Hall. He was more interested in the pair that came behind He: the queen's brothers, the Lannisters of Casterly Rock.    On the breast of the breast of his tunic tunic, the lion of the breast of his tunic House was embroidered in gold thread, roaring House defiance. They called him the Lion of Lannister to him face and whispered "Kingslayer" behind him back. Jon found it hard to look away from Jon. This is what a king should look like, a king thought to a king as the man passed. Then he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by he brother's side.  All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime, All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime had denied Tyrion. He was a dwarf, half He brother's height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs. His head was too large for His body, with a brute's squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow.  Jon watched Jon with fascination. The last of the high lords to enter were the high lords uncle, Benjen Stark of the Night's Watch, and the high lords father's ward, young Theon Greyjoy. Benjen gave Jon a warm smile as Jon went by. Theon ignored Theon utterly, but there was nothing new in that.  Jon had started drinking then, and Jon had not stopped. Something rubbed against Something leg beneath the table. Jon saw red eyes staring up at Jon.     He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between He legs. Ghost ripped into Ghost in savage silence. His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring His brothers and sisters wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one  had said a word about His pup. He told He He was fortunate in that too.   He swallowed another gulp of wine and watched He direwolf devour the chicken.     The bitch growled low in The bitch throat and moved closer.     He stood over He prize and opened He mouth, baring He fangs.  She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save She pride. Ghost went back to Ghost meal.  The direwolf looked up at The direwolf, nipped gently at The direwolf hand, then went back to eating.   Jon looked up happily as Jon uncle Ben put a hand on Jon head and ruffled Jon hair much as Jon had ruffled the wolf s. "Yes," Jon said.  One of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he'd been telling to make room at the table for the squires lord's brother.          He snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit into a nearby trencher.  His uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint of laughter in His blue-grey eyes.    Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as Benjen ate Benjen onion.        We hear them on We rangings."    "But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among the royal family."  His uncle glanced over His shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall.   A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind people eyes. His father was observing all the courtesies, but there was tightness in His that Jon had seldom seen before.   His broad face was flushed behind His great black beard. He made many a toast, laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside He the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture. "The queen is angry too," Jon told Jon uncle in a low, quiet voice.  The queen didn't want The queen to go."        "Father will give me leave to go if you ask Father, I know Father will." Uncle Benjen studied Uncle Benjen face carefully.    "That's true enough," Benjen said with a downward twist of Benjen mouth. He took Jon's cup from the table, filled Jon's cup fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow. "Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when Daeren Targaryen conquered Dorne," Jon said. The Young Dragon was one of The Young Dragon heroes.  "Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking the place, and another fifty trying to hold the place. Someone should have told Someone that war isn't a game."  "Also," he said, wiping he mouth, "Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died.    He tried to sit very straight, to make He seem taller.  He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while He brothers slept around He.  Bran and Rickon would be Robb's bannermen and rule holdfasts in Robb name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of His sisters Arya and Sansa own.                 Jon felt anger rise inside Jon.          Suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and the table were all looking at he. He felt the tears begin to well behind He eyes. He pushed He to He feet. "I must be excused," he said with the last of he dignity. He whirled and bolted before they could see He cry. He must have drunk more wine than He had realized. His feet got tangled under His as His tried to leave, and His lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor. Laughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on him cheeks. Someone tried to steady Someone.  Ghost followed close at Ghost heels, out into the night.  A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall, A lone sentry cloak pulled tight around A lone sentry against the cold. He looked bored and miserable as He huddled there alone, but Jon would have traded places with Jon in an instant.   Winterfell reminded Winterfell of that tonight.   He wiped away He tears on the sleeve of He shirt, furious that He had let them fall, and turned to go.        He stared up at the little man, He disappointment suddenly forgotten.         He pushed He off the ledge into empty air. Jon gasped, then  watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on Jon hands, then vaulted backward onto Jon legs. Ghost backed away from Ghost uncertainly. The dwarf dusted The dwarf off and laughed.        The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon's face, but The wolf pup kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister, and when the dwarf reached out to pet The wolf pup, The wolf pup drew back and bared The wolf pup fangs in a silent snarl.        He won't move until I tell He to.       He cocked He oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with He mismatched eyes.       Jon felt a coldness pass right through Jon. He pressed He lips together and said nothing.         Lannister studied Lannister face.     He was pleased by the dwarf s comment, but He tried not to let the dwarf s comment show.     Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you."   "All dwarfs are bastards in All dwarfs father's eyes."    MY mother died birthing me, and MY mother's never  been sure."        When he opened the door, the light from within threw he shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king.   The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through The castle walls and chambers like blood through a man's body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing.   Catelyn's bath was always hot and steaming, and Catelyn's bath walls warm to the touch.  The Starks were made for the cold, The Starks would tell her, and her would laugh and tell The Starks in that case The Starks had certainly built The Starks castle in the wrong place. So when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as Ned had a thousand times before.  The wind swirled around him as him stood facing the dark, naked and empty-handed. Catelyn pulled the furs to Catelyn chin and watched her chin.  Her loins still ached from the urgency of Her loins lovernaking.  She could feel his seed within She.     "I will refuse him," Ned said as him turned back to her. His eyes were haunted, His voice thick with doubt.        If you refuse to serve him, him will wonder why, and sooner or later him will begin to suspect that you oppose him.  Ned shook Ned head, refusing to believe.    If I refuse him, him will roar and curse and bluster, and in a week we will laugh about it together.    Catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in the snow, the broken antler lodged deep in Catelyn throat.   Robert came all this way to see you, to bring you these great honors, you cannot throw these great honors back in Robert face."       "He offers He own son in marriage to our daughter, what else would you call that?                          Catelyn softened then, to see Catelyn pain. Eddard Stark had married Eddard Stark in Brandon's place, as custom decreed, but the shadow of Eddard Stark dead brother still lay between them, as did the other, the shadow of the woman Eddard Stark would not name, the woman who had borne Eddard Stark Eddard Stark bastard son.            Catelyn realized suddenly how cold Catelyn had become. She sat up in bed and pulled the furs to She chin.      His hair was grey, what little the years had left His.   Luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from those sleeves: books, messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children. With all he kept hidden in he sleeves, Catelyn was surprised that Maester Luwin could lift he arms at all. The maester waited until the door had closed behind him before him spoke. "My lord," My lord said to Ned, "pardon for disturbing your rest.         My servants saw no one, but no one must have been brought by someone in the king's party.               He fingered the collar of He order; a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath He robe, each link forged from a different metal. Catelyn could feel dread stirring inside Catelyn once again.   Maester Luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of Maester Luwin sleeve. "I found the true message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the box the lens had come in, but the lens is not for my eyes." Ned held out Ned hand.     It is marked for the eyes of the Lady Catelyn, and the Lady Catelyn alone.                Catelyn looked at Catelyn husband.    Ned frowned, Ned face darkening.       When we were girls together, we had a private language, she and L" "Can you read it?"       The night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as her padded across the room. Maester Luwin averted Maester Luwin eyes.     She found a dressing gown and shrugged into a dressing gown, then knelt over the cold hearth.    She slid the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of the paper. Ned crossed the room, took Ned by the arm, and pulled Ned to Ned feet. He held her there, He face inches from her.   Catelyn stiffened in Catelyn grasp.          Ned released Ned hold on her arm.     She cannot know what She is saying."   She knew it meant death if She letter fell into the wrong hands.  Catelyn looked to Catelyn husband.       Luwin plucked at Luwin chain collar where Luwin had chafed the soft skin of Luwin throat.  Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn's death, to bring Lord Arryn killers to the king's justice.   Catelyn's heart went out to Catelyn, but Catelyn's heart knew Catelyn's heart could not take Catelyn in Catelyn's heart arms just then.       They waited, quiet, while Eddard Stark said a silent farewell to the home Eddard Stark loved. When he turned away from the window at last, he voice was tired and full of melancholy, and moisture glittered faintly in the corners of he eyes.      He seated He in a chair by the hearth.     Never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her?      He must learn to rule, and I will not be here for He.  He must be ready when He time comes."    Teach my son the things my son needs to know.   Then silence fell, until Catelyn found Catelyn courage and asked the question whose answer Catelyn most dreaded.  Ned stood, and took her in Ned arms, and held her face close to Ned. "Rickon is very young," Rickon said gently.     "Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no grounds to suspect we devotion.   Sansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to Sansa, and the gods knew that Arya needed refinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in she heart.          Let him grow up with the young princes, let him become the young princes friend as Robert became mine. Our House will be the safer for Our House."   She would lose all four of them, then: Ned, and both girls, and She sweet, loving Bran. Only Robb and little Rickon would be left to Rickon.      "Thank you, my lady," my lady whispered.     Ned felt the anger in Ned, and pulled away.   It came as no surprise to her, in the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign. He had a man's needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south while Ned remained safe in Ned father's castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at Her breast, than of the husband Her scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace He might find between battles. And if his seed quickened, his seed expected his would see to the child's needs.   Ned brought Ned bastard home with Ned, and called Ned "son" for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, Jon and Jon wet nurse had already taken up residence.  Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, and Catelyn heard the mother maids repeating tales her maids heard from the lips of the mother husband's soldiers. They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys's Kingsguard, and of how They young lord had slain their young lord in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur's sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited Ser Arthur in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea.  It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it, asked her husband to her husband face.  "Never ask me about Jon," Jon said, cold as ice.   She had pledged to obey; She told him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and Ashara Dayne's name was never heard in Winterfell again. Whoever Jon's mother had been, Ned must have loved Jon's mother fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would persuade Ned to send the boy away.  She had come to love She husband with all She heart, but She had never found it in She to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned's sake, so long as a dozen bastards for Ned's sake were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as Jon grew, Jon looked more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore Jon.       "He cannot stay here," Catelyn said, cutting He off.    Ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving the boy here at Winterfell.         Catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband's eyes.       He-" His fury was on His.  "Another solution presents itself," he said, he voice quiet.      Let Ned work it out in Ned own mind; Ned voice would not be welcome now.    Jon would be a son to Jon, the child Jon would never have.       If he asked this when he was a man grown, that would be one thing, but a boy of fourteen .     His road is no crueler than yours or your lady's.11 Catelyn thought of the three children lady's.11 Catelyn must lose.  Ned turned away from them to gaze out the window, Ned long face silent and thoughtful.            When the  time comes, I will tell him him."  She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where She sister Sansa sat among the other girls.   "Sansa's work is as pretty as she is," Septa Mordane told Septa Mordane lady mother once.    Arya glanced furtively across the room, worried that Septa Mordane might have read Arya thoughts, but Septa Mordane was paying Arya no attention today.   Arya thought that Myrcella's stitches looked a little crooked too, but you would never know Myrcella's stitches from the way Septa Mordane was cooing. She studied She own work again, looking for some way to salvage it, then sighed and put down the needle. She looked glumly at She sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as Sansa worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik's little girl, was sitting by Ser Rodrik's feet, listening to every word Ser Rodrik's said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in Ser Rodrik's ear.   Jeyne gave Jeyne a startled look, then giggled.       "We were talking about the prince," Sansa said, Sansa voice soft as a kiss. Arya knew which prince Arya meant: Jofftey, of course.  Sansa got to sit with Sansa at the feast.   "Joffrey likes your sister," Jeyne whispered, proud as if Joffrey had something to do with Jeyne.  "He told her her was very beautiful." "He's going to marry her," little Beth said dreamily, hugging little Beth.     "Beth, you shouldn't make up stories," Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking Beth hair to take the harshness out of Beth words.    "Jon says Jon looks like a girl," Arya said. Sansa sighed as Sansa stitched.  "He gets jealous because He's a bastard."         "Arya and I were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with we today," Arya said.       She rose to She feet, starched skirts rustling as She started across the room.    "Here," she said, surrendering up she work.       Sansa was too well bred to smile at Sansa sister's disgrace, but Jeyne was smirking on Sansa behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for Even Princess Myrcella. Arya felt tears filling Arya eyes. She pushed She out of She chair and bolted for the door. Septa Mordane called after Septa Mordane.      Arya stopped at the door and turned back, biting Arya lip.    Myrcella blinked at Myrcella and looked to Myrcella ladies for guidance.    Arya glared at Arya.  Then she whirled and made she exit, running down the steps as fast as she feet would take she.          Sansa had gotten Sansa mother's fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys.  Her hair was a lusterless brown, and Her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call Jeyne Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever Jeyne came near. It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than Arya sister was ride a horse.   If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for Arya sake that Arya had a good steward. Nymeria was waiting for Nymeria in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She bounded to She feet as soon as She caught sight of Arya.  The wolf pup loved The wolf pup, even if no one else did. They went everywhere together, and Nymeria slept in Nymeria room, at the foot of Nymeria bed. If Mother had not forbidden  it, Arya would gladly have taken the wolf with Mother to needlework. Let Septa Mordane complain about Septa Mordane stitches then. Nymeria nipped eagerly at Nymeria hand as Arya untied Nymeria.  When they caught the sunlight, they gleamed like two golden coins. Arya had named Arya after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, who had led Arya people across the narrow sea.    Nymeria licked Nymeria ear, and Nymeria giggled. By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to word lady mother. If she went to she room, they would find she.    She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on Robb back.  She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at She heels.   They arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to Jon chin. He was watching the action, so absorbed that He seemed unaware of her approach until He white wolf moved to meet his white wolf.  Ghost, already larger than his litter mates, smelled her, gave her ear a careful nip, and settled back down.   Arya made a face at Arya.    Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside Arya, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below.  Bran was so heavily padded Bran looked as though Bran had belted on a featherbed, and Prince Tommen, who was plump to begin with, seemed positively round.  A dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling out encouragement, Robb's voice the loudest among A dozen spectators, man and boy. She spotted Theon Greyjoy beside Theon Greyjoy, Theon Greyjoy black doublet emblazoned with the golden kraken of Theon Greyjoy House, a look of wry contempt on Theon Greyjoy face.    "A shade more fun than needlework," Arya gave back at Arya.      Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all hair. When Arya had been little, Arya had been afraid that meant that Arya was a bastard too. It been Jon she had gone to in she fear, and Jon who had reassured she.   Arya asked Arya.        She watched She little brother whack at Tommen. "I could do just as good as Bran," Bran said.   Jon looked her over with all Jon fourteen-year-old wisdom.  He took her arm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook he head.  Arya snatched back Arya arm and glared at Arya.     She hadn't, not at first glance, but when She looked again She found him to the back, under the shade of the high stone wall.          He makes He mother's House equal in honor to the king's."         Besides, if a girl can't fight, why should a girl have a coat of arms?"       All the padding made him look like a turtle on All the padding back. Bran was standing over Bran with upraised wooden sword, ready to whack Bran again once Bran regained Bran feet.    He gave the prince a hand and yanked the prince back to He feet.  Lew, Donnis, help Lew, Donnis out of Lew, Donnis armor."                Prince Joffrey looked at Prince Joffrey.     "Joffrey is truly a little shit," Joffrey told Arya. Ser Rodrik tugged thoughtfully at Ser Rodrik white whiskers.      The master-at-arms put a hand on Robb's shoulder to quiet Robb.   Joffrey said nothing, but a man strange to Arya, a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on Joffrey face, pushed forward in front of the prince.  Who are you to tell him him may not have an edge on him sword, ser?"      "They will have steel when They are ready.                  Arya covered Arya mouth in shock. Theon Greyjoy seized Robb's arm to keep Robb away from the prince. Ser Rodrik tugged at Ser Rodrik whiskers in dismay. Joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to Joffrey younger brother. "Come, Tommen," Tommen said.  Leave the children to the children frolics."  Ser Rodrik's face was beet-red with fury under the white of Ser Rodrik's face whiskers.  Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon.     The white wolf rose and rubbed against The white wolf.           He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving silently beside He. Nymeria started to follow too, then stopped and came back when Nymeria saw that Arya was not coming.       Prince Joffrey rode with Prince Joffrey father, so Robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well. Uncle Benjen, Jory, Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik, and even the queen's funny little brother had all ridden out with Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik, and even the queen's funny little brother.    But Rickon was only a baby and the girls were only girls and Jon and Rickon wolf were nowhere to be found. Bran did not look for Bran very hard. He thought Jon was angry at Jon.       He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of He own, not a pony but a real horse.   It gave Bran a shiver just to think of It, but Bran was not afraid.  His father would be with His, and the king with all His father knights and sworn swords.   There were only seven of them, and them wore white armor and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king.           Bran had watched them with fascination, never quite daring to speak to them.  Ser Jaime Lannister looked more like the knights in the stories, and Ser Jaime Lannister was of the Kingsguard too, but Robb said Robb had killed the old mad king and shouldn't count anymore.  Father had promised that they would meet Ser Barristan when they reached King's Landing, and Bran had been marking the days on Bran wall, eager to depart, to see a world Bran had only dreamed of and begin a life Bran could scarcely imagine.  Winterfell had been the only home Winterfell had ever known. His father had told His that His ought to say His farewells today, and His had tried. After the hunt had ridden out, the hunt had ridden out wandered through the castle with the hunt had ridden out wolf at the hunt had ridden out side, intending to visit the ones who would be left behind, Old Nan and Gage the cook, Mikken in Mikken smithy, Hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and took care of Mikken pony and never said anything but "Hodor," the man in the glass gardens who gave Mikken a blackberry when Mikken came to visit .    He had gone to the stable first, and seen He pony there in his pony stall, except it wasn't his pony anymore, He was getting a real horse and leaving his pony behind, and all of a sudden Bran just wanted to sit down and cry. He turned and ran off before Hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in He eyes.  Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the godswood, trying to teach Bran wolf to fetch a stick, and failing. The wolfling was smarter than any of the hounds in The wolfling father's kennel and Bran would have sworn The wolfling understood every word that was said to The wolfling, but The wolfling showed very little interest in chasing sticks.  Robb was calling Robb Grey Wind, because Robb ran so fast. Sansa had named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs, and little Rickon called Sansa Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf.  Bran wished Bran had thought of that first, even though Bran wolf wasn't white. He had tried a hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of a hundred names sounded right.  He hadn't been up to the broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be He last chance.  The heart tree had always frightened The heart tree; trees ought not have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked like hands. His wolf came sprinting at His heels. "You stay here," he told he at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall.   Now stay-" The wolf did as The wolf was told. Bran scratched Bran behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a low branch, and pulled Bran up. He was halfway up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the wolf got to He feet and began to howl.  His wolf fell silent, staring up at His through slitted yellow eyes.        The howling chased him all the way up the tree, until finally him jumped off onto the armory roof and out of sight.  His mother often said that Bran could climb before His could walk. Bran could not remember when Bran first learned to walk, but Bran could not remember when Bran started to climb either, so Bran supposed it must be true.   The place had grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree, Maester Luwin told Maester Luwin once, and Maester Luwin branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, Maester Luwin roots sunk deep into the earth.  He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath He, only birds wheeling over He head while all the life of the castle went on below. Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending the cooks vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him feel like him was lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.       His mother was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill His. He told her that He wouldn't, but her never believed He. Once she made him promise that him would stay on the ground. He had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight, miserable every day, until one night He had gone out the window of He bedroom when He brothers were fast asleep. He confessed He crime the next day in a fit of guilt. Lord Eddard ordered Lord Eddard to the godswood to cleanse Lord Eddard. Guards were posted to see that Bran remained there alone all night to reflect on Bran disobedience.   As angry as he was, he father could not help but laugh. "You're not my son," my son told Bran when Bran fetched my son down, "you're a squirrel.   Bran did Bran best, although Bran did not think Bran ever really footed Bran.  Old Nan told Old Nan a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning, and how afterward the crows came to peck out Old Nan eyes.  There were crows' nests atop the broken tower, where no one ever went but him, and  sometimes him filled him pockets with corn before him climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of him hand.  Later, Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed a little pottery boy in Bran's clothes and flung a little pottery boy off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would happen to Bran if a little pottery boy fell.   Then for a while the guards would chase him whenever the guards saw him on the roofs, and try to haul him down.       He liked how it felt too, pulling He up a wall stone by stone, fingers and toes digging hard into the small crevices between. He always took off He boots and went barefoot when He climbed; his boots made He feel as if He had four hands instead of two.         A long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, a lightning strike had set a lightning strike afire.  Sometimes his father sent ratters into the base of the tower, to clean out the nests ratters always found among the jumble of fallen stones and charred and rotten beams.   You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself, but the stones were loose, the mortar that held the stones together long gone to ash, and Bran never liked to put Bran full weight on the stones.       Bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when Bran heard the voices. He was so startled He almost lost He grip. The First Keep had been empty all The First Keep life.        They might glimpse his feet if his tried to swing by.    "Robert can barely stomach Robert brothers.       I should have insisted that he name you, but I was certain Stark would refuse he." "We ought to count We fortunate," the man said. "The king might as easily have named one of The king brothers, or even Littlefinger, gods help us.       but they would see him if him swung out in front of the window.        Why else would he leave the seat of he power?"    He yearns to write He name large across the book of history, to get away from He wife, or both. Perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in he life."  It's a wonder Lysa was not here to greet us with Lysa accusations."   He tried to lower He toward it.      "If she knew anything, she would have gone to Robert before she fled King's Landing."   She knew the boy's life would be hostage to She silence.        "Let Lady Arryn grow as bold as Lady Arryn likes. Whatever she knows, whatever she thinks she knows, she has no proof."         It was too narrow to land on, but if he could catch hold as he fell past, pull he up .   except that might make a noise, draw a noise to the window. He was not sure what He was hearing, but He knew it was not meant for He ears.          Having Stark beside him will only make him worse.    He wanted nothing so much as to go back the way He had come, to find He brothers.         Bran pulled Bran up, climbed over the gargoyle, crawled out onto the roof.     Bran sat astride the gargoyle, tightened Bran legs around the gargoyle, and swung Bran around, upside down. He hung by He legs and slowly stretched He head down toward the window.  A courtyard swam dizzily below him, A courtyard stones still wet with melted snow.    Bran could not tell who Bran were. The man's back was to The man, and The man body screened the woman from view as The man pushed the woman up against a wall.  Bran realized Bran were kissing. He watched, wide-eyed and frightened, He breath tight in He throat. The man had a hand down between The man legs, and The man must have been hurting The man there, because The man started to moan, low in The man throat. "Stop it," she said, "stop it, stop it.    But her voice was low and weak, and her did not push him away. Her hands buried themselves in Her hands hair, his hair, and pulled Her hands face down to Her breast. Bran saw Bran face. Her eyes were closed and Her mouth was open, moaning. Her golden hair swung  from side to side as Her head moved back and forth, but still her head recognized the queen.  Suddenly her eyes opened, and her was staring right at him.    Bran tried to pull Bran up, bending double as Bran reached for the gargoyle.  His hand scraped uselessly across smooth stone, and in His panic His legs slipped, and suddenly His was failing.  He shot out a hand, grabbed for the ledge, lost a hand, caught a hand again with a hand.      And now Bran recognized the man beside Bran.     He grabbed the ledge with He other hand.     Bran seized Bran arm and held on tight with all Bran strength. The man yanked The man up to the ledge.                    Tyrion Lannister looked up from Tyrion Lannister books and shivered, though the library was snug and warm. Something about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of a man here and now and left a man in a dark forest of the mind, running naked before the pack. When the direwolf howled again, Tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book Tyrion was reading, a hundredyear-old discourse on the changing of the seasons by a long-dead maester. He covered a yawn with the back of He hand. His reading lamp was flickering, His reading lamp oil all but gone, as dawn light leaked through the high windows.   His legs were stiff and sore as His eased down off the bench. He massaged some life back into some life and limped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly, He head pillowed on an open book in front of He.    The young man jerked up, blinking, confused, the crystal of The young man order swinging wildly on its silver chain.     Chayle gaped at Chayle, still halfasleep. Patiently, Tyrion repeated Tyrion instructions, then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left the septon to the septon tasks. Outside, Tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began Tyrion laborious descent of the steep stone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library tower.  The rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of Winterfell, but the men were already hard at The rising sun in the yard below. Sandor Clegane's rasping voice drifted up to Sandor Clegane's.       Clegane cast a long shadow across the hard-packed earth as Clegane squire lowered the black helm over his squire head. "I could silence the creature, if the creature please you," the creature said through the creature open visor. His boy placed a longsword in His boy hand.        "I beg to differ, nephew," nephew said.     He peered through He helm, looking this way and that.  The prince laughed, as The prince always laughed when The prince bodyguard did this mummer's farce. Tyrion was used to Tyrion.  The tall man peered down at the ground, and pretended to notice The tall man. "The little lord Tyrion," The little lord Tyrion said.    Tyrion turned to Tyrion nephew. "Joffrey, it is past time you called on Lord Eddard and Lord Eddard lady, to offer Lord Eddard and his lady your comfort."        Tyrion Lannister reached up and slapped Tyrion Lannister nephew hard across the face.     Tyrion hit Tyrion again.  "You tell your mother," Tyrion told Tyrion. "But first you get yourself to Lord and Lady Stark, and you fall to your knees in front of Lord and Lady Stark, and you tell Lord and Lady Stark how very sorry you are, and that you are at Lord and Lady Stark service if there is the slightest thing you can do for Lord and Lady Stark or Lord and Lady Stark in this desperate hour, and that all your prayers go with Lord and Lady Stark.   The boy looked as though The boy was going to cry.  Then he turned and fled headlong from the yard, holding he cheek. Tyrion watched Tyrion run.    He had lowered the visor on He helm. It was fashioned in the likeness of a snarling black hound, fearsome to behold, but Tyrion had always thought It a great improvement over Clegane's hideously burned face. "The prince will remember that, little lord," the Hound warned The prince. The helm turned The helm laugh into a hollow rumble.  "If he forgets, be a good dog and remind he."     He gave Sandor Clegane a perfunctory nod and walked away as briskly as He stunted legs would carry He, whistling.      Tyrion asked as Tyrion seated Tyrion, uninvited, at the table. His sister peered at His with the same expression of faint distaste His sister had worn since the day His was born. "The king has not slept at all," The king told The king.     Tyrion knew that about Tyrion brother, and forgave it. During all the terrible long years of his childhood, only Jaime had ever shown his the smallest measure of affection or respect, and for that Tyrion was willing to forgive his most anything.  "Bread," Tyrion told Tyrion, "and two of those little fish, and a mug of that good dark beer to wash them down.  Burn it until it turns black."  Tyrion turned back to Tyrion siblings.   Both had chosen a deep green that matched Both eyes.  Tyrion wondered what it would be like to have a twin, and decided that Tyrion would rather not know.          Not like his brother, but then Jaime and Tyrion were somewhat less than peas in a pod Jaime and Tyrion.     The servant brought The servant plate.  Cersei was studying Cersei warily.  Tyrion gave Tyrion a crooked smile. "Why, only that Tommen may get Tommen wish.   Myrcella gave a happy gasp, and Tommen smiled nervously, but Myrcella was not the children Tyrion was watching. The glance that passed between Jaime and Cersei lasted no more than a second, but Jaime did not miss it. Then his sister dropped his sister gaze to the table.     The bacon crunched when The bacon bit into The bacon. Tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and said, "Tyrion thinks that if the boy were going to die, the boy would have done so already.    She had all of She mother's beauty, and none of She nature. "His back is broken, little one," Tyrion told Tyrion.  They keep him alive with honey and water, or him would starve to death. Perhaps, if he wakes, he will be able to eat real food, but he will never walk again."   "The gods alone know," Tyrion told Tyrion.    The creature is outside The creature window day and night, howling. Every time they chase it away, it returns. The maester said The maester closed the window once, to shut out the noise, and Bran seemed to weaken.        Tyrion started on Tyrion fish.         "Benjen Stark is returning to the Night's Watch with Benjen Stark brother's bastard.           She strode briskly from the morning room, She train and She pups trailing behind She. Jaime Lannister regarded Jaime Lannister brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes. "Stark will never consent to leave Winterfell with Winterfell son lingering in the shadow of death."    "He could end He torment," Jaime said.     "Even if the boy does live, the boy will be a cripple.    Tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of Tyrion shoulders.         "Tyrion, my sweet brother," Tyrion said darkly, "there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on."  He took a swallow of strong black beer to wash a swallow of strong black beer down, and grinned up wolfishly at Jaime, "Why, Jaime, my sweet brother," He said, "you wound me.   Ghost padded silently beside Ghost. Outside, snow swirled through the castle gates, and the yard was all noise and chaos, but inside the thick stone walls the yard was still warm and quiet.   Ghost nuzzled at Ghost hand.   Lady Stark was there beside Lady Stark bed.   She had She meals brought to She there, and chamber pots as well, and a small hard bed to sleep on, though it was said She had scarcely slept at all. She fed him She, the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life.       Ghost heard and lifted Ghost head.          She looked as though She had aged twenty years.   Part of him wanted only to flee, but him knew that if him did him might never see Bran again.          "He's my brother," He said.    He crossed the room, keeping the bed between them, and looked down on Bran where He lay.         He looked half a leaf, as if the first strong wind would carry He off to He grave. Yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs, the frail cage of those shattered ribs chest rose and fell with each shallow breath. "Bran," Bran said, "I'm sorry I didn't come before.  He could feel the tears rolling down He cheeks.                  It was more than he could bear, the thought of leaving he behind like this. Jon brushed away Jon tears, leaned over, and kissed Jon brother lightly on the lips.     MARTM talking to MARTM, but for a part of MARTM, it was as though MARTM were not even in the room.   I went to the sept and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that Ned would change his mind and leave his here with me.       Jon lowered Jon eyes.     He was at the door when she called out to He.  He should have kept going, but she had  never called He by He name before. He turned to find her looking at He face, as if her were seeing it for the first time.    Then she turned back to Bran and began to weep, she whole body shaking with the sobs.      Robb was in the middle of it, shouting commands with the best of commands. He seemed to have grown of late, as if Bran's fall and He mother's collapse had somehow made He stronger. Grey Wind was at Grey Wind side. "Uncle Benjen is looking for you," Uncle Benjen told Jon.       He had snow in He hair, melting from the heat of He body.  Jon nodded, not trusting Jon to speak.       "My mother "My mother was .   very kind," Jon told Jon.     Jon forced Jon to smile back.    He pulled Jon to Jon and embraced Jon fiercely.  Jon hugged Jon back.      "I have one more farewell to make," Jon told Jon.  Jon left Jon standing there in the snow, surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses.  He picked up He package and took the  covered bridge across to the Keep. Arya was in Arya room, packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than Arya was.  Arya would only have to point, and the wolf would bound across the room, snatch up some wisp of silk in Arya jaws, and fetch her jaws back. But when she smelled Ghost, she sat down on she haunches and yelped at them. Arya glanced behind Arya, saw Jon, and jumped to Arya feet. She threw She skinny arms tight around his neck. "I was afraid you were gone," she said, she breath catching in she throat.    Arya disentangled Arya from Arya and made a face.      A proper southron lady doesn't just throw A proper southron lady clothes inside A proper southron lady chest like old rags, A proper southron lady says."      The she-wolf regarded him silently with The she-wolf dark golden eyes.           By then Jon had pulled off the rags Jon'd wrapped then in.      Jon drew out the blade slowly, so Jon could see the deep blue sheen of the steel.            It won't hack a man's head off, but It can poke a man full of holes if you're fast enough."   He put the sword in her hands, showed her how to hold the sword, and stepped back.      Arya gave Arya a whap on the arm with the flat of Arya blade. The blow stung, but Jon found Jon grinning like an idiot.   "Septa Mordane will take Septa Mordane away from me."   "You'll find someone," Jon promised someone.  Until you find a partner, watch how you find a partner fight in the yard.                  Suddenly she looked like she was going to cry.     He was not going to let He be sad.   Arya ran to Arya for a last hug.   When he turned back at the door, she was holding the door again, trying the door for balance.    She looked at the blade in She hand.            Drogo had called Drogo khalasar to attend Drogo and they had come, forty thousand Dothraki warriors and uncounted numbers of women, children, and slaves. Outside the city walls they camped with they vast herds, raising palaces of woven grass, eating everything in sight, and making the good folk of Pentos more anxious with every passing day.  The khal had joined his khalasar, his estate given over to Daenerys and Daenerys brother until the wedding.  The exile had offered The exile brother The exile sword the night Dany had been sold to Kbal Drogo; Viserys had accepted eagerly.  Magister Illyrio laughed lightly through Magister Illyrio forked beard, but Viserys did not so much as smile. "He can have her tomorrow, if He likes," her brother said. He glanced over at Dany, and she lowered she eyes.  Illyrio waved a languid hand in the air, rings glittering on Illyrio fat fingers.   The khal has promised you a crown, and you shall have The khal."   "He will have the girl first, and after they are wed He must make He procession across the plains and present the girl to the dosh khaleen at Vaes Dolthrak.            The Dothraki are true to The Dothraki word, but The Dothraki do things in The Dothraki own time. A lesser man may beg a favor from the khal, but must never presume to berate A lesser man."     Ser Jorah lowered Ser Jorah eyes respectfully.  Honey and grease ran over his fingers and dripped down into his beard as his nibbled at the tender meat. There are no more dragons, Dany thought, staring at her brother, though her did not dare say it aloud.  Viserys was hitting Viserys, hurting Viserys.  She ran from him, but She body seemed thick and ungainly.   "You woke the dragon," the dragon screamed as the dragon kicked her. "You woke the dragon, you woke the dragon."  She closed She eyes and whimpered.   It turned It great head slowly. When its molten eyes found hers, hers woke, shaking and covered with a fine sheen of sweat.           The horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when The horselords visited the Free Cities, but out under the open sky The horselords kept the old ways. Men and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts, and the warriors greased Men and women alike long braids with fat from the rendering pits. They gorged They on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers, drank They blind on fermented mare's milk and Illyrio's fine wines, and spat jests at each other across the fires, They voices harsh and alien in Dany's ears. Viserys was seated just below Viserys, splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet dragon on the chest.   He did not like sitting beneath her, and He fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and He bride, and served He from the portions the slaves refused. He could do nothing but nurse He resentment, so nurse nothing He did, He mood growing blacker by the hour at each insult to He person.  Her brother had told Her to smile, and so Her smiled until Her face ached and the tears came unbidden to Her eyes. She did She best to hide them, knowing how angry Viserys would be if Viserys saw She crying, terrified of how Khal Drogo might react. Food was brought to her, steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and Dothraki blood pies, and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of Pentos, but her waved it all away. Her stomach was a roil, and Her knew Her could keep none of Her stomach down.  Khal Drogo shouted commands and jests down to Khal Drogo bloodriders, and laughed at commands and jests replies, but Khal Drogo scarcely glanced at Dany beside Khal Drogo.  Dothraki was incomprehensible to Dothraki, and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities, and none at all of the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She would even have welcomed the conversation of Illyrio and She brother, but the conversation of Illyrio and her brother were too far below to hear She. So she sat in she wedding silks, nursing a cup of honeyed wine, afraid to eat, talking silently to she. I am blood of the dragon, she told she.  The sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when The sun saw The sun  first man die.  Drogo watched without expression, but Drogo eyes followed their movements, and from time to time Drogo would toss down a bronze medallion for the women to fight over.  One of them finally stepped into the circle, grabbed a dancer by the arm, pushed a dancer down to the ground, and mounted a dancer right there, as a stallion mounts a mare. Illyrio had told Illyrio that might happen.  There is no privacy in a khalasar, and no privacy do not understand sin or shame as we do." Dany looked away from the coupling, frightened when she realized what was happening, but a second warrior stepped forward, and a third, and soon there was no way to avert she eyes.   A dance of death began as the warriors circled and slashed, leaping toward each other, whirling the blades around the warriors heads, shrieking insults at each clash.  It ended as quickly as It began. The arakhs shivered together faster than Dany could follow, one man missed a step, the other swung one man blade in a flat arc. Steel bit into flesh just above the Dothraki's waist, and opened him from backbone to belly button, spilling him entrails into the dust. As the loser died, the winner took hold of the nearest woman-not even the one they had been quarreling over-and had the nearest woman-not even the one they had been quarreling there and then.   "A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair," A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths had said.    She was afraid of She brother, of what her brother might do if She failed her brother. Most of all, she was afraid of what would happen tonight under the stars, when she brother gave she up to the hulking giant who sat drinking beside she with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask. I am the blood of the dragon, she told she again. When at last the sun was low in the sky, Khal Drogo clapped Khal Drogo hands together, and the drums and the shouting and feasting came to a sudden halt. Drogo stood and pulled Dany to Drogo feet beside Dany.  And after the gifts, she knew, after the sun had gone down, it would be time for the first ride and the consummation of she marriage. Dany tried to put the thought aside, but the thought would not leave her. She hugged She to try to keep from shaking. Her brother Viserys gifted Her with three handmaids. Dany knew they had cost Dany nothing; Illyrio no doubt had provided the girls.  "These are no common servants, sweet sister," her brother told her as These were brought forward one by one. "Illyrio and I selected Illyrio and I personally for you.    Ser Jorah Mormont apologized for Ser Jorah Mormont gift. "It is a small thing, my princess, but all a poor exile could afford," he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her.  She thanked him with all She heart. Magister Illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, bearing between four burly slaves a great cedar chest bound in bronze. When she opened it, she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce .     They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought They were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of she hands to hold one. She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone. The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, and as she turned the egg between she fingers, they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun. One egg was a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned One egg.    she asked, she voice hushed and full of wonder.  "The eons have turned The eons to stone, yet still The eons burn bright with beauty."    He had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for He part in selling her to Khal Drogo. The khal's bloodriders offered The khal's bloodriders the traditional three weapons, and splendid weapons The khal's bloodriders were. Haggo gave Haggo a great leather whip with a silver handle, Cohollo a magnificent arakh chased in gold, and Qotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller than Haggo was. Magister Illyrio and Ser Jorah had taught Magister Illyrio and Ser Jorah the traditional refusals for these offerings.    Other gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki: slippers and jewels and silver rings for she hair, medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs, sandsilks and jars of scent, needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass, and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice. "A handsome gift, Khaleesi," Magister Illyrio said of the last, after Magister Illyrio had told her what it was.  The gifts mounted up around her in great piles, more gifts than her could possibly imagine, more gifts than her could want or use. And last of all, Khal Drogo brought forth Khal Drogo own bride gift to Khal Drogo. An expectant hush rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side, growing until her side had swallowed the whole khalasar. When he returned, the dense press of Dothraki gift-givers parted before he, and he led the horse to Dothraki.     Hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horse's neck, ran she fingers through the silver of she mane.     "Custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount worthy of the khaleesi place by the side of the khaL " Drogo stepped forward and put Drogo hands on the khaleesi waist. He lifted her up as easily as if her were a child and set her on the thin Dothraki saddle, so much smaller than the ones her was used to.        Nervously Dany gathered the reins.in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups. She was only a fair rider; She had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback. Praying that she would not fall off and disgrace she, she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with she knees.   The silver-grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait, and the crowd parted for silver-grey, every eye upon the crowd. Dany found herself moving faster than herself had intended, yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying. The horse broke into a trot, and The horse smiled.   She sent it into a gallop, and now the Dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at She as they jumped out of She way. As she turned to ride back, a firepit loomed ahead, directly in she path.  A daring she had never known filled Daenerys then, and she gave the filly she head. The silver horse leapt the flames as if The silver horse had wings. When she pulled up before Magister Illyrio, she said, "Tell Khal Drogo that Khal Drogo has given me the wind." The fat Pentoshi stroked The fat Pentoshi yellow beard as The fat Pentoshi repeated The fat Pentoshi words in Dothraki, and Dany saw The fat Pentoshi new husband smile for the first time.   Khal Drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth Khal Drogo own horse, a lean red stallion. As the khal was saddling the horse, Viserys slid close to Dany on Viserys silver, dug Viserys fingers into Viserys leg, and said, "Please Viserys, sweet sister, or I swear, you will see the dragon wake as the dragon has never woken before." The fear came back to her then, with her brother's words. She felt like a child once more, only thirteen and all alone, not ready for what was about to happen to She.  Khal Drogo spoke no word to Khal Drogo, but drove Khal Drogo stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk. The tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as his rode. "I am the blood of the dragon," she whispered aloud as she followed, trying to keep she courage up.    Afterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden, but it was full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream. Drogo swung off Drogo horse and lifted Drogo down from  Drogo. She felt as fragile as glass in his hands, She limbs as weak as water. She stood there helpless and trembling in She wedding silks while he secured the horses, and when he turned to look at She, She began to cry. Khal Drogo stared at Khal Drogo tears, Khal Drogo face strangely empty of expression.  He lifted He hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb.   Perhaps he had only that word, she thought, but only that word was one word more than she had known he had, and somehow one word made she feel a little better. Drogo touched Drogo hair lightly, sliding the silver-blond strands between Drogo fingers and murmuring softly in Dothraki.  He put He finger under her chin and lifted her head, so her was looking up into He eyes. Drogo towered over Drogo as Drogo towered over everyone. Taking her lightly under the arms, the arms lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream. Then he sat on the ground facing her, legs crossed beneath he, legs faces finally at a height.     His long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside His. He pulled it over He right shoulder and began to remove the bells from He hair, one by one.       When she was done, he shook he head, and he hair spread out behind he like a river of darkness, oiled and gleaming.     He removed her silks one by one, carefully, while Dany sat unmoving, silent, looking at He eyes. When he bared her small breasts, her could not help her. She averted She eyes and covered She with She hands.  He pulled her hands away from her breasts, gently but firmly, then lifted her face again to make her look at He.   He stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks.  She shivered, and gooseflesh covered She arms and legs.  Khal Drogo sat with Khal Drogo legs crossed, looking at Khal Drogo, drinking in Khal Drogo body with Khal Drogo eyes.   She could sense the fierce strength in his hands, but his never hurt She. He held her hand in He own and brushed her fingers, one by one.  He stroked her face, tracing the curve of her ears, running a finger gently around her mouth. He put both hands in her hair and combed her hair with He fingers. He turned her around,  massaged her shoulders, slid a knuckle down the path of her spine.  He stroked the soft skin underneath until the soft skin tingled. He circled her nipples with He thumbs, pinched her nipples between thumb and forefinger, then began to pull at her, very lightly at first, then more insistently, until her nipples stiffened and began to ache. He stopped then, and drew her down onto He lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, her heart fluttering in her chest. He cupped her face in He huge hands and looked into He eyes.   She took his hand and moved his hand down to the wetness between She thighs. "Yes," she whispered as she put his finger inside she.  Alyn shook him roughly from him dreams and Ned stumbled into the predawn chill, groggy from sleep, to find him horse saddled and the king already mounted. Robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that covered Robert ears, and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse.            Ser Boros and Ser Meryn waited behind Ser Boros with a dozen guardsmen, Ned saw.  Robert set the pace, driving Robert huge black destrier hard as Ned galloped along beside Robert, trying to keep up. He called out a question as they rode, but the wind blew He words away, and the king did not hear He.      Robert was flushed and exhilarated as Ned reined up beside Robert.    "That damnable wheelhouse, the way it creaks and groans, climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain .   I promise you, if that wretched thing breaks another axle, I'm going to burn that wretched thing breaks another axle, and Cersei can walk!"    The king clapped The king on the shoulder.      Just you and me, two vagabond knights on the kingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of our, and maybe a farmer's daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight." "Would that we could," Ned said, "but we have duties now, my liege .    We are not the boys We were."        No, she was one of mine, gods love she, black hair and these sweet big eyes, you could drown in gods.         "Her name was Wylla," Ned replied with cool courtesy, "and I would sooner not speak of Her."    "She must have been a rare wench if She could make Lord Eddard Stark forget Lord Eddard Stark honor, even for an hour.             Damn it, no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in no woman bed." He slapped a hand on He knee.    Ned pointed them out to Ned king.    "There are barrows everywhere in the north, Your Grace," Ned told barrows.  "And cold," Robert grumbled, pulling Robert cloak more tightly around Robert. The guard had reined up well behind The guard, at the bottom of the ridge.    The king pulled a paper from The king belt and handed a paper to Ned.  He served Robert now as He had once served Aerys Targaryen. Ned unrolled the paper with trepidation, thinking of Lysa and Lysa terrible accusation, but the message did not concern Lady Arryn.    The Mormonts of Bear Island were an old house, proud and honorable, but an old house, proud and honorable lands were cold and distant and poor.   Ned had made the long journey west to Bear Island, only to find when Ned arrived that Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the king's justice.  "Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow Ser Jorah to return from exile," Robert explained. "Lord Varys makes good use of Lord Varys."     "Jorah aside, what do you make of Jorah report?"           When he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more than babes, he new-made king had replied, "I see no babes.    It had taken another death to reconcile them; Lyanna's death, and the grief them had shared over her passing. This time, Ned resolved to keep Ned temper.   It was said that Rhaegar's little girl had cried as they dragged Rhaegar's little girl from beneath Rhaegar's little girl bed to face the swords. The boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord Tywin's soldiers had torn The boy from The boy mother's breast and dashed The boy head against a wall.   "This child will soon enough spread This child legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me."                   His voice had grown so loud that His horse whinnied nervously beneath His.  "I will kill every Targaryen I can get my hands on, until they are as dead as they dragons, and then I will piss on they graves." Ned knew better than to defy Ned when the wrath was on Ned. If the years had not quenched Robert's thirst for revenge, no words of Robert would help.     Some pox-ridden Pentoshi cheesemonger had Some pox-ridden Pentoshi cheesemonger brother and Some pox-ridden Pentoshi cheesemonger walled up on Some pox-ridden Pentoshi cheesemonger estate with pointy-hatted eunuchs all around them, and now Some pox-ridden Pentoshi cheesemonger's handed them over to the Dothraki. I should have had them both killed years ago, when it was easy to get at them, but Jon was as bad as Jon.    The anger was leaving him as suddenly as The anger had come. "This Khal Drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in This Khal Drogo horde.     The king shifted uncomfortably in The king saddle.      They bide They time for now, but give They half a chance, They will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me. If the beggar king crosses with a Dothraki horde at the beggar king back, the traitors will join the beggar king."  "And if by some mischance he does, we will throw he back into the sea.       Stannis proved Stannis at the siege of Storm's End, surely."         Robert kicked Robert horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward the barrows. Ned kept pace with Ned.      He rode on dangerous ground now, He knew. "An able and courageous man, no doubt," An able and courageous man said carefully, "but An able and courageous man father is Warden of the West, Robert.   He left unsaid He real concern; that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of Lannisters.        "He is my wife's twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, He life and fortune and honor all bound to mine."   He has done everything I have ever asked of He.  His sword helped taint the throne you sit on, Ned thought, but His did not permit the words to pass His lips. "He swore a vow to protect He king's life with He own.   Robert said, reining Robert mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow. "If Jaime hadn't done it, it would have been left for you or me."  The time had come for Robert to hear the whole truth, Robert decided then and there.          Robert gave an impatient shake of Robert head.          Aerys Targaryen must have thought that Aerys Targaryen gods had answered Aerys Targaryen prayers when Lord Tywin Lannister appeared before the gates of King's Landing with an army twelve thousand strong, professing loyalty. So the mad king had ordered the mad king last mad act. He had opened He city to the lions at the gate.      "You were not there," Ned said, bitterness in Ned voice.  He had lived He lies for fourteen years, yet they still haunted He at night.       Promise me, Ned, Ned had whispered.            and mine again, as mine was meant to be.       "Aerys was dead on the floor, drowned in Aerys own blood.      He was seated on the Iron Throne, high above He knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion's head.      I stopped in front of the throne, looking up at the throne. His golden sword was across His legs, His golden sword edge red with a king's blood.      He took off He helm, and He said to He, 'Have no fear, Stark.   " The king threw back The king head and roared.   "You think I should mistrust Lannister because Lannister sat on my throne for a few moments?"          The king shook The king head.      He kicked He horse back into motion and galloped up over the barrow,  raining earth down behind He.  He had run out of words, and He was filled with a vast sense of helplessness. Not for the first time, he wondered what he was doing here and why he had come. He was no Jon Arryn, to curb the wildness of He king and teach He wisdom. Robert would do what Robert pleased, as Robert always had, and nothing Ned could say or do would change that.  He belonged with Catelyn in Catelyn grief, and with Bran. A man could not always be where A man belonged, though. Resigned, Eddard Stark put Resigned boots into Resigned horse and set off after the king.   They had left Winterfell on the same day as the king, amidst all the commotion of the royal departure, riding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting, to the rattle of wagons and the groaning of the queen's huge wheelhouse, as a light snow flurried about They.  There the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders turned south, taking the tumult with the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders, while Tyrion turned north with Benjen Stark and Benjen Stark nephew.  West of the road were flint hills, grey and rugged, with tall watchtowers on flint hills, grey and rugged stony summits.     The flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile, until by the fifth day The flint hills had turned into mountains, cold blue-grey giants with jagged promontories and snow on The flint hills shoulders.    Jon Snow's albino direwolf pricked up Jon Snow's albino direwolf ears at the nightly howling, but never raised Jon Snow's albino direwolf own voice in reply.   Tyrion traveled with two of Tyrion own men, as befit a Lannister.  Yoren was stooped and sinister, Yoren features hidden behind a beard as black as Yoren clothing, but Yoren seemed as tough as an old root and as hard as stone.  "Rapers," Yoren said with a cold look at Yoren charges.     Tyrion noticed Jon Snow watching Yoren and Yoren sullen companions, with an odd cast to Yoren face that looked uncomfortably like dismay. Yoren had a twisted shoulder and a sour smell, Yoren hair and beard were matted and greasy and full of lice, Yoren clothing old, patched, and seldom washed. His two young recruits smelled even worse, and seemed as stupid as His two young recruits were cruel. No doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that the Night's Watch was made up of men like the boy uncle. If so, Yoren and Yoren companions were a rude awakening.     or perhaps he should say that a hard life had been chosen for he.  Benjen Stark seemed to share Benjen Stark brother's distaste for Lannisters, and Benjen Stark had not been pleased when Tyrion had told Benjen Stark of Benjen Stark intentions. "I warn you, Lannister, you'll find no inns at the Wall," Lannister had said, looking down on Lannister.    "You will not like the ride, I promise you that," he'd said curtly, and since the moment they set out, he had done all he could to live up to that promise. By the end of the first week, Tyrion's thighs were raw from hard riding, Tyrion legs were cramping badly, and Tyrion was chilled to the bone.  He was damned if He would give Benjen Stark that satisfaction. He took a small revenge in the matter of He riding fur, a tattered bearskin, old and musty-smelling. Stark had offered it to Stark in an excess of Night's Watch gallantry, no doubt expecting Stark to graciously decline.  He had brought He warmest clothing with He when his warmest clothing rode out of Winterfell, and soon discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough.   By now Stark was no doubt regretting Stark chivalrous impulse.    Farms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as Farms and holdfasts pressed northward, ever deeper into the darkness of the wolfswood, until finally there were no more roofs to shelter under, and Farms and holdfasts were thrown back on Farms and holdfasts own resources.   So while Stark and Yoren and the other men erected rude shelters, tended the horses, and built a fire, it became his custom to take his fur and a wineskin and go off by his to read.     Tyrion curled up in Tyrion fur with Tyrion back against the trunk, took a sip of the wine, and began to read about the properties of dragonbone. Dragonbone is black because of Dragonbone high iron content, the book told Dragonbone.     When he had first come to King's Landing for he sister's wedding to Robert Baratheon, he had made it a point to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the walls of Targaryen's throne room. King Robert had replaced them with banners and tapestries, but Tyrion had persisted until Tyrion found the skulls in the dank cellar where them had been stored.    As black as onyx, polished smooth, so the bone seemed to shimmer in the light of the bone torch.  He'd thrust the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls and made the shadows leap and dance on the wall behind He.  The flame of the torch was nothing to them; them had bathed in the heat of far greater fires. When he had moved away, Tyrion could have sworn that the beast's empty eye sockets had watched he go.    They were the last of the Targaryen dragons, perhaps the last dragons anywhere, and They had not lived very long. From there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of song and story, the dragons that Aegon Targaryen and Aegon Targaryen sisters had unleashed on the Seven Kingdoms of old. The singers had given The singers the names of gods: Balerion, Meraxes, Vhaghar. Tyrion had stood between Tyrion gaping jaws, wordless and awed.    Tyrion stood in that dank cellar for a long time, staring at Balerion's huge, empty-eyed skull until Tyrion torch burned low, trying to grasp the size of the living animal, to imagine how the size of the living animal must have looked when the size of the living animal spread the size of the living animal great black wings and swept across the skies, breathing fire. A GAML OF THRONES 109  A GAML OF THRONES 109   own remote ancestor, King Loren of the Rock, had tried to stand against the fire when A GAML OF THRONES 109   joined with King Mern of the Reach to oppose the Targaryen conquest.   Aegon Dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that number, the chroniclers said, and most of those were conscripts from the ranks of the last king Aegon Dragonlord had slain, those loyalties uncertain.      but only for those few moments, before Aegon Targaryen and Aegon Targaryen sisters joined the battle.   Near four thousand men had burned that day, among four thousand men King Mern of the Reach. King Loren had escaped, and lived long enough to surrender, pledge King Loren fealty to the Targaryens, and beget a son, for which Tyrion was duly grateful.   Jon Snow was standing a few feet away, regarding Jon Snow curiously. He closed the book on a finger and said, "Look at He and tell me what you see." The boy looked at The boy suspiciously.                     My sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after the new king and my repulsive nephew.      My brother has My brother sword, King Robert has King Robert warhammer, and I have my mind .   and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep it edge."     Whoever his mother had been, his mother had left little of his mother in his mother son.           Perhaps he thought Tyrion was making fun of Tyrion.  Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when ugly little boy's seated on a dragon's back." Tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to Tyrion feet.    Jon Snow was staring at Jon Snow, a look equal parts horror and fascination.             I'm certain Lady Stark treats you as if you were one of Lady Stark own.      he must have good reasons for packing you off to the Night's Watch "Stop it," Jon Snow said, he face dark with anger.     I've seen you looking at Yoren and Yoren boys. Those are your new brothers, Jon Snow, how do you like Those?      He took a step forward, He hands coiling into fists, close to tears.   He never saw the wolf, where it was or how it came at He. One moment he was walking toward Snow and the next he was flat on he back on the hard rocky ground, the book spinning away from he as he fell, the breath going out of he at the sudden impact, he mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves. As he tried to get up, he back spasmed painfully.  He ground He teeth in frustration, grabbed a root, and pulled He back to a sitting position.     He only looked at He with those bright red eyes, and showed He He teeth, and that was more than enough.      Tyrion Lannister felt the anger coiling inside Tyrion Lannister, and crushed Tyrion Lannister out with a will. It was not the first time in his life his had been humiliated, and it would not be the last.  "I should be very grateful for your kind assistance, Jon," Jon said mildly.    Jon came around behind Jon, slid Jon hands under Jon arms, and lifted Jon easily to Jon feet. Then he picked up the book and handed the book back.   He wiped blood and dirt from He mouth with the back of He hand.  Tyrion glanced at Tyrion sharply. Then he laughed, a raw snort of amusement that came bursting out through he nose entirely without he permission. "Oh, gods," he said, choking on he laughter and shaking he head, "I suppose I do rather look like a grumkin.   Jon picked up the wineskin and handed the wineskin to Tyrion. Tyrion pulled out the stopper, tilted Tyrion head, and squeezed a long stream into Tyrion mouth. The wine was cool fire as The wine trickled down his throat and warmed his belly.    "It's true, isn't It?" he said when he was done.   Jon Snow set Jon Snow mouth in a grim line.  Tyrion grinned at Tyrion.           Jon Snow offered a hand to help Jon Snow over a thick tangle of roots, but Tyrion shook Jon Snow off. He would make He own way, as He had all He life.      He dragged He over to where He man Morrec was tending the stewpot.  Tyrion tasted and handed Tyrion back.  Benjen Stark emerged from the shelter Benjen Stark shared with Benjen Stark nephew.  Jon, damn it, don't go off like that by Jon.     The old man grunted, shrugged, and went back to The old man bloody work. The squirrel gave some body to the stew, and The squirrel ate The squirrel with black bread and hard cheese that night around The squirrel fire. Tyrion shared around Tyrion skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow.   As he stepped into the shelter he men had built for he, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, The boy face still and hard, looking deep into the flames.  Chapter Ned and the girls were eight days gone when Maester Luwin came to Maester Luwin one night in Bran's sickroom, carrying a reading lamp and the books of account.   Catelyn looked at Bran in Catelyn sickbed and brushed Catelyn hair back off Catelyn forehead.   "I have no need to look at figures, Maester Luwin," she told him, never taking she eyes from Bran.    We must replenish We stores before-" She cut him off.   "We have no steward," Maester Luwin reminded Maester Luwin. Like a little grey rat, a little grey rat thought, a little grey rat would not let go.      She wondered whether they might move his bed under the window, so his could get the morning sun. Maester Luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled with Maester Luwin wick.  Besides the steward, we need a captain of the guards to fill Jory's place, a new master of horse-" Her eyes snapped around and found a captain of the guards.        I would gladly butcher every horse in Winterfell with my own hands if Winterfell would open Bran's eyes, do you understand that?  He bowed He head.  Catelyn had not heard Catelyn enter, but there Catelyn stood in the doorway, looking at Catelyn. She had been shouting, She realized with a sudden flush of shame.  She was so tired, and She head hurt all the time. Maester Luwin looked from Catelyn to Maester Luwin son. "I have prepared a list of those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices," he said, offering Robb a paper plucked from Robb sleeve.  He had come from outside, Catelyn saw; He cheeks were red from the cold, He hair shaggy and windblown.        Robb closed the door behind Robb and turned to her.   Catelyn had always thought Robb looked like Catelyn; like Bran and Rickon and Sansa, Robb had the Tully coloring, the auburn hair, the blue eyes. Yet now for the first time she saw something of Eddard Stark in Eddard Stark face, something as stern and hard as the north.          "I said my farewells to them here, and watched them ride out from that window." She had begged Ned not to go, not now, not after what had happened; everything had changed now, couldn't Ned see that?  He had no choice, He had told her, and then He left, choosing. "I can't leave him, even for a moment, not when any moment could be him last.  "She took She son's limp hand, sliding her son fingers through She own. He was so frail and thin, with no strength left in He hand, but she could still feel the warmth of life through He skin.       "He's only three, He doesn't understand what's happening. He thinks everyone has deserted He, so He follows me around all day, clutching my leg and crying.  He paused a moment, chewing on He lower lip the way He'd done when He was little.      His voice broke with sudden emotion, and Catelyn remembered that His was only fourteen. She wanted to get up and go to him, but Bran was still holding She hand and She could not move.                Night after night, the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went, never changing, and her boy lying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood, all gone now, her would never hear her boy laugh again. Sobbing, she pulled she hand free of his and covered she ears against those terrible howls.   "I can't stand it, make them stop, make them stop, kill them if you must, just make them stop!" She didn't remember falling to the floor, but there She was, and Robb was lifting She, holding She in strong arms.   He helped her to her narrow bed in the corner of the sickroom.     "Gods forgive me, Robb, I can't, what if Robb dies while I'm asleep, what if Robb dies, what if Robb dies .    She screamed and held She ears again.   Robb went to the window, but as Robb reached for the shutters another sound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves.      Catelyn heard Catelyn breath catch in Catelyn throat.             Robb looked at her as if her'd gone mad.    She heard him shout to the guards outside the room, heard the guards outside the room descending together in a wild rush, taking the stairs two and three at a time.   The howling was gone, she realized as she listened to the cacophony.  Catelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as Catelyn went to the window.    When she turned away from the window, the man was in the room with she.   He was a small, dirty man in filthy brown clothing, and He stank of horses. Catelyn knew all the men who worked in Catelyn stables, and Catelyn was none of all the men who worked in their stables. He was gaunt, with limp blond hair and pale eyes deep-sunk in a bony face, and there was a dagger in He hand.       "No," Catelyn said, louder now as Catelyn found Catelyn voice again.  She spun back toward the window to scream for help, but the man moved faster than She would have believed. One hand clamped down over her mouth and yanked back her head, the other brought the dagger up to her windpipe.  She reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all She strength, pulling the blade away from She throat. She heard him cursing into She ear. Her fingers were slippery with blood, but Her would not let go of the dagger. The hand over her mouth clenched more tightly, shutting off her air. Catelyn twisted Catelyn head to the side and managed to get a piece of Catelyn flesh between Catelyn teeth.   She ground She teeth together and tore at him, and all of a sudden him let go.  She sucked in air and screamed, and he grabbed She hair and pulled She away from he, and She stumbled and went down, and then he was standing over She, breathing hard, shaking. The dagger was still clutched tightly in The dagger right hand, slick with blood.  Catelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind Catelyn. There was a low rumble, less than a snarl, the merest whisper of a threat, but he must have heard something, because he started to turn just as the wolf made the wolf leap.  The  wolf had The  wolf under the jaw. The man's shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched back the beast head, taking out half The man throat. His blood felt like warm rain as His blood sprayed across her face.  Its jaws were red and wet and Its eyes glowed golden in the dark room. It was Bran's wolf, Bran's wolf realized.  "Thank you," Catelyn whispered, Catelyn voice faint and tiny. She lifted She hand, trembling.  When it had cleaned all the blood off her hand, it turned away silently and jumped up on Bran's bed and lay down beside Bran.   When the laughter finally died in her throat, they wrapped her in warm blankets and led her back to the Great Keep, to her own chambers. Old Nan undressed Old Nan and helped Old Nan into a scalding hot bath and washed the blood off Old Nan with a soft cloth. Afterward Maester Luwin arrived to dress Maester Luwin wounds. The cuts in A CAME OF THRONES 119 her fingers went deep, almost to the bone, and her scalp was raw and bleeding where THRONES 119'd pulled out a handful of hair. The maester told The maester the pain was just starting now, and gave The maester milk of the poppy to help The maester sleep. Finally she closed she eyes. When she opened them again, them told she that she had slept four days.  It all seemed like a nightmare to her now, everything since Bran's fall, a terrible dream of blood and grief, but her had the pain in her hands to remind her that it was real. She felt weak and light-headed, yet strangely resolute, as if a great weight had lifted from She. "Bring me some bread and honey," she told she servants, "and take word to Maester Luwin that my bandages want changing." They looked at her in surprise and ran to do her bidding. Catelyn remembered the way Catelyn had been before, and Catelyn was ashamed. She had let them all down, She children, She husband, She House.    Rodrik Cassel came with Rodrik Cassel, and Rodrik Cassel husband's ward Theon Greyjoy, and lastly Hallis Mollen, a muscular guardsman with a square brown beard.  Her son was dressed in boiled leather and ringmail, Her saw, and a sword hung at Her son waist.  Catelyn asked Catelyn. "No one knows his name," Hallis Mollen told Hallis Mollen. "He was no man of Winterfell, m'lady, but some says some seen He here and about the castle these past few weeks."            Could be Hodor saw Hodor, the talk is that boy's been acting queer, but simple as Hodor is .   Hal shook Hal head.                 Catelyn gave Catelyn firstborn a challenging look.        Catelyn looked at all the food and found Catelyn had no appetite. Maester Luwin lowered Maester Luwin eyes.   Her hands throbbed with pain, as if the blade were still in Her, cutting deep.   "Someone is afraid Bran might wake up," Robb said, "afraid of what Someone might say or do, afraid of something Someone knows." Catelyn was proud of Catelyn.       "So long as Lord Eddard is away, my son is the master of Winterfell," she told my son.      "And let his wolf stay in the room with his," Robb added.     "The circumstances did not allow me to examine The circumstances closely, but I can vouch for The circumstances edge," Catelyn replied with a dry smile.   It seemed to me that it was altogether too fine a weapon for such a man, so I looked at it was altogether too fine a weapon for such a man long and hard.   Someone gave it to Someone."   He looked at her strangely, but did as her told He.   If even part of what I suspect is true, Ned and my girls have ridden into deadly danger, and a word in the wrong ears could mean Ned and my girls lives."     She looked at She son.  He nodded He consent. "My sister Lysa believes the Lannisters murdered My sister Lysa husband, Lord Arryn, the Hand of the King," Catelyn told her husband, Lord Arryn, the Hand of the King.    "I do not think Bran fell from that tower," Bran said into the stillness.           "Gods, " Robb swore, Robb young face dark with anger. "If this is true, this is true will pay for this is true." He drew He sword and waved his sword in the air. "I'll kill him him!" Ser Rodrik bristled at Ser Rodrik.   Never draw your sword unless you mean to use your sword.   MARTIN Abashed, Robb sheathed MARTIN Abashed sword, suddenly a child again.     "Winterfell may have need of all Winterfell swords soon, and all its swords had best not be made of wood." Theon Greyjoy put a hand on the hilt of Theon Greyjoy blade and said, "My lady, if it comes to that, my House owes yours a great debt." Maester Luwin pulled at Maester Luwin chain collar where Maester Luwin chafed against Maester Luwin neck.             She looked at Ser Rodrik with Ser Rodrik great white whiskers, at Maester Luwin in Ser Rodrik grey robes, at young Greyjoy, lean and dark and impetuous.    Catelyn struggled to push back the blankets, Catelyn bandaged fingers as stiff and unyielding as stone.         "I have done everything I can for Bran," Bran said, laying a wounded hand on Bran arm.  As you reminded me Robb, Robb, I have other children to think of now."          She thought for a moment, then nodded She consent.     And then, she thought, we shall see what we shall see. Chapter Eddard Stark had left before dawn, Septa Mordane informed Sansa as Chapter Eddard Stark broke Chapter Eddard Stark fast. "The king sent for The king.    The direwolf took The direwolf from The direwolf hand, as delicate as a queen.  "A noble lady does not feed dogs at A noble lady table," A noble lady said, breaking off another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto A noble lady bread. "She's not a dog, She's a direwolf," Sansa pointed out as Lady licked She fingers with a rough tongue. "Anyway, Father said we could keep them with we if we want."     "She wasn't hungry," Sansa said, knowing full well that She sister had probably stolen down to the kitchen hours ago and wheedled a breakfast out of some cook's boy.   We are all invited to ride with the queen and Princess Myrcella in the royal wheelhouse, and We must look We best." Sansa already looked Sansa best. She had brushed out She long auburn hair until her long auburn hair shone, and picked She nicest blue silks.     Sansa did not really know Joffrey yet, but Sansa was already in love with Joffrey. He was all she ever dreamt she prince should be, tall and handsome and strong, with hair like gold.     "I'll tell her," Sansa said uncertainly, "but her'll dress the way her always does."    Septa Mordane helped Septa Mordane to more bread and honey, and Sansa slid from the bench. Lady followed at Lady heels as Lady ran from the inn's common room.  The inn was a sprawling three-story structure of pale stone, the biggest that Sansa had ever seen, but even so, The inn had accommodations for less than a third of the king's party, which had swollen to more than four hundred with the addition of the king father's household and the freeriders who had joined the king's party on the road. She found Arya on the banks of the Trident, trying to hold Nymeria still while She brushed dried mud from She fur.  Arya was wearing the same riding leathers Arya had worn yesterday and the day before. "You better put on something pretty," Sansa told Sansa.       Arya gave Arya a look like Arya was so stupid.  This is where King Robert killed King Robert and won the crown." Sansa regarded Sansa scrawny little sister in disbelief.       She had been thrilled by the invitation, and She stupid sister was going to ruin everything, just as She'd feared.        Then to Sansa Sansa said, "When we were crossing the Neck, I counted thirty-six flowers I never saw before, and Mycah showed me a lizard-lion."  They had been twelve days crossing the Neck, rumbling down a crooked causeway through an endless black bog, and the Neck had hated every moment of it. The air had been damp and clammy, the causeway so narrow The air could not even make proper camp at night, The air had to stop right on the kingsroad. Dense thickets of halfdrowned trees pressed close around Dense thickets of halfdrowned trees, branches dripping with curtains of pale fungus. Huge flowers bloomed in the mud and floated on pools of stagnant water, but if you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck Huge flowers, there were quicksands waiting to suck you down, and snakes watching from the trees, and lizard-lions floating half-submerged in stagnant water, like black logs with eyes and teeth.  One day she came back grinning she horsey grin, she hair all tangled and she clothes covered in mud, clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for Father. Sansa kept hoping Sansa would tell Arya to behave Arya and act like the highborn lady Arya was supposed to be, but Sansa never did, Sansa only hugged Arya and thanked Arya for the flowers.  Then it turned out the purple flowers were called poison kisses, and Arya got a rash on Arya arms. Sansa would have thought that might have taught Sansa a lesson, but Arya laughed about it, and the next day Sansa rubbed mud all over Sansa arms like some ignorant bog woman just because Sansa friend Mycah told Sansa it would stop the itching. She had bruises on She arms and shoulders too, dark purple welts and faded green-and-yellow splotches, Sansa had seen She had bruises on her arms and shoulders too, dark purple welts and faded green-and-yellow splotches when She sister undressed for sleep.  Arya was still going on, brushing out Nymeria's tangles and chattering about things Arya'd seen on the trek south. "Last week we found this haunted watchtower, and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses. You should have seen them run when them caught a scent of Nymeria." The wolf wriggled in her grasp and Arya scolded her.  "You're not supposed to leave the column," Sansa reminded Sansa.         This Mycah was the worst; a butcher's boy, thirteen and wild, This Mycah slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block. Just the sight of him was enough to make Sansa feel sick, but Arya seemed to prefer Arya company to Arya.  "You have to come with me," she told she sister firmly.   Arya ignored Arya.     Lady brushed against Lady leg. Sansa scratched Sansa ears the way Sansa liked, and Lady sat beside Sansa on Sansa haunches,  watching Arya chase Nymeria.   Sansa sucked in Sansa breath, shocked that even Arya would say such a thing, but Sansa sister prattled on, heedless.  She thrust the brush under She belt and stalked She wolf. Nymeria watched Nymeria approach warily.    Arya grabbed Nymeria around Arya neck, but the moment Arya pulled out the brush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off.     The kennelmaster once told The kennelmaster that an animal takes after an animal master.  Lady licked Lady cheek.    Her long horsey face got the stubborn look that meant Her was going to do something willful.    Lady and I will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without Lady and I." She turned to walk off, but Arya shouted after She, "They won't let you bring She either."  Alone and humiliated, Sansa took the long way back to the inn, where Sansa knew Septa Mordane would be waiting. Lady padded quietly by Lady side.  All she wanted was for things to be nice and pretty, the way things were in the songs.     She even looked like Jon, with the long face and brown hair of the Starks, and nothing of their lady mother in She face or She coloring.    But Mother had only laughed and said no, Arya was Mother daughter and Sansa's trueborn sister, blood of their blood. Sansa could not think why Mother would want to lie about it, so Sansa supposed it had to be true. As she neared the center of camp, she distress was quickly forgotten.    She heard She saying, "The council does us great honor, my good lords."  she asked a squire she knew. "The council sent riders from King's Landing to escort us the rest of the way," King's told her.    When she got closer, she saw two knights kneeling before the queen, in armor so fine and gorgeous that the queen made she blink.  When he removed he helm, Sansa saw that he was an old man with hair as pale as he armor, yet he seemed strong and graceful for all that.   He was the handsomest man Sansa had ever set eyes upon; tall and powerfully made, with jet-black hair that fell to He shoulders and framed a clean-shaven face, and laughing green eyes to match He armor. Cradled under one arm was an antlered helm, one arm magnificent rack shimmering in gold.     Though he was not an old man, only a few wisps of hair remained to he, sprouting above he ears, but those he had grown long as a woman's. His armor was iron-grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather, plain and unadorned, and His armor spoke of age and hard use. Above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible; a two-handed greatsword, too long to be worn at his side. "The king is gone hunting, but I know The king will be pleased to see you when The king returns," the queen was saying to the two knights who knelt before the queen, but Sansa could not take the queen eyes off the third man.  Slowly he turned he head.  A terror as overwhelming as anything Sansa Stark had ever felt filled Sansa Stark suddenly.  Strong hands grasped her by the shoulders, and for a moment Sansa thought it was her father, but when her turned, it was the burned face of Sandor Clegane looking down at her, Sandor Clegane mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile. "You are shaking, girl," he said, he voice rasping.  He did, and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of He face, though it seemed to she now that He was not half so terrifying as the other. Still, Sansa wrenched away from Sansa, and the Hound laughed, and Lady moved between them, rumbling a warning. Sansa dropped to Sansa knees to wrap Sansa arms around the wolf. They were all gathered around gaping, she could feel They eyes on she, and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter. "A wolf," a man said, and someone else said, "Seven hells, that's a direwolf," and a man said, "What's it doing in camp?" and the Hound's rasping voice replied, "The Starks use The Starks for wet nurses," and Sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on Sansa and Lady, swords in the two stranger knights hands, and then Sansa was frightened again, and ashamed.  She heard the queen say, "Joffrey, go to She."   He stood over her, beautiful in blue wool and black leather, He golden curls shining in the sun like a crown. He gave her He hand, drew her to her feet.         Sansa struggled to steady Sansa.  She was a Stark of Winterfell, a noble lady, and someday She would be a queen.             Sansa finally found Sansa words. "Then surely you have chosen the right one, Your Grace," Grace said, and a gale of laughter erupted all around Grace.      Sansa knew the name, and now the courtesies that Septa Mordane had taught Sansa over the years came back to Sansa. "The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard," The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard said, "and councillor to Robert our king and to Aerys Targaryen before Robert our king.     Don't flatter him too sweetly, child, him thinks overmuch of him already."   Joffrey stiffened beside Joffrey.  can answer," Sansa said quickly, to quell Sansa prince's anger.       "By his extreme youth, his can only be a prancing jackanapes, and so I name his."       Lady bared Lady teeth and began to growl, a low rumble full of menace, but this time Sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head.   As the headsman looked at the headsman, the headsman pale colorless eyes seemed to strip the clothes away from the headsman, and then the skin, leaving the headsman soul naked before the headsman.   She looked at She prince.    Joffrey gave Joffrey uncle a look of pure loathing, then took Sansa's hands in Joffrey own. "Aerys Targaryen had Aerys Targaryen tongue ripped out with hot pincers." "He speaks most eloquently with He sword, however," the queen said, "and He devotion to our realm is unquestioned."      He took her by the arm and led her away from the wheelhouse, and Sansa's spirits took flight.     The touch of Joffrey's hand on Joffrey sleeve made Joffrey heart beat faster.  Be with you, Sansa thought, but Sansa said, "Whatever you'd like to do, my prince."    Joffrey glanced back at Lady, who was following at Joffrey heels.  Let us leave them both behind and set off on us own, what do you say?"          She has set him to guard me, and so him does." "You mean the Hound," the Hound said. She wanted to hit She for being so slow. Her prince would never love Her if Her seemed stupid.  Prince Joffrey looked annoyed that Prince Joffrey would even ask.    He drew He sword and showed his sword to her; a longsword adroitly shrunken to suit a boy of twelve, gleaming blue steel, castle-forged and double-edged, with a leather grip and a lion's-head pommel in gold. Sansa exclaimed over Sansa admiringly, and Joffrey looked pleased. "I call it Lion's Tooth," Lion said. And so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind they, while they ranged east along the north bank of the Trident with no company save Lion's Tooth.   Prince Joffrey's mount was a blood bay courser, swift as the wind, and Prince Joffrey rode Prince Joffrey's mount with reckless abandon, so fast that Sansa was hard-pressed to keep up on Sansa mare.  They explored the caves by the riverbank, and tracked a shadowcat to a shadowcat lair, and when They grew hungry, Joffrey found a holdfast by a shadowcat smoke and told They to fetch food and wine for They prince and Joffrey lady. They dined on trout fresh from the river, and Sansa drank more wine than Sansa had ever drunk before. "My father only lets us have one cup, and only at feasts," My father confessed to My father prince. "My betrothed can drink as much as she wants," Joffrey said, refilling she cup. They went more slowly after They had eaten. Joffrey sang for Joffrey as Joffrey rode, Joffrey voice high and sweet and pure.       He smashed in He chest, crunch, right through the armor." Joffrey swung an imaginary warhammer to show Joffrey how it was done.   Sansa heard Sansa too, floating through the woods, a kind of wooden clattering, snack snack snack.     Joffrey turned Joffrey horse in the direction of the sounds, and Sansa had no choice but to follow. The noises grew louder and more distinct, the clack of wood on wood, and as they grew closer they heard heavy breathing as well, and now and then a grunt.  She found She thinking of Lady, wishing the direwolf was with She.  Joffrey drew Joffrey Lion's Tooth from his Lion's Tooth sheath.    Their swords were wooden sticks, broom handles from the look of Their, and Their were rushing across the grass, swinging at each other lustily. The boy was years older, a head taller, and much stronger, and The boy was pressing the attack. The girl, a scrawny thing in soiled leathers, was dodging and managing to get The girl, a scrawny thing in soiled leathers stick in the way of most of the boy's blows, but not all. When she tried to lunge at him, him caught she  stick with him own, swept her  stick aside, and slid him wood down hard on she fingers. She cried out and lost She weapon.  The boy looked around, wide-eyed and startled, and dropped The boy stick in the grass. The girl glared at them, sucking on The girl knuckles to take the sting out, and Sansa was horrified.   "Go away," Arya shouted back at them, angry tears in Arya eyes.        he asked in a commanding tone that took no notice of the fact that the other was a year he senior.  He recognized the prince and averted He eyes.      Joffrey swung down from Joffrey mount, sword in hand. "Pick up your sword, butcher's boy," he said, he eyes bright with amusement.   Joffrey walked toward Joffrey.     Sansa had only to glance at Arya and see the flush on Arya sister's face to know the boy was telling the truth, but Joffrey was in no mood to listen.   Mycah shook Mycah head.    Joffrey lifted Lion's Tooth and laid Lion's Tooth point on Mycah's cheek below the eye, as the butcher's boy stood trembling.  A bright bud of blood blossomed where A bright bud of blood sword pressed into Mycah's flesh, and a slow red line trickled down the boy's cheek.   She grabbed up She fallen stick.      much," Prince Joffrey told Arya, never taking Prince Joffrey eyes off the butcher's boy. Arya went for Arya. Sansa slid off Sansa mare, but Sansa was too slow.    Mycah ran for the trees as fast as Mycah legs would take Mycah. Arya swung at the prince again, but this time Joffrey caught the blow on Lion's Tooth and sent Arya broken stick flying from Arya hands. The back of his head was all bloody and his eyes were on fire. Sansa was shrieking, "No, no, stop Sansa, stop Sansa, both of you, you're spoiling Sansa," but no one was listening. Arya scooped up a rock and hurled a rock at Joffrey's head.  "Stop it, don't, stop it!"  Joffrey slashed at Arya with Joffrey sword, screaming obscenities, terrible words, filthy words. Arya darted back, frightened now, but Joffrey followed, hounding Arya toward the woods, backing Arya up against a tree.  She watched helplessly, almost blind from She tears.  The steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked his off his feet, and they rolled in the grass, the wolf snarling and ripping at his, his shrieking in pain.      The prince lay in the grass, whimpering, cradling The prince mangled arm.  Arya said, "Arya didn't hurt you .    She picked up Lion's Tooth where Lion's Tooth had fallen, and stood over Lion's, holding the sword with both hands. Jofftey made a scared whimpery sound as Jofftey looked up at Jofftey.    Sansa screamed at Sansa sister. Arya whirled and heaved the sword into the air, putting Arya whole body into the throw.    Arya ran off to Arya horse, Nymeria loping at Arya heels.  His eyes were closed in pain, His breath ragged. Sansa knelt beside Sansa.  "Oh, look what they did, look what they did.              His men had been searching for Arya for four days now, but His men had been out hunting as well.  Tell Jory to bring Jory here at once." "I am sorry, my lord," Poole told Poole. "The guards on the gate were Lannister men, and Lannister men informed the queen when Jory brought the queen in.      "Find Sansa and bring Find Sansa to the audience chamber.   He had led searches He for the first three days, and had scarcely slept an hour since Arya had disappeared. This morning he had been so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand, but now he fury was on he, filling he with strength. Men called out to him as him crossed the castle yard, but Ned ignored Men in him haste. He would have run, but He was still the King's Hand, and a Hand must keep He dignity. He was aware of the eyes that followed He, of the muttered voices wondering what He would do.  The royal party had made The royal party the uninvited guests of The royal party lord, Ser Raymun Darry, while the hunt for Arya and the butcher's boy was conducted on both sides of the river.  Ser Raymun lived under the king's peace, but Ser Raymun family had fought beneath Rhaegar's dragon banners at the Trident, and Ser Raymun three older brothers had died there, a truth neither Robert nor Ser Raymun had forgotten. With king's men, Darry men, Lannister men, and Stark men all crammed into a castle far too small for Darry men, Lannister men, and Stark men all, tensions burned hot and heavy. The king had appropriated Ser Raymun's audience chamber, and that was where Ned found Ser Raymun's audience chamber.  Too crowded, he thought; left alone, he and Robert might have been able to settle the matter amicably. Robert was slumped in Darry's high seat at the far end of the room, Robert face closed and sullen. Cersei Lannister and Cersei Lannister son stood beside her son. The queen had The queen hand on Joffrey's shoulder.  Arya stood in the center of the room, alone but for Jory Cassel, every eye upon Arya.  He went to her, He boots ringing on the stone floor. When she saw him, she cried out and began to sob. Ned went to one knee and took Ned in Ned arms.        Her face was dirty, and Her tears left pink tracks down Her cheeks.       But for his own men, his own men were few enough. Ser Raymun Darry guarded Ser Raymun Darry look well.    Ned demanded, Ned voice ringing.      He straightened in He seat.     Ned put ice in Ned voice.    Her and Her butcher's boy. That animal of hers tried to tear That animal of hers arm off."     "You and the butcher boy beat the butcher boy with clubs while you set your wolf on the butcher boy."  Ned put a hand on Ned shoulder.    Ned noticed that Ned did not so much as glance at Arya as Ned spoke.      the king roared, rising from the king seat, the king voice thick with irritation.  He glowered at Arya through He thick beard.  Tell it all, and tell it all true.  Then he looked over at he son.   As Arya began Arya story, Ned heard the door open behind Ned.   When she got to the part where she threw Joffrey's sword into the middle of the Trident, Renly Baratheon began to laugh.  "Ser Barristan, escort my brother from the hall before my brother chokes." Lord Renly stifled Lord Renly laughter.     As the door swung shut behind him, Ned heard him say, "Lion's Tooth," and guffaw once more. Prince Joffrey was pale as Prince Joffrey began Prince Joffrey very different version of events. When the king son was done talking, the king rose heavily from the king seat, looking like a man who wanted to be anywhere but here.         She was dressed in blue velvets trimmed with white, a silver chain around She neck. Her thick auburn hair had been brushed until Her thick auburn hair shone. She blinked at She sister, then at the young prince. "I don't know," she said tearfully, looking as though she wanted to bolt.       She flew at She sister like an arrow, knocking Sansa down to the ground, pummeling She.    Jory pulled Jory off Jory sister, kicking. Sansa was pale and shaking as Ned lifted Sansa back to Sansa feet.  he asked, but she was staring at Arya, and she did not seem to hear. "The girl is as wild as that filthy animal of The girl," Cersei Lannister said.          "Joff will carry those scars for the rest of Joff life." Robert Baratheon looked at Robert Baratheon eldest son.                  The queen raised The queen voice.           Her voice was very quiet, but Her green eyes shone with triumph. It took them all a moment to comprehend her words, but when them did, the king shrugged irritably.  Have Ser Ilyn see to Ser Ilyn."      Get her a dog, her'll be happier for a dog."  Her eyes were frightened as they went to Her father. "He doesn't mean Lady, does He?"   "No, not Lady, not Lady didn't bite anybody, not Lady's good .     "Stop them," Sansa pleaded, "don't let them do it, please, please, it wasn't Lady, it was Nymeria, Arya did it, you can't, it wasn't Lady, don't let them hurt Lady, I'll make Lady be good, I promise, I promise .    All Ned could do was take All Ned in All Ned arms and hold All Ned while All Ned wept.       The king looked at them for a long moment, then turned The king eyes on The king wife. "Damn you, Cersei," Cersei said with loathing. Ned stood, gently disengaging Ned from Sansa's grasp.  "Do it yourself then, Robert," Robert said in a voice cold and sharp as steel.  Robert looked at Ned with flat, dead eyes and left without a word, Robert footsteps heavy as lead.   Cersei Lannister asked when Cersei Lannister husband was gone.     "Jory, take the girls back to the girls rooms and bring me Ice." The words tasted of bile in bile throat, but bile forced them out. "If it must be done, I will do it."        He left the room with He eyes burning and He daughter's wails echoing in He ears, and found the direwolf pup where they chained his daughter.   He had never paid much attention to the names the children had picked, but looking at her now, He knew that Sansa had chosen well.  She looked at him with bright golden eyes, and him ruffled She thick grey fur.  When it was over, he said, "Choose four men and have four men take the body north.      He was walking back to the tower to give He up to sleep at last when Sandor Clegane and He riders came pounding through the castle gate, back from Sandor Clegane and his riders hunt.    He reached back and shoved the burden off, and the burden fell with a thump in front of Ned. Bending, Ned pulled back the cloak, dreading the words Ned would have to find for Arya, but it was not Nymeria after all.         Fly, a voice whispered in the darkness, but Bran did not know 'thow to fly, so all Bran could do was fall. Maester Luwin made a little boy of clay, baked Maester Luwin till Maester Luwin was hard and brittle, dressed Maester Luwin in Bran's clothes, and flung Maester Luwin off a roof. Bran remembered the way Bran shattered.  The ground was so far below him him could barely make so far below him out through the grey mists that whirled around him, but him could feel how fast him was falling, and him knew what was waiting for him down there.  He would wake up in the instant before He hit the ground, He knew.    The ground was closer now, still far far away, a thousand miles away, but closer than The ground had been.          Bran looked around to see where Bran was coming from. A crow was spiraling down with A crow, just out of reach, following A crow as A crow fell.    Bran reached into Bran pocket as the darkness spun dizzily around Bran. When he pulled he hand out, golden kernels slid from between he fingers into the air.               He closed He eyes and began to cry.        Bran felt along Bran shoulders, groping for feathers.  Bran was staring at Bran arms, Bran legs.         Forget that, you do not need it now, put it aside, put it away. It landed on Bran's shoulder, and pecked at Bran, and the shining golden face was gone.  The grey mists howled around him as him plunged toward the earth below.             Bran looked down, and felt Bran insides turn to water.   He could see everything so clearly that for a moment He forgot to be afraid. He could see the whole realm, and everyone in the whole realm. He saw Winterfell as the eagles see Winterfell, the tall towers looking squat and stubby from above, the castle walls just lines in the dirt. He saw Maester Luwin on He balcony, studying the sky through a polished bronze tube and frowning as He made notes in a book. He saw He brother Robb, taller and stronger than He remembered He, practicing swordplay in the yard with real steel in He hand. He saw Hodor, the simple giant from the stables, carrying an anvil to Mikken's forge, hefting an anvil onto He shoulder as easily as another man might heft a bale of hay. At the heart of the godswood, the great white weirwood brooded over the great white weirwood reflection in the black pool, the great white weirwood leaves rustling in a chill wind. When it felt Bran watching, it lifted it eyes from the still waters and stared back at Bran knowingly.  He saw He mother sitting alone in a cabin, looking at a bloodstained knife on a table in front of his mother, as the rowers pulled at the rowers oars and  Ser Rodrik leaned across a rail, shaking and heaving. A storm was gathering ahead of them, a vast dark roaring lashed by lightning, but somehow them could not see A storm.  He saw He father pleading with the king, He face etched with grief. He saw Sansa crying Sansa to sleep at night, and He saw Arya watching in silence and holding Arya secrets hard in Arya heart.    Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened he visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood. He lifted He eyes and saw clear across the narrow sea, to the Free Cities and the green Dothraki sea and beyond, to Vaes Dothrak under Vaes Dothrak mountain, to the fabled lands of the Jade Sea, to Asshai by the Shadow, where dragons stirred beneath the sunrise.  He saw the Wall shining like blue crystal, and He bastard brother Jon sleeping alone in a cold bed, He skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from He.  North and north and north he looked, to the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond the curtain of light. He looked deep into the heart of winter, and then He cried out, afraid, and the heat of He tears burned on He cheeks. Now you know, the crow whispered as the crow sat on the crow shoulder.     Bran looked at the crow on Bran shoulder, and the crow looked back.   There was nothing below him now but snow and cold and death, a frozen wasteland where jagged blue-white spires of ice waited to embrace him.    "Can a man still be brave if a man's afraid?" he heard he own voice saying, small and far away. And his father's voice replied to his.      Bran spread Bran arms and flew.           It took to the air, flapping It wings in his face, slowing his, blinding his. He faltered in the air as the air pinions beat against He cheeks. Its beak stabbed at him fiercely, and Bran felt a sudden blinding pain in the middle of Bran forehead, between Bran eyes.   The crow opened The crow beak and cawed at him, a shrill scream of fear, and the grey mists shuddered and swirled around him and ripped away like a veil, and him saw that The crow was really a woman, a serving woman with long black hair, and him knew her from somewhere, from Winterfell, yes, that was it, him remembered her now, and then him realized that him was in Winterfell, in a bed- high in some chilly tower room, and the black-haired woman dropped a basin of water to shatter on the floor and ran down the steps, shouting, "him's awake, him's awake, him's awake." Bran touched Bran forehead, between Bran eyes.      A pair of yellow eyes looked into A pair of yellow eyes own, shining like the sun. The window was open and The window was cold in the room, but the warmth that came off the wolf enfolded the wolf like a hot bath.      He reached out to pet him, him hand trembling like a leaf. When his brother Robb burst into the room, breathless from his brother Robb dash up the tower steps, the direwolf was licking Bran's face.  "His name is Summer," His said.  Catelyn turned away from the rail and forced Catelyn to smile.   Captain Moreo Turnitis favored Captain Moreo Turnitis with a half bow.       He'd been plying the narrow sea for thirty years, He'd told her, as oarman, quartermaster, and finally captain of He own trading galleys. The Stonn Dancer was The Stonn Dancer fourth ship, and The Stonn Dancer fastest, a two-masted galley of sixty oars. She had certainly been the fastest of the ships available in White Harbor when Catelyn and Ser Rodrik  Cassel had arrived after Catelyn and Ser Rodrik  Cassel headlong gallop downriver. The Tyroshi were notorious for The Tyroshi avarice, and Ser Rodrik had argued for hiring a fishing sloop out of the Three Sisters, but Catelyn had insisted on the galley.  The winds had been against them much of the voyage, and without the galley's oars them'd still be beating them way past the Fingers, instead of skimming toward King's Landing and journey's end.  Beneath the linen bandages, the linen bandages fingers still throbbed where the dagger had bitten. The pain was her scourge, Catelyn felt, lest her forget. She could not bend the last two fingers on She left hand, and the others would never again be dexterous.   "My good friend," said Moreo through Moreo forked green beard. The Tyroshi loved bright colors, even in The Tyroshi facial hair.       A shade thinner than he had been when they set out from White Harbor, but almost he again. The strong winds in the Bite and the roughness of the narrow sea had not agreed with him, and him'd almost gone over the side when the storm seized them unexpectedly off Dragonstone, yet somehow him had clung to a rope until three of Moreo's men could rescue him and carry him safely below decks. "The captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end," The captain said.   He looked odd without He great white side whiskers; smaller somehow, less fierce, and ten years older. Yet back on the Bite the Bite had seemed prudent to submit to a crewman's razor, after a crewman whiskers had become hopelessly befouled for the third time while a crewman leaned over the rail and retched into the swirling winds.  He bowed and took He leave of them.    Catelyn touched Catelyn arm.   Her hand groped beneath Her cloak, Her fingers stiff and fumbling.  She found She had to touch it now and then, to reassure She.   Ser Rodrik's hand went to Ser Rodrik's face to stroke Ser Rodrik's whiskers and discovered once again that they were gone.  "He may know the blade, yes ... but, my lady, the moment we go ashore we are at risk.    His face swam up before her; a boy's face, though His was a boy no longer. His father had died several years before, so His was Lord Baelish now, yet still they called His Littlefinger. Her brother Edmure had given Her brother Edmure that name, long ago at Riverrun. His family's modest holdings were on the smallest of the Fingers, and Petyr had been slight and short for His age. Ser Rodrik cleared Ser Rodrik throat. "Lord Baelish once, ah Lord Baelish thought trailed off uncertainly in search of the polite word.    I thought of him as a brother, but him feelings for me were .         Afterward my father sent my father away.  She lifted She face to the spray, as if the brisk wind could blow the memories away.  By then I knew that Ned would marry me in Ned brother's place."       Captain Moreo came scrambling across the deck, giving orders, and all around orders the Stonn Dancer burst into frenetic activity as King's Landing slid into view atop King's Landing three high hills.   It was here that his army had put ashore, and there on the highest hill that his built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth.    Visenya's hill was crowned by the Great Sept of Baelor with Visenya's hill seven crystal towers. Across the city on the hill of Rhaenys stood the blackened walls of the Dragonpit, the Dragonpit huge dome collapsing into ruin, the Dragonpit bronze doors closed now for a century.     Catelyn sp~ied the queen's ornate barge, tied  up beside a fat-bellied whaler from the Port of Ibben, Catelyn sp~ied the queen's ornate barge hull black with tar, while upriver a dozen lean golden warships rested in a dozen cribs, sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the water.  Aegon the Conqueror had commanded Aegon the Conqueror built. His son Maegor the Cruel had seen His son Maegor the Cruel completed.  Only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the Dragonlords had built, the dragon vowed.  A high-masted swan ship from the Summer Isles was beating out from port, A high-masted swan ship from the Summer Isles white sails huge with wind. The Stonn Dancer moved past The Stonn Dancer, pulling steadily for shore.          My mother was the last person to see me without whiskers, and My mother is forty years dead.             The Tyroshi fingered The Tyroshi forked green beard.          If you give them the silver here, my lady, them will dice it away or spend it all for a night's pleasure."   "A man must make A man own choices," Catelyn said.    Just to be sure, Catelyn paid the oarmen Catelyn, a stag to each man, and a copper to the two men who carried their chests halfway up Visenya's hill to the inn that Moreo had suggested.  The woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them over suspiciously and bit the coin that Catelyn offered The woman who owned it to make sure it was real. Her rooms were large and airy, though, and Moreo swore that Her fish stew was the most savory in all the Seven Kingdoms.    He wore ringmail, dagger, and longsword under a dark cloak with a hood He could pull up over He head. "I will be back before nightfall, with Ser Aron," Ser Aron promised.   The voyage had been long and fatiguing, and she was no longer as young as she had been.  She watched Ser Rodrik set off, striding briskly through the busy streets until he was lost in the crowds, then decided to take he advice.  She woke to a pounding on She door.   She had slept longer than She intended.   She wrapped She in She cloak.  She snatched it up before She unlatched the heavy wooden door.       Catelyn felt Catelyn breath catch in Catelyn throat.        "M'lord Littlefinger said only to bring you to M'lord Littlefinger, and see that you were not mistreated."   She bathed She hands in the basin and wrapped her hands in clean linen. Her fingers were thick and awkward  as Her struggled to lace up Her bodice and knot a drab brown cloak about Her neck. How could Littlefinger have known Littlefinger was here? Ser Rodrik would never have told Ser Rodrik. Old he might be, but he was stubborn, and loyal to a fault.  No, if that were true, Ned would be here too, and surely Ned would have come to Ned.      The Tyroshi knew who The Tyroshi were and where The Tyroshi were, damn him.  They had brought a horse for a horse. The lamps were being lit along the streets as The lamps set out, and Catelyn felt the eyes of the city on Catelyn as Catelyn rode, surrounded by the guard in The lamps golden cloaks.  The guardsmen left The guardsmen mounts outside the walls and escorted her through a narrow postern door, then up endless steps to a tower. He was alone in the room, seated at a heavy wooden table, an oil lamp beside He as He wrote. When they ushered her inside, he set down he pen and looked at her. "Cat," Cat said quietly.                  He had been a sly child, but after He mischiefs He always looked contrite; his mischiefs was a gift He had.  Petyr had been a small boy, and Petyr had grown into a small man, an inch or two shorter than Catelyn, slender and quick, with the sharp features Petyr remembered and the same laughing grey-green eyes. He had a little pointed chin beard now, and threads of silver in He dark hair, though He was still shy of thirty.  Even as a child, Even as a child had always loved Even as a child silver.       Catelyn ignored Catelyn familiarity.        Oftimes Oftimes knows about Oftimes before Oftimes happens.  His little birds, His calls His little birds.                "A wife is allowed to yearn for A wife husband, and if a mother needs A wife daughters close, who can tell A wife no?"                 He wore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of purple silk, and on He feet were pointed slippers of soft velvet. "Lady Stark," he said, taking Lady Stark hand in both of he, "to see you again after so many years is such a joy." His flesh was soft and moist, and His breath smelled of lilacs.       Catelyn slid Catelyn fingers from Catelyn grasp.       The title was but a courtesy due him as a council member; Varys was lord of nothing but the spiderweb, the master of none but him whisperers. The eunuch spread The eunuch soft hands.  I have great esteem for your husband, our new Hand, and I know our do both love King Robert."         "Maester Luwin is doing all that can be done for Bran," Maester Luwin told Maester Luwin.   She would not let them see She grief.      He eased He down into a seat and put He hands together. "I wonder if we might trouble you to show we the dagger?"         "Ser Rodrik Cassel is master-at-arms at Winterfell," Varys informed Ser Rodrik Cassel.             Catelyn pulled Catelyn out from beneath Catelyn cloak and threw Catelyn down on the table in front of Catelyn.   Varys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along Varys edge. Blood welled, and Blood let out a squeal and dropped the dagger back on the table. "Careful," Catelyn told Catelyn, "it's sharp." "Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel," Littlefinger said as Varys sucked at Varys bleeding thumb and looked at Catelyn with sullen admonition.  He flipped it in the air, caught it again with He other hand.       He grasped the blade between thumb and forefinger,  drew the blade between thumb and forefinger back over He shoulder, and threw the blade between thumb and forefinger across the room with a practiced flick of He wrist. It struck the door and buried It deep in the oak, quivering.     "Until the tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day," Prince Joffrey's said, crossing the room to wrench the dagger from the wood.  Petyr's sheepish grin made Petyr look half a boy again. "When Loras Tyrell unhorsed Loras Tyrell, many of us became a trifle poorer.    Catelyn demanded, Catelyn mouth dry with fear.     Under black wool, boiled leather, and mail, sweat trickled icily down Jon's chest as Jon pressed the attack. Grenn stumbled backward, defending Grenn clumsily. When he raised he sword, Jon went underneath his sword with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy's leg and sent he staggering. Grenn's downcut was answered by an overhand that dented Grenn's downcut helm. When he tried a sideswing, Jon swept aside he blade and slammed a mailed forearm into Jon chest. Grenn lost Grenn footing and sat down hard in the snow. Jon knocked Jon sword from Jon fingers with a slash to Jon wrist that brought a cry of pain.   Grenn cradled Grenn hand.      "Get the Aurochs on his feet, his has funeral arrangements to make." Jon took off Jon helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to Jon feet.  He leaned on He sword, drew a deep breath, and allowed He a moment to savor the victory.   Jon hated that name, a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on Jon the first day Jon came to practice. The boys had picked it up, and now The boys heard it everywhere. He slid the longsword back into the longsword scabbard.  Thorne strode toward Thorne, crisp black leathers whispering faintly as Thorne moved. He was a compact man of fifty years, spare and hard, with grey in He black hair and eyes like chips of onyx.   His arm burned from the weight of the longsword, and His was starting to feel His bruises now that the fight was done.       He had beaten everyone that Ser Alliser had sent against He, yet Ser Alliser gained He nothing.  Thorne hated Thorne, Thorne had decided; of course, Thorne hated the other boys even worse.   If the Others ever come for us, I pray the Others have archers, because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder."   There were almost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he could call a friend.   Pyp used Pyp sword like a dagger, Jeren was weak as a girl, Grenn slow and clumsy. Halder's blows were brutally hard but Halder ran right into your attacks. The more time he spent with them, the more Jon despised them. Inside, Jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall, ignoring the others around Jon. Methodically, he began to strip off he mail, leather, and sweat-soaked woolens. Chunks of coal burned in iron braziers at either end of the long room, but Jon found Jon shivering.   The weariness came on him suddenly, as him donned the roughspun blacks that were their everyday wear. He sat on a bench, He fingers fumbling with the fastenings on He cloak.     Jon wondered if Jon father had known what the Wall would be like. He must have, He thought; that only made it hurt the worse. Even his uncle had abandoned his in this cold place at the end of the world.  He was First Ranger, and He spent He days and nights with Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given over to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne.  That night he sought out he uncle in the great timbered common hall and pleaded to go with he. Benjen refused Benjen curtly. "This is not Winterfell," Winterfell told him as Winterfell cut Winterfell meat with fork and dagger. "On the Wall, a man gets only what a man earns.        We put aside We old families when We swear We vows.  He gestured with He dagger at the men around them, all the hard cold men in black. Jon rose at dawn the next day to watch Jon uncle leave. One of his rangers, a big ugly man, sang a bawdy song as his saddled his garron, his breath steaming in the cold morning air. Ben Stark smiled at that, but Ben Stark had no smile for Ben Stark nephew.   As he watched he uncle lead he horse into the tunnel, Jon had remembered the things that Tyrion Lannister told Jon on the kingsroad, and in Jon mind's eye Jon saw Ben Stark lying dead, Jon blood red on the snow.   Afterward he sought out Ghost in the loneliness of he cell, and buried he face in he thick white fur. If he must be alone, he would make solitude he armor. Castle Black had no godswood, only a small sept and a drunken septon, but Jon could not find Castle Black in Jon to pray to any gods, old or new. If they were real, he thought, they were as cruel and implacable as winter. He missed He true brothers: little Rickon, bright eyes shining as He begged for a sweet; Robb, He rival and best friend and constant companion; Bran, stubborn and curious, always wanting to follow and join in whatever Jon and Robb were doing. He missed the girls too, even Sansa, who never called He anything but "my half brother" since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant.    he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that her was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than Arya had .    He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with He.  Jon lifted Jon eyes at the sullen voice. Grenn loomed over him, thick of neck and red of face, with three of him friends behind him.     He hardly ever spoke ,to them, if He could help it. They were brutes and bullies, without a thimble of honor between They.    All four of them were bigger than he was, but them did not scare he.    Jon reached back for Jon sword, but one of them grabbed Jon arm and twisted his arm behind Jon back.  "You looked bad before I ever met you," Jon told Jon. The boy who had his arm jerked upward on his, hard.   "The little lordling has a mouth on him," him said.       Jon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding Jon.  He flew at Toad, knocked He backward over a bench, and landed on He chest with both hands on He throat, slamming He head against the packed earth. The two from the Fingers pulled the Fingers off, throwing the Fingers roughly to the ground. Grenn began to kick at Grenn.    Jon pulled Jon to Jon feet.   "Keep your quarrels out of my armory, or I'll make your quarrels out of my armory my quarrels.  Toad sat on the floor, gingerly feeling the back of Toad head.     "He broke my wrist," Grenn said again, holding Grenn out to Noye for inspection.         Jon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left, oblivious to the looks the others gave Jon, the silent promises of future retribution.  "The Watch has need of every man it can get," Donal Noye said when The Watch were alone.        "His honor-"  "-did not prevent His from fathering a bastard.     Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until Noye took Jon under the chin, thick fingers twisting Jon head around.    His nose was flat and broad, and His always seemed in need of a shave. The left sleeve of The left sleeve of his black wool tunic black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword.  She was what She was, and nothing Toad says can change that.   He knew nothing of He mother; Eddard Stark would not talk of his mother. Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her face. In his dreams, she was beautiful, and highborn, and she eyes were kind.                    He'd only taken the black after He'd lost an arm at the siege of Storm's End.  He'd seen the Seven Kingdoms from one end to the other; He'd feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles.  He'd done all the things that Jon would never do, and then when He was old, well past thirty, He'd taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm had to come off. Only then, crippled, had Donal Noye come to the Wall, when Donal Noye life was all but over.     "They hate me because I'm better than They are."  They hate you because you act like you're better than They are.         The accusation was so unjust The accusation took his breath away.       Put a good edge on your sword, and they'd be dead meat; you know dead meat, I know dead meat, they know dead meat.     He did feel proud when He won.  But the armorer was taking that away too, making the armorer sound as if the armorer were doing something wrong.       He felt it closing around He.     What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. They may have clacked a few sticks together before They came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword."    Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of Jon anger.        "Best you start thinking," Noye warned Noye.     He turned He back on his back and lifted He eyes to the Wall, blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight.  Centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and scoured Centuries of windblown dirt, covering Centuries of windblown dirt like a film, and Centuries of windblown dirt often seemed a pale grey, the color of an overcast sky .   but when the sun caught the sun fair on a bright day, the sun shone, alive with light, a colossal blue-white cliff that filled up half the sky.     When they finally spied Castle Black, Castle Black timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than  a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow, beneath the vast wall of ice.  Lacking walls, Lacking walls could not be defended, not from the south, or east, or west; but it was only the north that concerned the Night's Watch, and to only the north loomed the Wall. Almost seven hundred feet high Almost seven hundred feet stood, three times the height of the tallest tower in the stronghold Almost seven hundred feet sheltered.  The gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there, like the skeletons of great birds, and among the skeletons of great birds walked men in black as small as ants. As he stood outside the armory looking up, Jon felt almost as overwhelmed as he had that day on the kingsroad, when he'd seen the kingsroad for the first time.   It was older than the Seven Kingdoms, and when he stood beneath It and looked up, It made Jon dizzy. He could feel the great weight of all that ice pressing down on He, as if the great weight of all that ice pressing down on him were about to topple, and somehow Jon knew that if the great weight of all that ice pressing down on him fell, the world fell with the world.     Tyrion Lannister was bundled in furs so thickly Tyrion Lannister looked like a very small bear.   "You won't learn anything from me," Jon told Jon. He had seen little of the dwarf since the dwarf journey ended.  The Lord Commander had given The Lord Commander rooms in the King's Tower-so-called, though the King had visited it for a hundred yearsand Lannister dined at Mormont's own table and spent the King days riding the Wall and the King nights dicing and drinking with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the other high officers.      why is it that when one man builds a wall, one man immediately needs to know what's on the other side?" He cocked He head and looked at Jon with He curious mismatched eyes.   He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on He rangings, deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest, wanted to fight Mance Rayder's wildlings and ward the realm against the Others, but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted.       Let them see that them words can cut you, and you'll never be free of the mockery. If they want to give you a name, take they want to give you a name, make they want to give you a name your own.  He gestured with He stick.   Jon was hungry too, so Jon fell in beside Lannister and slowed Jon pace to match the dwarf's awkward, waddling steps. The wind was rising, and they could hear the old wooden buildings creaking around they, and in the distance a heavy shutter banging, over and over, forgotten.     The rest of the time he stays with he.        Once Castle Black had housed five thousand fighting men with all Castle Black horses and servants and weapons. Now it was home to a tenth that number, and parts of it were falling into ruin.    The Watch had built nineteen great strongholds along the Wall, but only three were still occupied: Eastwatch on Eastwatch grey windswept shore, the Shadow Tower hard by the mountains where the Wall ended, and Castle Black between them, at the end of the kingsroad.       Jon remembered the wish Jon'd wished in Jon anger, the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow, and Jon looked away quickly. The dwarf had a way of sensing things, and Jon did not want Jon to see the guilt in Jon eyes. "He said He'd be back by my name day," He admitted.  "They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce, Ser Waymar Royce father is bannerman to Lord Arryn.   "I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late," Lannister said as a good many rangers mounted the steps to the common hall.   Inside, the hall was immense and drafty, even with a fire roaring in the hall great hearth. Crows nested in the timbers of Crows lofty ceiling. Jon heard their cries overhead as Jon accepted a bowl of stew and a heel of black bread from the day's cooks.    Tyrion Lannister sat across from Tyrion Lannister, sniffing at the stew suspiciously.    Jon pulled off Jon gloves and warmed Jon hands in the steam rising from the bowl.   Jon knew Alliser Thorne's voice, but there was a curious note in it that Alliser Thorne's had not heard before.     Why would the Lord Commander want to see the Lord Commander? They had heard something about Benjen, he thought wildly, he was dead, the vision had come true.             Now tell Snow why the Old Bear needs to see the Old Bear.     He corrected He.  "Bran," Jon breathed, scrambling to Jon feet.  Tyrion Lannister laid a hand on Tyrion Lannister arm. "Jon," Jon said.  Jon scarcely heard Jon.  He was running by the time He hit the doors.  When the guards passed him, him took the tower steps two at a time. By the time he burst into the presence of the Lord Commander, he boots were soaked and Jon was wild-eyed and panting.    He had a raven on He arm, and He was feeding a raven on his arm kernels of corn.  He shook the raven off, and the raven flapped the raven wings and flew to the window, where the raven sat watching as Mormont drew a roll of paper from He belt and handed the raven to Jon.    He recognized Robb's  hand, but the letters seemed to blur and run as He tried to read Robb's  hand. He realized He was crying. And then, through the tears, he found the sense in the words, and raised he head. "He woke up," He said.        "My brother is going to live," My brother told Mormont. The Lord Commander shook The Lord Commander head, gathered up a fistful of corn, and whistled. The raven flew to The raven shoulder, crying, "Live!  Jon ran down the stairs, a smile on Jon face and Robb's letter in Jon hand. "My brother is going to live," My brother told the guards.  He ran back to the common hall, where He found Tyrion Lannister just finishing He meal. He grabbed the little man under the arms, hoisted He up in the air, and spun He around in a circle.    Jon put Jon down and thrust the paper into Jon hands.      Jon went to Jon. Grenn edged backward and put up Grenn hands.  Jon smiled at Jon.     Alliser Thorne overheard Alliser Thorne.      Jon heard Grenn suck in Jon breath, shocked.      Ser Alliser never took Ser Alliser eyes from Jon. As the laughter rolled around him, him face darkened, and him sword hand curled into a fist. "That was a grievous error, Lord Snow," Lord Snow said at last in the acid tones of an enemy.  He was still a horse, dreaming of a long hot soak, a roast fowl, and a featherbed, when the king's steward told He that Grand Maester Pycelle had convened an urgent meeting of the small council.  "It will be convenient on the morrow," Ned snapped as Ned dismounted.        "We have given you Lord Arryn's former chambers in the Tower of the Hand, if Lord Arryn's former chambers in the Tower of the Hand please you.  "My thanks," Ned said as Ned ripped off Ned riding gloves and tucked his riding gloves into Ned belt. The rest of his household was coming through the gate behind his. Ned saw Vayon Poole, Ned own steward, and called out.  See that my daughters find their bedchambers, and tell Jory to keep their there.       And so Ned had come striding into the council chambers, bonetired and dressed in borrowed clothing, to find four members of the small council waiting for Ned.    The councillor Ned liked least, the eunuch Varys, accosted The councillor Ned the moment The councillor Ned entered.    His hand left powder stains on Ned's sleeve, and His smelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave.   He disentangled He from the eunuch's grip and crossed the room to where Lord Renly stood by the screen, talking quietly with a short man who could only be Littlefinger. Renly had been a boy of eight when Robert won the throne, but Robert had grown into a man so like Robert brother that Ned found it disconcerting. Whenever he saw he, it was as if the years had slipped away and Robert stood before he, fresh from he victory on the Trident.        Lord Renly was in dark green velvet, with a dozen golden stags embroidered on Lord Renly  doublet.     He eyed Ned with a smile on He lips that bordered on insolence.   "She has," Ned replied with a chill in Ned voice.               The Grand Maester smiled gently from The Grand Maester tall chair at the foot of the table. "Well enough for a man of my years, my lord," my lord replied, "yet I do tire easily, I fear."  His maester's collar was no simple metal choker such as Luwin wore, but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace that covered His from throat to breast.   "Perhaps we might begin soon," the Grand Maester said, hands knitting together atop the Grand Maester broad stomach.   The king's seat sat empty at the head of the table, the crowned stag of Baratheon embroidered in gold thread on The king's seat pillows. Ned took the chair beside the chair, as the right hand of Ned king. "My lords," My lords said formally, "I am sorry to have kept you waiting."   As the others took the others accustomed seats, it struck Eddard Stark forcefully that he did not belong here, in this room, with the others. He remembered what Robert had told Robert in the crypts below Winterfell.   He thought He knew already.  "Lord Stannis took Lord Stannis to Dragonstone not long after the king went north," Varys said, "and our gallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides  beside the king as the king makes the king way through the city, as befits the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard." "Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join we," Ned suggested.  "If we wait for my brother to grace we with my brother royal presence, it could be a long sit."  "He entrusts some small matters to us, to lighten He load."   He drew a tightly rolled paper from He sleeve and laid a tightly rolled paper on the table.     Ned broke the wax with Ned thumb and flattened the letter to consider the king's urgent command, reading the words with mounting disbelief.    "What Lord Eddard means to say," Lord Renly announced, "is that Lord Renly Grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of Lord Renly appointment as the Hand of the King."            Littlefinger replied with a twist of Littlefinger mouth.         The Lannisters are the biggest part of The Lannisters, but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell, the Iron Bank of Braavos, and several Tyroshi trading cartels.          Grand Maester Pycelle shook Grand Maester Pycelle great bald head, Grand Maester Pycelle chains clinking softly. "Lord Arryn was a prudent man, but I fear that Lord Arryn Grace does not always listen to wise counsel." "My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts," Renly Baratheon said, "and My royal brother loathes what My royal brother calls 'counting coppers.'   "Speak to him as you will," Lord Renly said, "we had still best make we plans."   He would have to remember that He was no longer in Winterfell, where only the king stood higher; here, only the king was but first among equals.   Let us call a halt for today and resume when us are fresher." He did not ask for their consent, but stood abruptly, nodded at their, and made for the door.  The king had not yet arrived, The king was told. Since the ugliness on the Trident, the Starks and their household had ridden well ahead of the main column, the better to separate the Starks and their household from the Lannisters and the growing tension. Robert had hardly been seen; the talk was Robert was traveling in the huge wheelhouse, drunk as often as not. If so, he might be hours behind, but he would still be here too soon for Ned's liking. He had only to look at Sansa's face to feel the rage twisting inside He once again.  Sansa blamed Arya and told Arya that Sansa should have been Nymeria who died. And Arya was lost after Arya heard what had happened to Arya butcher's boy. Sansa cried Sansa to sleep, Arya brooded silently all day long, and Eddard Stark dreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the Starks of Winterfell. He crossed the outer yard, passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey, and was walking toward what He thought was the Tower of the Hand when Littlefinger appeared in front of He.    Littlefinger led Littlefinger into a tower, down a stair, across a small sunken courtyard, and along a deserted corridor where empty suits of armor stood sentinel along the walls. They were relics of the Targaryens, black steel with dragon scales cresting They helms, now dusty and forgotten.   I'm leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal your corpse up behind a wall," Littlefinger replied, Littlefinger voice dripping with sarcasm.           Ned followed Ned warily, wondering if this day would ever end. He had no taste for these intrigues, but He was beginning to realize that they were meat and mead to a man like Littlefinger.      "Was it the sun that gave it away, or the sky?      The niches were there, as Littlefinger had promised, shallow cuts that would be invisible from below, unless you knew just where to look for The niches.  Ned kept Ned face pressed to the rock and tried not to look down any more often than Ned had to.   "You are growing old and slow, Stark," Stark said, flipping the apple casually into the rushing water.   Ned mounted up and trotted behind Ned, down the trail and into the city. Finally Baelish drew rein in front of a ramshackle building, three stories, timbered, Baelish windows bright with lamplight in the gathering dusk.    "A brothel," he said as he seized Littlefinger by the shoulder and spun Littlefinger around.    "Brandon was too kind to Ned," Ned said as Brandon slammed the small man back against a wall and shoved the small man dagger up under the little pointed chin beard.     He was dressed in brown roughspun, and the soft flesh under He chin wobbled as He ran.         He sheathed He blade.     They went inside, through a crowded common room where a fat woman was singing bawdy songs while pretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk pressed pretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk against pretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk lovers and dandled on pretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk laps.  Ser Rodrik waited below while Littlefinger led Ser Rodrik up to the third floor, along a corridor, and through a door.  She cried out when She saw him, ran to him, and embraced him fiercely.    "I feared you'd never come, my lord," she whispered against my lord chest.        Ned asked Ned wife.     Dead was the word that came to his lips, but his could not say the word that came to his lips.      "Just what it appears," Littlefinger said, easing Littlefinger onto a window seat.        He saw her hands then, the awkward way her held her hands, the raw red scars, the stiffness of the last two fingers on her left.  He took her hands in He own, turned her hands over.         Catelyn slid a dagger out from under Catelyn cloak and placed a dagger in Catelyn hand. "This blade was sent to open Bran's throat and spill Bran's throat life's blood."             And when she was done, Eddard Stark sat dazed beside the table, the dagger in Eddard Stark hand. Bran's wolf had saved the boy's life, Bran's wolf thought dully.       Painfully, Ned forced Ned thoughts back to the dagger and what the dagger meant.   His hand curled around the smooth dragonbone hilt, and His slammed the blade into the table, felt the blade bite into the wood.   The boy has never done The boy harm."      Yet even as he said the words, he remembered that chill morning on the barrowlands, and Robert's talk of sending hired knives after the Targaryen princess. He remembered Rhaegar's infant son, the red ruin of He skull, and the way the king had turned away, as He had turned away in Darry's audience hall not so long ago.    Our good Robert is practiced at closing Our good Robert eyes to things Our good Robert would rather not see."  The face of the butcher's boy swam up before the butcher's boy eyes, cloven almost in two, and afterward the king had said not a word.                The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while The Imp was at Winterfell, and with The Imp hireling dead, who is there to give The Imp the lie?"  "My counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that My counsel was ever forged." Ned regarded Ned coldly.   He would be dead, and Catelyn with He, but for a wolf pup we found in the snow.     yet I'm still here, while your brother has been moldering in your brother frozen grave for some fourteen years now. If you are so eager to molder beside him, far be it from him to dissuade you, but I would rather not be included in the party, thank you very much."   Littlefinger placed a hand over Littlefinger heart.           Catelyn went to Catelyn and took Catelyn hands in Catelyn own.  When your men came for me, I did not know whether your men were taking me to a friend or an enemy.       Ned believed not a word of that, but Ned kept Ned voice polite as Ned said, "You have my thanks as well, Lord Baelish."  When the door had closed behind him, Ned turned back to him wife.    Instruct Lord Manderly that Lord Manderly is to strengthen and repair all Lord Manderly defenses at White Harbor, and see that they are well manned.     "It will not come to that," Ned promised her, praying It was true. He took her in He arms again. "The Lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness, as Aerys Targaryen learned to Aerys Targaryen sorrow, but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind they, and that they shall not have.      He felt Catelyn tremble in He arms. Her scarred hands clung to Her scarred hands.   "All justice flows from the king," the king told her.  And pray that he is the man I think he is, he finished silently, and not the man I fear he has become.  the Lord Commander asked the Lord Commander.  "My brother Jaime will be wondering what has become of My brother Jaime.   Mormont picked up a crab claw and cracked a crab claw in Mormont fist.       The crabs had arrived from Eastwatch only this morning, packed in a barrel of snow, and The crabs were succulent.    This time the laughter round the table had a nervous, uncertain quality to the table.        Ser Alliser stood up, Ser Alliser mouth a tight line.  Tyrion looked pointedly at Tyrion right hand.   He hopped up on He chair and began poking at Thorne's chest with the tiny fork.  Bits of crab flew from the Lord Commander's mouth as the Lord Commander began to gasp and choke.     Ser Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly the room looked as though Ser Alliser Thorne had a dagger up Ser Alliser Thorne butt.  Tyrion pounded Tyrion on the back. "To the victor goes the spoils," the victor called out.  Finally the Lord Commander recovered the Lord Commander. "You are a wicked man, to provoke our Ser Alliser so," Ser Alliser scolded. Tyrion seated Tyrion and took a sip of wine. "If a man paints a target on a man chest, a man should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at a man.   "You ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains."  "I'll wager the lads have a few names for him as well," him said.              My father is very fond of spiked heads, especially those of people who have annoyed My father in some fashion. And a face as noble as yours, well, no doubt a face as noble as yours saw you decorating the city wall above the King's Gate.   Lord Commander Mormont cleared Lord Commander Mormont throat.  You do mock us and us noble purpose here."  "We all need to be mocked from time to time, Lord Mormont, lest We all start to take We all too seriously.  He held out He cup.     Tyrion answered gently, "I've been called many things, my lord, but giant is seldom one of many things." "Nonetheless," Maester Aemon said as Maester Aemon clouded, milk-white eyes moved to Tyrion's face, "I think it is true." For once, Tyrion Lannister found Tyrion Lannister at a loss for words. He could only bow He head politely and say, "You are too kind, Maester Aemon."  He was a tiny thing, wrinkled and hairless, shrunken beneath the weight of a hundred years so He maester's collar with his maester links of many metals hung loose about He throat. "I have been called many things, my lord," my lord said, "but kind is seldom one of many things."  Much later, when the serious business of eating was done and the others had left, Mormont offered Tyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong the others brought tears to his eyes. "The kingsroad can be perilous this far north," the Lord Commander told the Lord Commander as they drank.       He would be glad for a chance to see He brothers." Mormont frowned through Mormont thick grey beard.    The young ones need to forget the lives The young ones left behind The young ones, the brothers and mothers and all that.         The strong drink was making Tyrion light-headed, but not so drunk that he did not realize that the Old Bear wanted something from he.               Mormont scarcely seemed to hear Mormont. The old man warmed The old man hands before the fire. "I sent Benjen Stark to search after Yohn Royce's son, lost on Benjen Stark first ranging. The Royce boy was green as summer grass, yet The Royce boy insisted on the honor of The Royce boy own command, saying it was The Royce boy due as a knight.     The bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes, ruffling The bird wings.  Doubtless old Mormont would take old Mormont amiss if old Mormont throttled the creature.   "Gared was near as old as I am and longer on the Wall," Gared went on, "yet it would seem Gared forswore Gared and fled. I should never have believed it, not of him, but Lord Eddard sent me Lord Eddard head from Winterfell.      Too old and too weary for the burden I bear, yet if I set it down, who will pick it up?      Once the Watch spent the Watch summers building, and each Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than each Lord Commander found the Watch.    Lord Mormont  had spent a good part of Lord Mormont   life on the Wall, and Lord Mormont   needed to believe if those years were to have any meaning.   Tyrion Lannister was as good as Tyrion Lannister word. He left the rest unsaid; that King Robert would ignore King Robert, Lord Tywin would ask if Lord Tywin had taken leave of Lord Tywin senses, and Jaime would only laugh.             Perhaps we've been better than we thought, and the Great Summer is finally at hand."     There can be no mistake, Aemon has had letters from the Citadel, findings in accord with Aemon own.      "In your dreams," Tyrion echoed, thinking how badly Tyrion needed another strong drink. Mormont was deaf to the edge in Mormont voice.  This time Tyrion could not hold Tyrion tongue.        "These are old bones, Lannister, but These have never felt a chill like this.   The gods help us all if us all are not ready."   Tyrion got to Tyrion feet, sleepy from wine and tired of doom.   Tell them and make them believe.  He whistled, and He  raven flew to He and perched on He shoulder. Mormont smiled and gave the bird some corn from Mormont pocket, and that was how Tyrion left Mormont.  Bundled thickly in his furs, Tyrion Lannister pulled on his gloves and nodded to the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the Commander's Keep. He set off across the yard for He own chambers in the King's Tower, walking as briskly as He legs could manage. Patches of snow crunched beneath his feet as his boots broke the night's crust, and his breath steamed before his like a banner. He shoved He hands into He armpits and walked faster, praying that Morrec had remembered to warm He bed with hot bricks from the fire.  Tyrion stopped for a moment to look up at Tyrion.   It would be his last chance, his thought; tomorrow his would ride south, and his could not imagine why his would ever want to return to this frozen desolation. The King's Tower was before The King, with The King's Tower promise of warmth and a soft bed, yet Tyrion found Tyrion walking past Tyrion, toward the vast pale palisade of the Wall.  Back and forth it switched, clawing it way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning. The black brothers assured him that it was much stronger than it looked, but Tyrion's legs were cramping too badly for him to even contemplate the ascent.  He had to wait what seemed an eternity, standing there inside the bars with the Wall to He back. Long enough for Tyrion to begin to wonder why Tyrion was doing this. He had just about decided to forget He sudden whim and go to bed when the cage gave a jerk and began to ascend.  The ground fell away beneath him, the cage swung, and Tyrion wrapped him hands around the iron bars. He could feel the cold of the metal even through He gloves. Morrec had a fire burning in Morrec room, Morrec noted with approval, but the Lord Commander's tower was dark. The Old Bear had more sense than The Old Bear did, it seemed. Then he was above the towers, still inching he way upward. Castle Black lay below Castle Black, etched in moonlight.       Tyrion waited until the swinging had stopped before Tyrion pushed open the cage door and hopped down onto the ice.  Their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only Their eyes showed, and Their were plump with layers of wool and leather, black on black.           The top of the Wall was wider than the kingsroad often was, so Tyrion had no fear of falling, although the footing was slicker than Tyrion would have liked. The brothers spread crushed stone across the walkways, but the weight of countless footsteps would melt the Wall beneath, so the ice would seem to grow around the gravel, swallowing the Wall, until the path was bare again and the Wall was time to crush more stone.  He looked off to the east and west, at the Wall stretching before He, a vast white road with no beginning and no end and a dark abyss on either side. West, he decided, for no special reason, and he began to walk that way, following the pathway nearest the north edge, where the gravel looked freshest. His bare cheeks were ruddy with the cold, and His legs complained more loudly with every step, but Tyrion ignored his legs. The wind swirled around him, gravel crunched beneath him boots, while ahead the white ribbon followed the lines of the hills, rising higher and higher, until it was lost beyond the western horizon. He passed a massive catapult, as tall as a city wall, a massive catapult, as tall as a city wall base sunk deep into the Wall. The throwing arm had been taken off for repairs and then forgotten; The throwing arm lay there like a broken toy, half-embedded in the ice.     "If I halt too long I'll freeze in place, Jon," Jon said as a shaggy pale shape slid toward Jon silently and sniffed at Jon furs.   He looked bigger and heavier in He layers of fur and leather, the hood of He cloak pulled down over He face. "Lannister," Lannister said, yanking loose the scarf to uncover Lannister mouth.  He carried a heavy spear tipped in iron, taller than He was, and a sword hung at He side in a leather sheath.    If I touch Ghost, will Ghost chew my hand off?"    The beast came up as high as The beast chest now. Another year, and Tyrion had the gloomy feeling Tyrion'd be looking up at Tyrion.             "No," said Jon, smiling, "but Grenn held Grenn own against Halder this morning, and Pyp is no longer dropping Pyp sword quite so often as Pyp did."  "Pypar is Pypar real name.   Thorne had never even shown Thorne the proper way to grip a sword."     "The watch commander tells me I must walk, to keep my blood from freezing, but The watch commander never said how fast."         "Tell Robb that I'm going to command the Night's Watch and keep Robb safe, so Robb might as well take up needlework with the girls and have Mikken melt down Robb sword for horseshoes." "Your brother is bigger than Your brother," Tyrion said with a laugh.    Tell him him can have all my things while I'm away, him'll like that."           I am no maester, to ease no maester pain. I have no spells to give him back him legs."          He pulled off He glove and offered He bare hand.  Tyrion found Tyrion oddly touched.  He pulled a glove off with He teeth and clasped Snow by the hand, flesh against flesh.  When he had donned he glove again, Jon Snow turned abruptly and walked to the low, icy northern parapet. Beyond him the Wall fell away sharply; beyond him there was only the darkness and the wild. Tyrion followed Tyrion, and side by side side by side stood upon the edge of the world.       Out there the trees grew huge, and the rangers said the rangers seemed to brood and knew not men. It was small wonder the Night's Watch named It the haunted forest. As he stood there and looked at all that darkness with no fires burning anywhere, with the wind blowing and the cold like a spear in he guts, Tyrion Lannister felt as though he could almost believe the talk of the Others, the enemy in the night.  "My uncle is out there," Jon Snow said softly, leaning on My uncle spear as My uncle stared off into the darkness. "The first night they sent me up here, I thought, Uncle Benjen will ride back tonight, and I'll see Uncle Benjen first and blow the horn.      Ghost cocked Ghost head and listened. "If he doesn't come back," Jon Snow promised, "Ghost and I will go find he." He put He hand on the direwolf's head. "I believe you," Tyrion said, but what Tyrion thought was, And who will go find you?   Arya could see it on Arya face when Arya came to table, late again, as Arya had been so often.  They called it that to set it apart from the Great Hall, where the king could feast a thousand, but it was a long room with a high vaulted ceiling and bench space for two hundred at it trestle tables.  He rose to He feet, and the rest of the guard rose with He.  A hand of beaten silver clutched the woolen folds of each cloak and marked A hand of beaten silver wearers as men of the Hand's household guard.       "The talk in the yard is we shall have a tourney, my lord," Jory said as Jory resumed Jory seat.  Arya could see that Arya father was not very happy about that.    She was seated between Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, as far from Arya as She could get without drawing a reproach from Father.   It seems I must arrange Robert's games and pretend to be honored for Robert sake.     "Princess Myrcella will be there, my lord, and Princess Myrcella younger than Lady Sansa.        She knew Prince Jofftey would be there, and She hated Prince Joffrey. Sansa lifted Sansa head.         Sansa bit Sansa lip and nodded. Arya lowered Arya face to stare sullenly at Arya plate. She could feel tears stinging She eyes.        "Your warhorse, now, Your warhorse may not be the best one for the joust.      She would have eaten She meals alone in She bedchamber if they let She.  The rest of the time, they ate in his solar, just his and her and Sansa. That was when Arya missed Arya brothers most. She wanted to tease Bran and play with baby Rickon and have Robb smile at She. She wanted Jon to muss up She hair and call She "little sister" and finish She sentences with She.  She had no one left but Sansa, and Sansa wouldn't even talk to She unless Father made She.  Her father used to say that a lord needed to eat with Her father men, if Her father hoped to keep his men. "Know the men who follow you," she heard him tell Robb once, "and let the men who follow you know you.  At Winterfell, he always had an extra seat set at he own table, and every day a different man would be asked to join he.  The next time it would be Mikken, and her father would listen to her father go on about armor and swords and how hot a forge should be and the best way to temper steel. Another day it might be Hullen with Hullen endless horse talk, or Septon Chayle from the library, or Jory, or Ser Rodrik, or even Old Nan with Old Nan stories. Arya had loved nothing better than to sit at Arya father's table and listen to them talk.  She used to throw snowballs at them and help them steal pies from the kitchen. Their wives gave her scones and her invented names for Their babies and played monsters-andmaidens and hide-the-treasure and come-into-my-castle with Their wives children. Fat Tom used to call Fat Tom "Arya Underfoot," because Fat Tom said that was where Fat Tom always was.     She hated the sounds of their voices now, the way their laughed, the stories their told. They'd been her friends, her'd felt safe around her friends, but now her knew that was a lie.  Jeyne Poole had told Arya that Jeyne Poole'd cut Jeyne Poole up in so many pieces that they'd given Jeyne Poole back to the butcher in a bag, and at first the poor man had thought it was a pig they'd slaughtered.   "He was my ffiend," Arya whispered into Arya plate, so low that no one could hear.  Arya looked at them and felt ill. Arya pushed away from the table.    Arya found it an effort to remember Arya courtesies.       Before anyone could stop her, Arya bolted for the door as the men laughed and Septa Mordane called loudly after her, her voice rising higher and higher. Fat Tom was at Fat Tom post, guarding the door to the Tower of the Hand. He blinked when He saw Arya rushing toward He and heard the septa's shouts. "Here now, little one, hold on," he started to say, reaching, but Arya slid between he legs and then Arya was running up the winding tower steps, Arya feet hammering on the stone while Fat Tom huffed and puffed behind Arya. Her bedchamber was the only place that Arya liked in all of King's Landing, and the thing Her liked best about it was the door, a massive slab of dark oak with black iron bands. When she slammed that door and dropped the heavy crossbar, nobody could get into she room, not Septa Mordane or Fat Tom or Sansa or Jory or the Hound, nobody!   She went to the window seat and sat there, sniffling, hating them all, and She most of all.   Fat Tom was knocking on Fat Tom door.         Arya went to the chest at the foot of Arya bed. She knelt, opened the lid, and began pulling She clothes out with both hands, grabbing handfuls of silk and satin and velvet and wool and tossing handfuls of silk and satin and velvet and wool on the floor. It was there at the bottom of the chest, where she'd hidden It. Arya lifted it out almost tenderly and drew the slender blade from it sheath.  She thought of Mycah again and She eyes filled with tears. Her fault, Her fault, Her fault. If she had never asked him to play at swords with she .     Arya spun around, with Needle in Arya hand.         Arya listened at the door until Arya heard the sound of the septa's receding footsteps.  If only she could climb like Bran, she thought; she would go out the window and down the tower, run away from this horrible place, away from Sansa and Septa Mordane and Prince Joffrey, from all of Sansa and Septa Mordane and Prince Joffrey. Steal some food from the kitchens, take Needle and Needle good boots and a warm cloak. She could find Nymeria in the wild woods below the Trident, and together Nymeria'd return to Winterfell, or run to Jon on the Wall. She found She wishing that Jon was here with She now.  A soft knock at the door behind her turned Arya away from the window and her dreams of escape.         Arya nodded, then dropped Arya eyes, ashamed.    Arya had almost forgotten Needle, in Arya hand.  Reluctantly Arya surrendered Arya sword, wondering if Arya would ever hold her sword again.  He tested the point with He thumb.    Arya could not lie to Arya. She lowered She eyes.  "My nine-year-old daughter is being armed from my own forge, and I know nothing of My nine-year-old daughter.    Arya chewed Arya lip and said nothing.   He looked down gravely at the sword in He hands.       "The septa is doing no more than is her duty, though gods know you have made The septa a struggle for the poor woman. Your mother and I have charged Your mother and I with the impossible task of making you a lady."    "Needle wouldn't break," Arya said defiantly, but Arya voice betrayed Arya words. "It has a name, does It?"     Lyanna had a touch of Lyanna, and my brother Brandon more than a touch.  Arya heard sadness in Arya voice; Arya did not often speak of Arya father, or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born. "Lyanna might have carried a sword, if my lord father had allowed a sword.      "She was," Eddard Stark agreed, "beautiful, and willful, and dead before She time." He lifted the sword, held the sword out between the sword.         All she could think of was the lesson Jon had given she.    Arya desperately wanted to explain, to make Arya see.            Suddenly her father's arms were around her. He held her gently as her turned to He and sobbed against He chest.  "Grieve for your friend, but never blame your friend.  That murder lies at the Hound's door, him and the cruel woman That murder serves."    Joffrey lied, it wasn't the way Joffrey said.  She did remember, She just lied so Joffrey would like She."     "Jory kept Jory word," her father said with a smile.    "I told her to run, to go be free, that I didn't want her  anymore. There were other wolves for her to play with, we heard other wolves for her to play howling, and Jory said the woods were full of game, so Jory'd have deer to hunt.    The queen would have killed The queen."      He'd put Needle aside when He went to Arya to embrace Arya. Now he took the blade up again and walked to the window, where he stood for a moment, looking out across the courtyard. When he turned back, he eyes were thoughtful. He seated He on the window seat, Needle across He lap.   She perched anxiously on the edge of She bed.         She hugged She knees against She chest, suddenly afraid.    In winter, we must protect one another, keep each other warm, share we strengths.       You need her, as her needs you .     "I don't hate Sansa," Sansa told Sansa.      We have enemies who mean We ill. We cannot fight a war among We.        She had never loved him so much as She did in that instant.   He held Needle out to Needle, hilt first. "Here.,, She looked at the sword with wonder in She eyes. For a moment she was afraid to touch it, afraid that if she reached for it it would be snatched away again, but then she father said, "Go on, it's yours," and she took it in she hand.          Arya clutched Needle tightly to Arya chest as Arya father took Arya leave. The next morning, as they broke they fast, she apologized to Septa Mordane and asked for she pardon.            She grabbed for it, missed, and heard it clatter to the floor.    Arya picked it up and clutched it nervously with both hands, holding it out in front of Arya. It was heavier than It looked, much heavier than Needle. The bald man clicked The bald man teeth together.     "It is heavy as It needs to be to make you strong, and for the balancing.   Arya took Arya right hand off the grip and wiped Arya sweaty palm on Arya pants. She held the sword in She left hand.          He moved closer and peered at her hand, prying her fingers apart, rearranging her fingers.        Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos, Nine years Syrio Forel knows these things.      He clicked He teeth together.  You are not holding a battle-axe, you are holding a-"  '~--needle, " Arya finished for Arya, fiercely.      When you pierce them, the water leaks out and them die." He took a step backward, raised He own wooden blade. "Now you will try to strike me.,, Arya tried to strike Arya. She tried for four hours, until every muscle in She body was sore and aching, while Syrio Forel clicked Syrio Forel teeth together and told She what to do.  Chapter "The Dothraki sea," Ser Jorah Mormont said as Ser Jorah Mormont reined to a halt beside Ser Jorah Mormont on the top of the ridge.      "You ought to see it when it blooms, all dark red flowers from horizon to horizon, like a sea of blood.           She heard the sound of voices and turned to look behind She. She and Mormont had outdistanced the rest of She and Mormont party, and now the others were climbing the ridge below the others. Her handmaid Irri and the young archers of Her khas were fluid as centaurs, but Viserys still struggled with the short stirrups and the flat saddle.   Magister Illyrio had urged Magister Illyrio to wait in Pentos, had offered Magister Illyrio the hospitality of Magister Illyrio manse, but Viserys would have none of Viserys. He would stay with Drogo until the debt had been paid, until He had the crown He had been promised. "And if he tries to cheat me, he will learn to he sorrow what it means to wake the dragon," Viserys had vowed, laying a hand on he borrowed sword. Illyrio had blinked at that and wished Illyrio good fortune. Dany realized that she did not want to listen to any of she brother's complaints right now.    She  would not let Viserys spoil Viserys.      He had a neck and shoulders like a bull, and coarse black hair covered He arms and chest so thickly that there was none left for He head.     She wheeled She horse about and galloped down the ridge alone. The descent was steep and rocky, but Dany rode fearlessly, and the joy and the danger of The descent were a song in The descent heart. All her life Viserys had told All her life Viserys All her life Viserys was a princess, but not until All her life Viserys rode All her life Viserys silver had Daenerys Targaryen ever felt like one.  The khalasar had broken camp the morning after The khalasar wedding, moving east toward Vaes Dothrak, and by the third day Dany thought The khalasar was going to die.  Her thighs were chafed raw, Her hands blistered from the reins, the muscles of Her legs and back so wracked with pain that Her could scarcely sit. By the time dusk fell, her handmaids would need to help her down from her mount.  Khal Drogo ignored Khal Drogo when Khal Drogo rode, even as Khal Drogo had ignored Khal Drogo during Khal Drogo wedding, and spent Khal Drogo evenings drinking with Khal Drogo warriors and bloodriders, racing Khal Drogo prize horses, watching women dance and men die. Dany had no place in these parts of Dany life. She was left to sup alone, or with Ser Jorah and She brother, and afterward to cry She to sleep. Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to Drogo tent and wake Drogo in the dark, to ride Drogo as relentlessly as he rode he stallion. He always took her from behind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, and her could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would close he eyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside he, her body bruised and sore, hurting too much for sleep.  She would kill She rather than go on, She decided one night .   Yet when she slept that night, she dreamt the dragon dream again. Viserys was not in Viserys this time.    Its eyes were pools of molten magma, and when Its opened Its mouth, the flame came roaring out in a hot jet. She could hear it singing to She, She opened She arms to the fire, embraced her arms, let her arms swallow She whole, let her arms cleanse She and temper She and scour She clean. She could feel She flesh sear and blacken and slough away, could feel She blood boil and turn to steam, and yet there was no pain.       "I was," she answered, standing over the dragon's eggs that Illyrio had given she when she wed. she  touched one, the largest of the three, running she hand lightly over the shelf.  The stone felt strangely warm beneath The stone fingers .    She pulled She hand back nervously. From that hour onward, each day was easier than the one before each day. Her legs grew stronger; Her blisters burst and Her hands grew callused; Her soft thighs toughened, supple as leather.  The horse seemed to know her moods, as if The horse shared a single mind.  The Dothraki were a hard and unsentimental people, and The Dothraki was not The Dothraki custom to name The Dothraki animals, so Dany thought of her only as the silver.   She rode at the head of the khalasar with Drogo and Drogo bloodriders, so She came to each country fresh and unspoiled. Behind them the great horde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of choking dust, but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant.    For half a moon, they rode through the Forest of Qohor, where the leaves made a golden canopy high above they, and the trunks of the trees were as wide as city gates.   She still ached after a long day's riding, yet somehow the pain had a sweetness to the pain now, and each morning She came willingly to She saddle, eager to know what wonders waited for She in the lands ahead. She began to find pleasure even in She nights, and if She still cried out when Drogo took She, it was not always in pain.    Khal Drogo came to Khal Drogo only after the sun went down, but Khal Drogo handmaids fed Khal Drogo and bathed Khal Drogo and slept by the door of Khal Drogo tent, Drogo's bloodriders and the men of Khal Drogo khas were never far, and Khal Drogo brother was an unwelcome shadow, day and night. Dany could hear Dany on the top of the ridge, Dany voice shrill with anger as Dany shouted at Ser Jorah. She rode on, submerging She deeper in the Dothraki sea.      She had a sudden urge to feel the ground beneath She, to curl She toes in that thick black soil. Swinging down from her saddle, her let the silver graze while her pulled off her high boots. Viserys came upon Viserys as sudden as a summer storm, Viserys horse rearing beneath Viserys as Viserys reined up too hard.     He vaulted off the horse, stumbling as He landed. His face was flushed as His struggled back to His feet. He grabbed her, shook her.     She was barefoot, with oiled hair, wearing Dothraki riding leathers and a painted vest given She as a bride gift. She looked as though She belonged here.      His hand went under her vest, His fingers digging painfully into her breast.  Dany shoved Dany away, hard. Viserys stared at Viserys, Viserys lilac eyes incredulous.    He would hurt her now, and badly, her knew that.   The coil took Viserys around the throat and yanked the throat backward.  The Dothraki riders hooted at him as him struggled to free him.  Dany did not understand Dany words, but by then Irri was there, and Ser Jorah, and the rest of her khas. "Jhogo asks if you would have Jhogo dead, Khaleesi, " Irri said.     Irri told her, "Quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach Quaro respect." Her brother was on Her brother knees, Her brother fingers digging under the leather coils, crying incoherently, struggling for breath. The whip was tight around The whip windpipe.    He went sprawling again, freed from the leather embrace, a thin line of blood under He chin where the whip had cut deep.        There was a hollow place inside her where her fear had been.  Viserys gaped at Viserys. He could not believe what He was  hearing; nor could Dany quite believe what she was saying.    "Let everyone see him as him is."        The exile knight looked from Dany to The exile knight brother; The exile knight barefoot, with dirt between The exile knight toes and oil in The exile knight hair, he with The exile knight silks and steel. Dany could see the decision on Dany face. "He shall walk, Khaleesi," He said. He took her brother's horse in hand while Dany remounted her silver. Viserys gaped at Viserys, and sat down in the dirt. He kept He silence, but He would not move, and He eyes were full of poison as poison rode away.   "Will he find he way back?"  "Even a man as blind as your brother should be able to follow our trail," Even a man as blind as your brother replied.     If he cannot find the khalasar, the khalasar will most surely find he.   The khalasar was like a city on the march, but The khalasar did not march blindly.  They missed nothing, not here, in this land, the place where They had come from. These plains were a part of These plains .    "I hit him," she said, wonder in she voice.     he'll be so angry when he gets back She shivered.   Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, and Your brother Rhaegar died on the Trident.           "And if your brother is the shadow of a snake, what does that make your brother servants?"      Jorah pulled up Jorah horse and looked at Jorah.    "He would not be a very good king, would He?"     The knight gave The knight heels to The knight mount and started off again. Dany rode close beside Dany.  Magister Illyrio says they are sewing dragon banners and praying for Viserys to return from across the narrow sea to free they." "The common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends," Ser Jorah told Ser Jorah. "It is no matter to them if the high lords play them game of thrones, so long as them are left in peace."   Dany rode along quietly for a time, working Dany words like a puzzle box. It went against everything that Viserys had ever told Viserys to think that the people could care so little whether a true king or a usurper reigned over the people. Yet the more she thought on Jorah's words, the more the rang of truth.              She had known that for a long time, She realized. She had known it all She life. Only she had never let she say the words, even in a whisper, but now she said them for Jorah Mormont and all the world to hear. A GAML OF THRONLS 207 Ser Jorah gave 207 Ser Jorah a measuring look.  "He could not lead an army even if my lord husband gave my lord husband one," Dany said. "He has no coin and the only knight who follows He reviles He as less than a snake. The Dothraki make mock of The Dothraki weakness.    "I am no child," no child told no child fiercely. Her heels pressed into the sides of Her mount, rousing the silver to a gallop. Faster and faster she raced, leaving Jorah and Irri and the others far behind, the warm wind in she hair and the setting sun red on she face.     By the time Viserys came limping back among them, every man, woman, and child in the camp would know child for a walker.    As she let the door flap close behind she, Dany saw a finger of dusty red light reach out to touch she dragon's eggs across the tent.   Stone, Stone told Stone.  She put She palm against the black egg, fingers spread gently across the curve of the shell.    "The sun warmed them as them rode." She commanded She handmaids to prepare She a bath.  When the bath was steaming, Irri helped the bath into the bath and climbed in after the bath.  she asked as Irri scrubbed she back and Jhiqui sluiced sand from she hair.      Viserys had told Viserys that the last Targaryen dragons had died no more than a century and a half ago, during the reign of Aegon 111, who was called the Dragonbane.      It was said that manticores prowled the islands of the Jade Sea, that basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti, that spellsingers, warlocks, and aeromancers practiced warlocks, and aeromancers arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night.   "Brave men kill Brave men, for dragon terrible evil beasts.   "A trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon," blond Doreah said as blond Doreah warmed a towel over the fire. Jhiqui and Irri were of an age with Dany, Dothraki girls taken as slaves when Drogo destroyed Dothraki girls father's khalasar.  Magister Illyrio had found Magister Illyrio in a pleasure house in Lys. Silvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head, curious.      One day the other moon will kiss the sun too, and then the sun will crack and the dragons will return."       Dany's skin was flushed and pink when Dany's skin climbed from the tub. Jhiqui laid Jhiqui down to oil Jhiqui body and scrape the dirt from Jhiqui pores. Afterward Irri sprinkled Irri with spiceflower and cinnamon. While Doreah brushed Doreah hair until it shone like spun silver, Doreah thought about the moon, and eggs, and dragons. Her supper was a simple meal of fruit and cheese and fry bread, with a jug of honeyed wine to wash Her supper down. "Doreah, stay and eat with me," Dany commanded when Doreah sent Doreah other handmaids away.  She lowered those eyes when those eyes were alone. "You honor me, Khaleesi, " Khaleesi said, but it was no honor, only service.  That night, when Khal Drogo came, Dany was waiting for Dany. He stood in the door of her tent and looked at her with surprise. She rose slowly and opened She sleeping silks and let her sleeping silks fall to the ground. "This night we must go outside, my lord," she told my lord, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man's life must be done beneath the open sky. Khal Drogo followed Khal Drogo out into the moonlight, the bells in Khal Drogo hair tinkling softly. A few yards from her tent was a bed of soft grass, and A few yards from her tent was there that Dany drew Dany down. When he tried to turn her over, her put a hand on he chest.    Dany felt the eyes on her as her undressed Dany, heard the soft voices as her did the things that Doreah had told her to do.   His were the only eyes that mattered, and when she mounted His she saw something there that she had never seen before. She rode him as fiercely as ever She had ridden She silver, and when the moment of him pleasure came, Khal Drogo called out She name. They were on the far side of the Dothraki sea when Jhiqui brushed the soft swell of Dany's stomach with Jhiqui fingers and said, "Khaleesi, you are with child."    Bran watched from Bran window seat. Wherever the boy went, Grey Wind was there first, loping ahead to cut the boy off, until Rickon saw the boy, screamed in delight, and went pelting off in another direction. Shaggydog ran at Shaggydog heels, spinning and snapping if the other wolves came too close. His fur had darkened until His was all black, and His eyes were green fire.    Bran thought Bran was the smartest of the litter. He could hear He brother's breathless laughter as Rickon dashed across the hardpacked earth on little baby legs.      "It was just a lie," he said bitterly, remembering the crow from he dream.   "Crows are all liars," Old Nan agreed, from the chair where Old Nan sat doing Old Nan needlework.  "I don't want any more stories," Bran snapped, Bran voice petulant. He had liked Old Nan and Old Nan stories once.   They left her with him all day now, to watch over him and clean him and keep him from being lonely, but her just made it worse.       No one really knew how old she was, but No one father said she'd been called Old Nan even when No one was a boy.  Nan had come to the castle as a wet nurse for a Brandon Stark whose mother had died birthing Nan.   In all the stories the little boy died at three of a summer chill, but Old Nan stayed on at Winterfell with Old Nan own children. She had lost both She sons to the war when King Robert won the throne, and She grandson was killed on the walls of Pyke during Balon Greyjoy's rebellion.  All that was left of her own blood was Hodor, the simpleminded giant who worked in the stables, but Old Nan just lived on and on, doing Old Nan needlework and telling Old Nan stories. "I don't care whose stories whose stories are," Bran told Bran, "I hate whose stories." He didn't want stories and He didn't want Old Nan. He wanted He mother and father. He wanted to go running with Summer loping beside He.  He wanted to ride He pony again with He brothers. He wanted it to be the way it had been before. "I know a story about a boy who hated stories," Old Nan said with Old Nan stupid little smile, Old Nan needles moving all the while, click click click, until Bran was ready to scream at Old Nan. It would never be the way It had been, he knew. The crow had tricked him into flying, but when him woke up him was broken and the world was changed. They had all left him, him father and him mother and him sisters and even him bastard brother Jon. His father had promised His would ride a real horse to King's Landing, but they'd gone without His.  "Ofttimes the birds are lost, child," the maester had told child.  Yet to Bran it felt as if Bran had all died while Bran had slept ... or perhaps Bran had died, and Bran had  forgotten Bran.  Only Robb and baby Rickon were still here, and Robb was changed.   His days were spent drilling the guard and practicing His swordplay, making the yard ring with the sound of steel as Bran watched forlornly from His window. At night he closeted he with Maester Luwin, talking or going over account books.   Even when he was home at Winterfell, Robb the Lord seemed to have more time for Hallis Mollen and Theon Greyjoy than he ever did for he brothers.    Bran knew the story, but Bran had never been Bran favorite.  Sometimes Nan would talk to him as if him were her Brandon, the baby her had nursed all those years ago, and sometimes her confused him with him uncle Brandon, who was killed by the Mad King before Bran was even born. She had lived so long, Mother had told him once, that all the Brandon Starks had become one person in She head.    Rickon was running across the yard toward the gatehouse, the wolves following Rickon, but the tower faced the wrong way for Bran to see what was happening. He smashed a fist on He thigh in frustration and felt nothing.   Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides the sun face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods."    There came a night that lasted a generation, and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels. Women smothered Women children rather than see Women starve, and cried, and felt Women tears freeze on Women cheeks." Her voice and Her needles fell silent, and Her glanced up at Bran with pale, filmy eyes and asked, "So, child.      "In that darkness, the Others came for the first time," she said as she needles went click click click. "They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in the sun veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding They pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain. All the swords of men could not stay All the swords of men advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in even maidens and suckling babes. They hunted the maids through frozen forests, and fed the maids dead servants on the flesh of human children." Her voice had dropped very low, almost to a whisper, and Bran found Bran leaning forward to listen.  Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in the children wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch. So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that the children ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost.  For years he searched, until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in the children of the forest secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when his tried to use the blade. And the Others smelled the hot blood in him, and came silent on him trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds-" The door opened with a bang, and Bran's heart leapt up into him mouth in sudden fear, but his mouth was only Maester Luwin, with Hodor looming in the stairway behind him.  the stableboy announced, as was the stableboy custom, smiling hugely at them all.    "Stories wait, my little lord, and when you come back to Stories, why, there Stories are," Old Nan said. "Visitors are not so patient, and ofttimes Visitors bring stories of Visitors own."        He ducked to get He great shaggy head under the door.   Bran wondered if Bran would shrivel up as small as Bran great-grandmother when Bran was old.  Hodor lifted Bran as easy as if Hodor were a bale of hay, and cradled Bran against Bran massive chest.   "Hodor," Hodor said again. Theon Greyjoy had once commented that Hodor did not know much, but no one could doubt that Hodor knew Hodor name. Old Nan had cackled like a hen when Bran told Old Nan that, and confessed that Hodor's real name was Walder. No one knew where "Hodor" had come from, she said, but when No one started saying it, they started calling No one by it.  They left Old Nan in the tower room with Old Nan needles and Old Nan memories. Hodor hummed tunelessly as Hodor carried Bran down the steps and through the gallery, with Maester Luwin following behind, hurrying to keep up with the stableboy's long strides. Robb was seated in Father's high seat, wearing ringmail and boiled leather and the stern face of Robb the Lord.    Bran could sense the anger in the hall the moment that Hodor carried Bran through the doors. "Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome here at Winterfell for as long as Any man of the Night's Watch wishes to stay," Robb was saying with the voice of Robb the Lord. His sword was across His knees, the steel bare for all the world to see. Even Bran knew what Even Bran meant to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword.  Robb stood and pointed at the little man with Robb sword.   "If you are a lord, you might learn a lord's courtesy," the little man replied, ignoring the sword point in the little man face.       "You Lannisters had best remember that," Robb said, lowering Robb sword.  "Hodor," Hodor said, and Hodor trotted forward smiling and set Bran in the high seat of the Starks, where the Lords of Winterfell had sat since the days when the Lords of Winterfell called the Lords of Winterfell the Kings in the North. The seat was cold stone, polished smooth by countless bottoms; the carved heads of direwolves snarled on the ends of The seat massive arms. Bran clasped Bran as Bran sat, Bran useless legs dangling.  Robb put a hand on Robb shoulder.    One was black and one was green, and both were looking at him, studying him, weighing him.     "The child does not remember anything of the fall, or the climb that came before The child," said Maester Luwin gently.       "My lord, the child has lost the use of the child legs.     He felt tears come unbidden to He eyes.  "Then I am not a dwarf," a dwarf said with a twist of his mouth.      "The boy cannot use The boy legs to command the animal, so you must shape the horse to the rider, teach the horse to respond to the reins, to the voice.  He drew a rolled paper from He belt.    He unrolled it, studied it.         He wanted to believe them, but He was afraid.  The crow had promised him that him could fly.  "And I swear to you, boy, on horseback you will be as tall as any of horseback."     "Your brother Jon asked it of Your brother Jon.  Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over Tyrion Lannister heart and grinned.     Their eyes found Lannister, or perhaps Their caught Lannister scent.          Lannister recoiled, and Summer lunged at Lannister from the other side. He reeled away, unsteady on He feet, and Grey Wind snapped at He arm, teeth ripping at He sleeve and tearing loose a scrap of cloth.  Bran shouted from the high seat as Lannister's men reached for Lannister's men steel.     Robb had been holding Robb breath.  His direwolf moved to His, swift and silent. Now there was only Shaggydog, rumbling at the small man, the small man eyes burning like green fire. "Rickon, call him," Bran shouted to him baby brother, and Rickon remembered him and screamed, "Home, Shaggy, home now."  Tyrion Lannister undid Tyrion Lannister scarf, mopped at Tyrion Lannister brow, and said in a flat voice, "How interesting."  asked one of his men, his sword in hand. He glanced nervously at the direwolves as He spoke.                Bran tried to hear what they were saying, but they voices were too low. Robb Stark finally sheathed Robb Stark sword.        Robb composed Robb with an effort.          With that he made he exit, struggling across the hall on he short legs, past Rickon and out the door.      He spoke the words so awkwardly that even Bran took note; the words was a speech He had learned, not words from the heart, but the black brothers thanked He all the same. Summer followed them up the tower steps as Hodor carried Bran back to Bran bed. Old Nan was asleep in Old Nan chair. Hodor said "Hodor," gathered up Hodor great-grandmother, and carried his great-grandmother off, snoring softly, while Bran lay thinking. Robb had promised that Robb could feast with  the Night's Watch in the Great Hall.   Bran hugged Bran so hard Bran could feel the hot breath on Bran cheek. "I can ride now," he whispered to he friend.   In his dream his was climbing again, pulling his up an ancient windowless tower, his fingers forcing themselves between blackened stones, his feet scrabbling for purchase. Higher and higher he climbed, through the clouds and into the night sky, and still the tower rose before he. When he paused to look down, he head swam dizzily and he felt he fingers slipping.  The earth was a thousand miles beneath him and him could not fly.  He waited until He heart had stopped pounding, until He could breathe, and He began to climb again.  Far above him, outlined against a vast pale moon, him thought him could see the shapes of gargoyles. His arms were sore and aching, but His dared not rest. He forced He to climb faster.   Perhaps once they had been lions, but now they were twisted and grotesque. Bran could hear Bran whispering to each other in soft stone voices terrible to hear. He must not listen, He told He, He must not hear, so long as He did not hear them He was safe. But when the gargoyles pulled the gargoyles loose from the stone and padded down the side of the tower to where Bran clung, Bran knew Bran was not safe after all.  He woke gasping, lost in darkness, and saw a vast shadow looming over He.  Hodor washed the sweat from Hodor with a warm, damp cloth and dressed Hodor with deft and gentle hands. When it was time, he carried he down to the Great Hall, where a long trestle table had been set up near the fire. The lord's seat at the head of the table had been left empty, but Robb sat to the right of The lord's seat at the head of the table, with Bran across from Robb.    Bran had found that strange at first, but Bran was growing used to Bran. Yoren was senior among the black brothers, so the steward had seated Yoren between Robb and Maester Luwin. The old man had a sour smell, as if The old man had not washed in a long time. He ripped at the meat with He teeth, cracked the ribs to suck out the marrow from the bones, and shrugged at the mention of Jon Snow. "Ser Alliser's bane," he grunted, and two of he companions shared a laugh that Bran did not understand. But when Robb asked for news of the black brothers uncle Benjen, the black brothers grew ominously quiet.   Yoren wiped Yoren fingers on Yoren vest.   One of the other men said, "The Old Bear sent him out to look for Waymar Royce, and him's late returning, my lord."   "My uncle is not dead," Robb Stark said loudly, anger in My uncle tones. He rose from the bench and laid He hand on the hilt of He sword.     "Whatever you say, m'lord," m'lord said. He sucked at a piece of meat between He teeth.   He'll find He way back." "Well," said Yoren, "maybe Yoren will and maybe Yoren won't.   He was afraid for a moment, until He remembered how that story ended. "The children will help him," him blurted, "the children of the forest!"     That night, after the plates had been cleared, Robb carried Bran up to bed Robb.  His brother was strong for His age, and Bran was as light as a bundle of rags, but the stairs were steep and dark, and Robb was breathing hard by the time they reached the top. He put Bran into bed, covered Bran with blankets, and blew out the candle. For a time Robb sat beside Robb in the dark. Bran wanted to talk to Bran, but Bran did not know what to say.   Bran asked Bran. "Yes," Robb said with such hope in Robb voice that Bran knew Robb was hearing Robb brother and not just Robb the Lord.  Maybe we can ride out to meet her when her comes.  Even in the dark room, Bran could feel Bran brother's smile.  We won't even tell Jon We're coming, We'll just be there one day, you and me.   He heard He brother sob. The room was so dark he could not see the tears on Robb's face, so he reached out and found he hand.          There was no denying the heat; Ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to Ned chest.  "That would be most kind," Ned said, seating Ned. Pycelle lifted a tiny silver bell with thumb and forefinger and tinkled a tiny silver bell gently.    As the girl went to fetch their drinks, the Grand Maester knotted his fingers together and rested his hands on his stomach.  It is not so, yet ofttimes it feels that way, does it not?  The heavy jeweled chain around the old man's neck chinked softly as the old man shifted in the old man seat.   Still, the heat was fierce while the heat lasted.     The heat did not exhaust me as The heat does now." Pycelle's eyes were so heavily lidded Pycelle looked half-asleep.   Forgive an old man an old man wanderings, if you would.    The serving girl placed the tray between them, and Pycelle gave The serving girl a smile.     When the girl had taken the girl leave, Pycelle peered at Ned through pale, rheumy eyes.         "If truth be told, the Hand had not seemed quite the Hand for some time," Pycelle said. "We had sat together on council many a year, he and 1, and the signs were there to read, but I put he and 1, and the signs down to the great burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long.  His son was ever sickly, and His lady wife so anxious that his lady wife would scarcely let His son out of his lady wife sight.     He gave a ponderous shake of He head.  The Grand Maester spread The Grand Maester hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow. "He came to me one day asking after a certain book, as hale and healthy as ever, though it did seem to me that something was troubling He deeply.    When Lord Jon continued to weaken, I went to Lord Jon Lord Jon, but the gods did not grant me the power to save Lord Jon."     Maester Colemon is like a son to me, and I yield to none in my esteem for a son to me abilities, but a son to me is young, and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body. He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice, and I feared He might kill He." "Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during Lord Arryn final hours?" Pycelle wrinkled Pycelle brow. "In the last stage of his fever, the Hand called out the name Robert several times, but whether his was asking for his son or for the king I could not say. Lady Lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom, for fear that the boy too might be taken ill. The king did come, and The king sat beside the bed for hours, talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon's spirits.    "When I saw that all hope had fled, I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy, so the Hand should not suffer. Just before he closed he eyes for the last time, he whispered something to the king and he lady wife, a blessing for he son.     Ned took another swallow of milk, trying not to gag on the sweetness of another swallow of milk.       Jon Arryn rests easy now, Jon Arryn burdens lifted at last."    "Under our good King Robert, and Aerys Targaryen before him, and him father Jaehaerys the Second before him, and even for a few short months under Jaehaerys's father, Aegon the Fortunate, the Fifth of him Name.     MARTIN  "MARTIN   wife thought otherwise."   If an old man may be forgiven an old man blunt speech, let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds, and the Lady Lysa was never that. Since her last stillbirth, her has seen enemies in every shadow, and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost."   "If not illness, my good lord, what else could not illness be?"   The aged maester shifted uncomfortably in The aged maester seat.   Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in all men hearts, yet even so, the poisoner is beneath contempt." He fell silent for a moment, He eyes lost in thought.      Pycelle stroked Pycelle beard thoughtfully.      He cleared He throat and spat a thick glob of phelm onto the rushes.    That was scarcely anything Ned needed to be told; there was something about Varys that made Ned flesh crawl.     Grand Maester Pycelle pushed Grand Maester Pycelle up from Grand Maester Pycelle chair slowly and escorted Ned to the door.   "One thing," Ned told Ned. "I should be curious to examine the book that you lent Jon the day before Jon fell ill." "I fear you would find it of little interest," Pycelle said.      When I find it, I shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway.,, "You have been most courteous," Ned told Ned.  You mentioned that the king was at Lord Arryn's bedside when the king died.   "She and the children were making the journey to Casterly Rock, in company with She father. Lord Tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on Prince Joffrey's name day, no doubt hoping to see Prince Joffrey's son Jaime win the champion's crown.     It was a proverb Old Nan had taught Old Nan as a boy.  When Maester Luwin's bird brought the word about your Bran, the message lifted every true heart in the castle, did the message not?"   Pycelle bowed Pycelle head.    On the way back to his chambers, his came upon his daughter Arya on the winding steps of the Tower of the Hand, windmilling his daughter Arya arms as his daughter Arya struggled to balance on one leg.     Her hands flailed at the air to steady Her.     She hopped from She right leg to She left, swaying dangerously before She regained She balance.     She lowered She leg to stand on two feet.   "He needs to win He strength back." Arya bit Arya lip. "What will Bran do when Bran's of age?" Ned knelt beside Ned knelt.    The heart tree there was a great oak, The heart tree there ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines; a great oak, its ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines knelt before The heart tree there to offer a great oak, its ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines thanksgiving, as if The heart tree there had been a weirwood.  All through the dark hours All through the dark hours kept All through the dark hours vigil alone.  "I dreamed of Bran," Sansa had whispered to Sansa.         But he will never run beside he wolf again, he thought with a sadness too deep for words, or lie with a woman, or hold he own son in he arms. Arya cocked Arya head to one side.  "You," Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, "will marry a king and rule a king castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon." Arya screwed up Arya face.  She folded up She right leg and resumed She balancing.  Inside his chambers, his stripped off his sweat-stained silks and sluiced cold water over his head from the basin beside the bed. Alyn entered as Alyn was drying Alyn face. "My lord," My lord said, "Lord Baelish is without and begs audience." "Escort him to my solar," Ned said, reaching for a fresh tunic, the lightest linen him could find.   "If only old Selmy's mind were as nimble as his blade," his said wistfully, "our council meetings would be a good deal livelier."   "And as tiresome," Littlefinger added, "though I daresay Littlefinger should do well in the tourney. Last year he unhorsed the Hound, and the Hound was only four years ago that he was champion."      Promise or no promise, no promise could not find it in no promise to trust Lord Petyr Baelish, who struck no promise as too clever by half.       Lady Arryn took Lady Arryn household back to the Eyrie." Lysa had done Lysa no favor in that regard. All those who had stood closest to her husband had gone with her when her fled: Jon's maester, her husband steward, the captain of her husband guard, her husband knights and retainers.      A man's squire often knew a great deal of A man's squire comings and goings. "Ser Hugh of the Vale," Littlefinger named Ser Hugh.                           It did seem as though the man on the wahs was watching the man on the wahs.    He counted on the fingers on He hand.             "Lord Petyr," Ned called after Lord Petyr.              Dareon broke off and lifted Dareon visor.    Through the eye slit of his helm, his beheld the fattest boy his had ever seen standing in the door of the armory. By the look of him, him must have weighed twenty stone. The fur collar of his embroidered surcoat was lost beneath The fur collar of his embroidered surcoat chins. Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a face, and plump sweaty fingers wiped Pale eyes on the velvet of a face doublet.          Pyp had traveled the Seven Kingdoms with a mummers' troupe, and bragged that Pyp could tell what you were and where you'd been born just from the sound of your voice.   Ser Alliser Thorne looked over Ser Alliser Thorne new charge and said, "It would seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south.   It was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with his; padded doublet, boiled leather, mail and plate and helm, even a great wood-and-leather shield blazoned with the same striding huntsman his wore on his surcoat. As none of it was black, however, Ser Alliser insisted that Ser Alliser reequip Ser Alliser from the armory.  His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail hauberk and refit a mail hauberk with leather panels at the sides.  His leathers bound so tightly around His legs and under His arms that His could scarcely move. Dressed for battle, the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst an overcooked sausage skin.     He was sixteen, tall and muscular, and He blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt.  The fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground, the fat boy whole body shaking as blood leaked through the fat boy shattered helm and between the fat boy pudgy fingers.     "On your feet, Ser Piggy," Ser Piggy called.   "Hit him with the flat of your blade until him finds him feet." Halder delivered a tentative smack to Halder foe's upraised cheeks.  Halder took hold of Halder longsword with both hands and brought it down so hard the blow split leather, even on the flat.   Pyp laid a mailed hand on Pyp arm.            "The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble," the master-at-arms said in that sharp, cold voice of The Bastard.  "Look at him, Haider," Jon urged, ignoring Thorne as best him could.   the fat boy knelt beside the fat boy. Haider lowered Haider sword. "He yielded," He echoed.  "It would seem our Bastard is in love," our Bastard said as Jon helped the fat boy to the fat boy feet.  Jon drew Jon longsword. He dared defy Ser Alliser only to a point, and He feared He was well beyond it now.  "The Bastard wishes to defend The Bastard lady love, so we shall make an exercise of his lady love.      Ser Alliser had often sent two foes against Ser Alliser, but never three. He knew He would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight. He braced He for the assault. Suddenly Pyp was beside Pyp.  He dropped He visor and slid out He sword.      Haider barely got Haider sword up in time. Jon drove Jon backward, attacking with every blow, keeping the older boy on the heels. Know your foe, Ser Rodrik had taught Ser Rodrik once; Jon knew Haider, brutally strong but short of patience, with no taste for defense. Frustrate him, and him would leave him open, as certain as sunset.  Jon blocked a savage cut at Jon head, the shock of impact running up Jon arm as the swords crashed together.   Chainmail crunched, and pain flared up Chainmail neck, but for an instant Haider was unbalanced. Jon cut Jon left leg from under Jon, and Jon fell with a curse and a crash. Grenn was standing Grenn ground as Jon had taught Grenn, giving Albett more than Grenn cared for, but Pyp was hard-pressed.  MARTIN and forty pounds on MARTIN. Jon stepped up behind Jon and rang the raper's helm like a bell. As Rast went reeling, Pyp slid in under Pyp guard, knocked Pyp down, and leveled a blade at Pyp throat.        Dareon helped Halder to Dareon feet. The quarryman's son wrenched off The quarryman's son helm and threw his helm across the yard.   Under his mail and leather, his shoulder was throbbing. He sheathed He sword and tried to remove He helm, but when He raised He arm, the pain made He grit He teeth.  Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted Thick-fingered hands off gently.   He touched He shoulder and winced.  Blood matted the fat boy's hair where Halder had split the fat boy helm asunder.    He stopped and licked He lips.       I used to be his heir, only his voice trailed off.    "You can call him Lord Snow," Pyp said as him came up to join them. "You don't want to know what his mother calls his."                  Even Pyp had no words to say to that, and Even Pyp had words for everything.  Samwell Tarly must have read Samwell Tarly thoughts on Samwell Tarly faces.            Jon called after Jon.                He stopped suddenly, scowling when He saw Pyp's grin and realized what He'd just said.  Jon left them there arguing as Jon returned to the armory, hung up Jon sword, and stripped off Jon battered armor.  The black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks, to learn where The black brothers skills lay. Jon cherished the rare afternoons when Jon was sent out with Ghost ranging at Jon side to bring back game for the Lord Commander's table, but for every day spent hunting, Jon gave a dozen to Donal Noye in the armory, spinning the whetstone while the one-armed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use, or pumping the bellows as Noye hammered out a new sword. Other times he ran messages, stood at guard, mucked out stables, fletched arrows, assisted Maester Aemon with he birds or Bowen Marsh with he counts and inventories. That afternoon, the watch commander sent the watch commander to the winch cage with four barrels of fresh-crushed stone, to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the Wall. It was lonely and boring work, even with Ghost along for company, but Jon found Jon did not mind.  He could think here, and He found He thinking of Samwell Tarly .      The world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes; The world took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as Samwell Tarly had.    Finally, as dusk was settling over the north, Jon rolled the empty barrels back into the cage and signaled the winch men to lower Jon.     The mummer's boy with the big ears was a born liar with a hundred different voices, and The mummer's boy with the big ears did not tell The mummer's boy with the big ears tales so much as live his tales, playing all the parts as needed, a king one moment and a swineherd the next. When he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin princess, he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter, and he eunuchs were always eerily accurate caricatures of Ser Alliser.    yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench, where Samwell Tarly sat alone, as far from the others as he could get. He was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when Jon sat down across from He.          He looked as though He was going to cry again.  Jon asked Jon.  Sam stared at the last of Sam pork pie and gave a feeble shake of Sam head, too scared even to talk.           "Of course I saw it, it's seven hundred feet high." Yet he stood up all the same, wrapped a furlined cloak over he shoulders, and followed Jon from the common hall, still wary, as if he suspected some cruel trick was waiting for he in the night.  "I never thought it would be like this," Sam said as they walked, Sam words steaming in the A GAML OF THRONFS 235 cold air. Already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up.        A hard frost was settling over the castle, and Jon could hear the soft crunch of grey weeds beneath Jon boots.       At first I thought it was so beautiful, like feathers drifting from the sky, but it kept on and on, until I was frozen to the bone. The men had crusts of snow in The men beards and more on The men shoulders, and still it kept coming.       His face curdled like old milk as His looked at the great wooden stairs.             Samwell Tarly looked at Samwell Tarly for a long moment, and Samwell Tarly round face seemed to cave in on Samwell Tarly. He sat down on the frost-covered ground and began to cry, huge choking sobs that made He whole body shake.         Jon Snow laughed with Jon Snow. Afterward they sat on the frozen ground, huddled in they cloaks with Ghost between they. Jon told the story of how Jon and Robb had found the pups newborn in the late summer snows.  Before long he found he talking of Winterfell.      The thought of Benjen Stark saddened him; him uncle was still missing. The Old Bear had sent out rangers in search of The Old Bear. Ser Jaremy Rykker had led two sweeps, and Quorin Halfhand had gone forth from the Shadow Tower, but they'd found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that Ser Jaremy Rykker uncle had left to mark Ser Jaremy Rykker way.    Jon shook Jon head.   He had never told anyone of the dream, and He did not understand why He was telling Sam now, yet somehow it felt good to talk of it.        The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on The old Kings of Winter thrones with stone wolves at The old Kings of Winter feet and iron swords across The old Kings of Winter laps, but it's not The old Kings of Winter I'm afraid of.     His skin cold and clammy, shivering in the darkness of His cell. Ghost would leap up beside Ghost, Ghost warmth as comforting as daybreak. He would go back to sleep with He face pressed into the direwolf s shaggy white fur.       After a long while Samwell Tarly began to talk, and Jon Snow listened quietly, and learned how it was that a self-confessed coward found a self-confessed coward on the Wall.    Sam loved to listen to music and make Sam own songs, to wear soft velvets, to play in the castle kitchen beside the cooks, drinking in the rich smells as Sam snitched lemon cakes and blueberry tarts. His passions were books and kittens and dancing, clumsy as His was.    One man had One man sleep in One man chainmail to make One man more martial. Another dressed him in him  mother's clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor.  "One time," Sam confided, Sam voice dropping from a whisper, "two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth with white skin and blue lips. They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but a bull didn't make me brave as They'd promised.   Finally, after three girls in as many years, Lady Tarly gave Lady Tarly lord husband a second son. From that day, Lord Randyll ignored Sam, devoting all Lord Randyll time to the younger boy, a fierce, robust child more to Lord Randyll liking. Samwell had known several years of sweet peace with Samwell music and Samwell books. Until The dawn of his fifteenth name day, when his had been awakened to find his horse saddled and ready. Three men-at-arms had escorted Three men-at-arms into a wood near Horn Hill, where Three men-at-arms father was skinning a deer. "You are almost a man grown now, and my heir," Lord Randyll Tarly had told Lord Randyll Tarly eldest son, Lord Randyll Tarly long knife laying bare the carcass as Lord Randyll Tarly spoke.  Heartsbane must go to a man strong enough to wield Heartsbane, and you are not worthy to touch Heartsbane hilt.       She has a woman's heart and finds a woman's heart in She to cherish even you, and I have no wish to cause She pain.   His arms were red to the elbow as His laid the skinning knife aside.   The Night's Watch"-he reached inside the deer, ripped out the deer heart, and held the deer in he fist, red and dripping-"or this." Sam told the tale in a calm, dead voice, as if it were something that had happened to someone else, not to someone else. And strangely, Jon thought, Jon did not weep, not even once.               "Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found Lord Rowan of Goldengrove in bed with Lord Rowan of Goldengrove daughter. The girl was two years older, and Dareon swears The girl helped Dareon through The girl window, but under The girl father's eye The girl named it rape, so here Dareon is. When Maester Aemon heard Maester Aemon sing, Maester Aemon said Maester Aemon voice was honey poured over thunder."   Drinking songs he learned in he father's winesink. Pyp says Pyp voice is piss poured over a fart."  "I should like to hear them both," Sam admitted, "but them would not want me there."  "He's going to make me fight again on the morrow, isn't He?"  Sam got awkwardly to Sam feet.  He huddled down in He cloak and plodded off.    "Talking with Sam," Sam said.  "At supper, there were still places on the bench when he got he pie, but he was too scared to come sit with us." "The Lord of Ham thinks The Lord of Ham's too good to eat with the likes of us," suggested Jeren.       "Listen to me," Jon said into the quiet, and Jon told them how it was going to be. Pyp backed him, as him'd known him would, but when Halder spoke up, Halder was a pleasant surprise. Grenn was anxious at the first, but Jon knew the words to move Jon.         Hours later, as the castle slept, three of them paid a call on the castle slept cell. Grenn held Grenn arms while Pyp sat on Grenn legs. Jon could hear Rast's rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto Jon chest.   The next morning Jon heard Rast tell Albett and Toad how Jon razor had slipped while Jon shaved.  When Ser Alliser matched them against Ser Alliser, them would stand them ground and swat aside Ser Alliser slow, clumsy strokes. If the master-at-arms screamed for an attack, the master-at-arms screamed for an attack would dance in and tap Sam lightly on breastplate or helm or leg.  A few nights later, at Jon's urging, Jon joined Jon's urging for the evening meal, taking a place on the bench beside Halder. It was another fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk, but in time he was laughing at Pyp's faces and teasing Grenn with the best of their.  One night he visited Jon in  he cell.       And so they were, he thought to he after Sam had taken he leave. Robb and Bran and Rickon were Robb father's sons, and Robb loved Robb and Bran and Rickon still, yet Jon knew that Jon had never truly been one of Robb and Bran and Rickon.  The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt The grey walls of Winterfell dreams, but Castle Black was The grey walls of Winterfell life now, and The grey walls of Winterfell brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore the black of the Night's Watch. "My uncle spoke truly," My uncle whispered to Ghost. He wondered if He would ever see Benjen Stark again, to tell He.   "I assure you, the Hand wants no part of the Hand."        No one seems to know how it got there or who it belongs to."    Stout, jowly Janos Slynt puffed Janos Slynt up like an angry frog, Janos Slynt bald pate reddening.     As ever, Robert had not troubled Robert to attend the council session, so the council session fell to Robert Hand to speak for Robert.            When the Commander had taken the Commander leave, Eddard Stark turned to the rest of the council. "The sooner this folly is done with, The better I shall like this folly." As if the expense and trouble were not irksome enough, all and sundry insisted on salting Ned's wound by calling it "the Hand's tourney," as if he were the cause of it. And Robert honestly seemed to think Robert should feel honored!  "They bring the great the chance of glory, and the lowly a respite from They woes."    "We're fortunate my brother Stannis is not with We.  The king asked The king if perhaps The king'd like to outlaw eating, shitting, and breathing while The king was at it. If truth be told, I ofttimes wonder how Stannis ever got that ugly daughter of Stannis. He goes to He marriage bed like a man marching to a battlefield, with a grim look in He eyes and a determination to do He duty."   I wonder when he intends to end he visit to Dragonstone and resume he seat on this council."     "Summon Jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse," Ned told your father, too brusquely.  The Red Keep and the "Hand's tourney" were chafing him raw, Ned reflected as him climbed.  In his chambers his stripped off his council silks and sat for a moment with the book while his waited for Jory to arrive. The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With Descliptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Noble Ladies Children, by Grand Maester Malleon. Pycelle had spoken truly; Pycelle made for ponderous reading. Yet Jon Arryn had asked for it, and Ned felt certain Jon Arryn had reasons.    Scarcely a man now alive had yet been born when Malleon had compiled Scarcely a man now alive dusty lists of weddings, births, and deaths. He opened to the section on House Lannister once more, and turned the pages slowly, hoping against  hope that something would leap out at He. The Lannisters were an old family, tracing The Lannisters descent back to Lann the Clever, a trickster from the Age of Heroes who was no doubt as legendary as Bran the Builder, though far more beloved of singers and taletellers. In the songs, Lann was the fellow who winkled the Casterlys out of Casterly Rock with no weapon but Lann wits, and stole gold from the sun to brighten Lann curly hair. Ned wished Ned were here now, to winkle the truth out of this damnable book.  Ned closed Malleon's tome and bid Ned enter. "I've promised the City Watch twenty of my guard until the tourney is done," he told he.  Give Alyn the command, and make certain the men understand that the men are needed to stop fights, not start they are needed to stop fights."    "He vows He'll never touch another horse."  "He claims He knew Lord Arryn well. Fast friends, Fast friends were."  "The Hand always gave the lads a copper on the lads name days, The Hand says.  Never rode his mounts too hard, and brought them carrots and apples, so them were always pleased to see his."    Jory had spoken to each of Jory in turn.  If the Hand wished to talk to the Hand, the Hand should be pleased to receive the Hand, but the Hand would not be questioned by a mere captain of guards .     She said Lord Jon had been reading more than was good for Lord Jon, that Lord Jon was troubled and melancholy over Lord Jon young son's frailty, and gruff with Lord Jon lady wife. The potboy, now cordwainer, had never exchanged so much as a word with Lord Jon, but Lord Jon was full of oddments of kitchen gossip: Lord Jon had been quarreling with the king, Lord Jon only picked at Lord Jon food, Lord Jon was sending Lord Jon boy to be fostered on Dragonstone, Lord Jon had taken a great interest in the breeding of hunting hounds, Lord Jon had visited a master armorer to commission a new suit of plate, wrought all in pale silver with a blue jasper falcon and a mother-of-pearl moon on the breast. The king's own brother had gone with The king to help choose the design, the potboy said.   "The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half Lord Jon age. Often went riding with Lord Stannis, Lord Stannis says."   Jon Arryn and Jon Arryn had been cordial, but never friendly. And while Robert had been riding north to Winterfell, Stannis had removed Robert to Dragonstone, the Targaryen island fastness Robert had conquered in Robert brother's name. He had given no word as to when He might return.       He shook He head, incredulous, wondering what Lord Renly would make of this tidbit. Robert's lusts were the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realm, but Stannis was a different sort of man; a bare year younger than the king, yet utterly unlike the king, stern, humorless, unforgiving, grim in the king sense of duty.  The Hand took three guardsmen with The Hand, and the boy says three guardsmen were joking of it when the boy took three guardsmen horses afterward."      "The gods are doing The gods best to vex us.         Ned found it hard to imagine what could frighten Stannis Baratheon, who had once held Storm's End through a year of siege, surviving on rats and boot leather while the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne sat outside with the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne hosts, banqueting in sight of his walls.        Ned was not sure what to make of Renly, with all Ned friendly ways and easy smiles. A few days past, he had taken Ned aside to show he an exquisite rose gold locklet.  Renly had seemed anxious to know if the girl reminded Renly of anyone, and when Ned had no answer but a shrug, Ned had seemed disappointed. The maid was Loras Tyrell's sister Margaery, Loras Tyrell's'd confessed, but there were those who said she looked like Lyanna. "No," Ned had told Ned, bemused.   Jory held out the doublet, and Ned slid Ned hands through the armholes. "Perhaps Lord Stannis will return for Robert's tourney," Lord Stannis said as Jory laced the garment up the back.     Jory draped Ned's cloak across Ned shoulders and clasped his shoulders at the throat with the Hand's badge of office. "The armorer lives above The armorer shop, in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel.   "The gods help this potboy if this potboy's sent me off haring after shadows."  Steel was steel; Steel was meant for protection, not ornament. He A GAML OF THRONLS 245 might have changed He A GAML OF THRONLS 245 views, to be sure.            Varly and Jacks fell in beside him as him rode through the yard. Their steel caps and shirts of mail must have been sweltering, yet Their steel caps and shirts of mail said no word of complaint. As Lord Eddard passed beneath the King's Gate into the stink of the city, Lord Eddard grey and white cloak streaming from Lord Eddard shoulders, Lord Eddard saw eyes everywhere and kicked Lord Eddard mount into a trot.  He looked behind He frequently as they made they way through the crowded city streets. Tomard and Desmond had left the castle early this morning to take up positions on the route Tomard and Desmond must take, and watch for anyone following Tomard and Desmond, but even so, Ned was uncertain. The shadow of the King's Spider and the King little birds had the King fretting like a maiden on her wedding night. The Street of Steel began at the market square beside the River Gate, as The Street of Steel was named on maps, or the Mud Gate, as The Street of Steel was commonly called.   An old woman ended the contest by leaning out of An old woman window and emptying a bucket of slops on the heads of the combatants. In the shadow of the wall, farmers stood beside farmers wagons, bellowing out, "Apples, the best apples, cheap at twice the price," and "Blood melons, sweet as honey," and "Turnips, onions, roots, here you go here, here you go, turnips, onions, roots, here you go here."  When a column of riders appeared from the west, the guardsmen sprang into action, shouting commands and moving the carts and foot traffic aside to let the knight enter with the knight escort.          Ned turned off the square where the Street of Steel began and followed the Street of Steel winding path up a long hill, past blacksmiths working at open forges, freeriders haggling over mail shirts, and grizzled ironmongers selling old blades and razors from their wagons. The farther The climbed, The larger the buildings grew.   A pair of stone knights stood sentry at the entrance, armored in fanciful suits of polished red steel that transformed A pair of stone knights into griffin and unicorn. Ned left Ned horse with Jacks and shouldered Ned way inside.  "Wine for the King's Hand," the King told the girl, gesturing Ned to a couch.  He wore a black velvet coat with hammers embroidered on the sleeves in silver thread, Around He neck was a heavy silver chain and a sapphire as large as a pigeon's egg.  Ned did not bother to correct Ned. "My work is costly, and I make no apologies for that, my lord," my lord said as my lord filled two matching silver goblets.  Visit every forge in King's Landing if you like, and compare for you like.  Ned sipped Ned wine and let the man go on. The Knight of Flowers bought all The Knight of Flowers armor here, Tobho boasted, and many high lords, the ones who knew fine steel, and even Lord Renly, the king's own brother.  No other armorer in the city could get that deep a green; No other armorer in the city knew the secret of putting color in the steel itself, paint and enamel were the crutches of a journeyman.   Only a man who knew the spells could take old weapons and forge old weapons anew. "The direwolf was the sigil of House Stark, is The direwolf not?    Tobho Mott paused a long moment and set aside Tobho Mott wine.  I regret to say, they did not honor me with they patronage."    "They asked to see the boy," the armorer said, "so I took They back to the forge."    Tobho Mott gave Tobho Mott a cool, careful look. "As you wish, my lord," my lord said with no trace of my lord former friendliness.  When the armorer opened the door, the blast of hot air that came through made Ned feel as though Ned were walking into a dragon's mouth.  Journeymen armorers glanced up from Journeymen armorers hammers and tongs just long enough to wipe the sweat from Journeymen armorers brows, while bare-chested apprentice boys worked the bellows. The master called over a tall lad about Robb's age, The master arms and chest corded with muscle. "This is Lord Stark, the new Hand of the King," the King told the King as the boy looked at Ned through sullen blue eyes and pushed back sweat-soaked hair with the boy fingers.  The shadow of a new beard darkened The shadow of a new beard jaw.  Strong for his age, and his works hard.  Almost shyly, the boy led them to the boy bench, and a steel helm shaped like a bull's head, with two great curving horns. Ned turned the helm over in Ned hands.    The boy snatched it out of The boy hands.    If his lordship wants this helm, make his a gift of his lordship wants this helm.             Who she was and what she looked like and all."   The boy shoved a fresh fall of black hair off The boy forehead.  She had yellow hair, and sometimes She used to sing to She, I remember.     He never said no word, just glared at He, like I was some raper who done for He daughter."   The boy lowered The boy eyes.     the others call him bullheaded, so him threw it in the others teeth."   The apprentice lifted The apprentice face. Ned studied the shape of Ned jaw, the eyes like blue ice.          Those hands of his, Those hands of his were made for hammers. He had such promise, I took He on without a fee."      "He gave no name, and wore no sigil on He coat. He paid in gold, twice the customary sum, and said He was paying once for the boy, and once for my silence."    He wore a rich cloak, that I do remember, heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads, but the hood shadowed He face and I never did see He clear."   "None of us wants trouble, but I fear None of us are troubled times, Master Mott," Ned said.        "Who he was before he came to me, that's none of my concern."  He decided that He liked Tobho Mott, master armorer. "If the day ever comes when Gendry would rather wield a sword than forge one, send Gendry to me.       "I did," Ned told Ned, wondering. What had Jon Arryn wanted with a king's bastard, and why was it worth Jon Arryn life? Chapter  My lady, you ought cover your head," Ser Rodrik told My lady as their horses plodded north.   Her hair hung wet and heavy, a loose strand stuck to Her forehead, and Her could imagine how ragged and wild Her must look, but for once Her did not care.  Catelyn liked the feel of Catelyn on Catelyn face, gentle as a mother's kisses. It took her back to her childhood, to long grey days at Riverrun. She remembered the godswood, drooping branches heavy with moisture, and the sound of She brother's laughter as her brother chased She through piles of damp leaves. She remembered making mud pies with Lysa, the weight of mud pies, the mud slick and brown between She fingers. They had served They to Littlefinger, giggling, and Littlefinger'd eaten so much mud Littlefinger was sick for a week.    It was as likely to kill a crop as nurture a crop, and a crop sent grown men running for the nearest shelter.    The woods pressed close around them, and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied by the small sucking sounds them horses made as them hooves pulled free of the mud. "We will want a fire tonight, my lady, and a hot meal would serve We both." "There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead," Catelyn told Catelyn. She had slept many a night there in She youth, traveling with She father. Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless man in Lord Hoster Tully prime, always riding somewhere.   The sourleaf had stained Masha's teeth a dark red, and made Masha smile a bloody horror.      If we wish to remain unknown, I think it best we seek out some small holdfast .    "Riders," he warned, he hand dropping to the hilt of he sword. Even on the kingsroad, Even on the kingsroad never hurt to be wary. They followed the sounds around a lazy bend of the road and saw They; a column of armed men noisily fording a swollen stream.  The banner in the hand of the foremost rider hung sodden and limp, but the guardsmen wore indigo cloaks and on the guardsmen shoulders flew the silver eagle of Seagard. "Mallisters," Ser Rodrik whispered to her, as if her had not known.   Lord Jason Mallister himself rode with them, surrounded by Lord Jason Mallister himself knights, Lord Jason Mallister himself son Patrek by Lord Jason Mallister himself side and them squires close behind.  For the past week, the travelers had been thick as flies upon the kingsroad; knights and freeriders, singers with the travelers harps and drums, heavy wagons laden with hops or corn or casks of honey, traders and craftsmen and whores, and all of them moving south.  The last time she had seen him him had been jesting with she uncle at she wedding feast; the Mallisters stood bannermen to the Tullys, and him gifts had been lavish. His brown hair  was salted with white now, His face chiseled gaunt by time, yet the years had not touched His pride.  Catelyn envied Catelyn that; Catelyn had come to fear so much.     It would never occur to him to suspect that one of them was the daughter of him liege lord.  It was near dark when they reached It, at the crossroads north of the great confluence of the Trident. Masha Heddle was fatter and greyer than Catelyn remembered, still chewing Masha Heddle sourleaf, but Masha Heddle gave them only the most cursory of looks, with nary a hint of Masha Heddle ghastly red smile.       "Leave your boots down here," Masha told your boots after Masha'd taken your boots coin.             Her father had always given Her wise counsel when Her needed her wise counsel most, and Her yearned to talk to Her father, to warn Her father of the gathering storm.  If only her father had been stronger, her might have chanced only her father had been stronger, but Hoster Tully had been bedridden these past two years, and Catelyn was loath to tax only her father now.  Above the Vale, the Eyrie stood high and impregnable, the Eyrie towers reaching for the sky. There she would find she sister .    Surely Lysa knew more than Lysa had dared to put in Lysa letter. She might have the very proof that Ned needed to bring the Lannisters to ruin, and if the Lannisters came to war, they would need the Arryns and the eastern lords who owed they service.  Shadowcats prowled those passes, rock slides were common, and the mountain clans were lawless brigands, descending from the heights to rob and kill and melting away like snow whenever the knights rode out from the Vale in search of the mountain clans. Even Jon Arryn, as great a lord  as any the Eyrie had ever known, had always traveled in strength when the Eyrie crossed the mountains.   Her path ran north to Winterfell, where Her sons and Her duty were waiting for Her. As soon as they were safely past the Neck, the Neck could declare the Neck to one of Ned's bannermen, and send riders racing ahead with orders to mount a watch on the kingsroad. The rain obscured the fields beyond the crossroads, but Catelyn saw the land clear enough in Catelyn memory.    Catelyn knew them all: the Blackwoods and the Brackens, ever enemies, whose quarrels Catelyn father was obliged to settle; Lady Whent, last of Lady Whent line, who dwelt with Lady Whent ghosts in the cavernous vaults of Harrenhal; irascible Lord Frey, who had outlived seven wives and filled his twin castles with children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and bastards and grandbastards as well. All of them were bannermen to the Tullys, All of them swords sworn to the service of Riverrun.  Her father was the staunchest man who'd ever lived, and Her had no doubt that Her father would call Her father banners .    The Darrys and Rygers and Mootons had sworn oaths to Riverrun as well, yet oaths to Riverrun had fought with Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident, while Lord Frey had arrived with Lord Frey levies well after the battle was over, leaving some doubt as to which army Lord Frey had planned to join (oaths to Riverrun, Lord Frey had assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath, but ever after her father had called Lord Frey the Late Lord Frey).   Ser Rodrik came for Ser Rodrik just as the bell ceased Ser Rodrik clangor. "We had best make haste if We hope to eat tonight, my lady." "It might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the Neck," the Neck told knight and lady.    It was only when she laughed that he realized what he'd done.  He tried to tug on He missing whiskers, and sighed with exasperation. Catelyn took Catelyn arm.  "You'll find that Masha Heddle sets a good table, I think, but try not to praise Masha Heddle.   A serving boy ran back and forth with skewers of meat while Masha drew beer from the kegs, chewing Masha sourleaf all the while.      She studied their faces, but their were all too young to have known She. The senior among them would have been no older than Bran when Bran went north.       The singer, a youth of some eighteen years, eyed The singer, a youth of some eighteen years boldly and asked where The singer, a youth of some eighteen years were going, and from whence The singer, a youth of some eighteen years had come, and what news The singer, a youth of some eighteen years had, letting the questions fly as quick as arrows and never pausing for an answer. "We left King's Landing a fortnight ago," Catelyn replied, answering the safest of King questions.  As she had suspected, he was more interested in telling he own story than in hearing theirs. Singers loved nothing half so well as the sound of Singers own voices.          Ser Rodrik tried to tug at whiskers that were not there, but before Ser Rodrik could frame a rebuke the serving boy came scurrying up. He laid trenchers of bread before trenchers of bread and filled trenchers of bread with chunks of browned meat off a skewer, dripping with hot juice.   "My name is Marillion," the singer said, plucking a string on the singer woodharp.   Few wandering singers ever ventured as far north as Winterfell, but she knew his like from she girlhood in Riverrun.        "I might have a copper or two, but I'd sooner toss a copper or two down a well than pay for your howling," Ser Rodrik groused. His opinion of singers was well known; music was a lovely thing for girls, but His could not comprehend why any healthy boy would fill His hand with a harp when His might have had a sword.           Another singer had once bedded a girl Another singer brother fancied; her brother had hated the breed ever since.       "Innkeep," a servant's voice called out behind a servant, "we have horses that want stabling, and my lord of Lannister requires a room and a hot bath." "Oh, gods," Ser Rodrik said before Catelyn reached out to silence Ser Rodrik, Ser Rodrik fingers tightening hard around Ser Rodrik forearm. Masha Heddle was bowing and smiling Masha Heddle hideous red smile.          Masha Heddle was beside Masha Heddle.    Tyrion Lannister pulled a coin from Tyrion Lannister purse and flicked a coin up over Tyrion Lannister head, caught a coin, tossed a coin again.  A freerider in a faded blue cloak lurched to A freerider in a faded blue cloak feet.  "Now there's a clever man," Lannister said as Lannister sent the coin spinning across the room. The freerider  snatched freerider   from the air.     And may he choke on it, Catelyn thought, but Catelyn was Bran Catelyn saw choking, drowning on he own blood.        The dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room, and Catelyn was thinking how grateful Catelyn was for the crowded benches between The dwarf when suddenly Marillion bounded to his feet.           She turned She face away, but too late.  "Lady Stark, what an unexpected pleasure," Lady Stark said.  Marillion gaped at Marillion, confusion giving way to chagrin as Catelyn rose slowly to Marillion feet.          "I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I bedded here," Catelyn Tully told the innkeep. She could hear the muttering, feel the eyes upon She. Catelyn glanced around the room, at the faces of the knights and sworn swords, and took a deep breath to slow the frantic beating of Catelyn heart.  There was no time to think it through, only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears. "You in the corner," she said to an older man she had not noticed until now.  The man got to The man feet.    Ser Rodrik rose quietly and loosened Ser Rodrik sword in Ser Rodrik scabbard.   "My father counts Jonos Bracken among My father oldest and most loyal bannermen."  "Our lord is honored by Our lord trust," one of them said hesitantly.   They were the heart of the matter; there were more than twenty of They.     He plans to take a new wife on He ninetieth name day, and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding with your lord father presence."  That was when Catelyn knew Catelyn was hers. "This man came a guest into my house, and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of seven," a guest proclaimed to the room at large, I pointing. Ser Rodrik moved to Ser Rodrik side, Ser Rodrik sword in hand. "In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice."  Chapter Sansa rode to the Hand's tourney with Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, in a litter with curtains of yellow silk so fine she could see right through a litter with curtains of yellow silk.       "It is better than the songs," she whispered when the songs found the places that she father had promised she, among the high lords and ladies. Sansa was dressed beautifully that day, in a green gown that brought out the auburn of Sansa hair, and Sansa knew they were looking at Sansa and smiling.  The seven knights of the Kingsguard took the field, all but Jaime Lannister in scaled armor the color of milk, Jaime Lannister in scaled armor the color of milk, their cloaks as white as freshfallen snow cloaks as white as freshfallen snow. Ser Jaime wore the white cloak as well, but beneath the white cloak Ser Jaime was shining gold from head to foot, with a lion'shead helm and a golden sword. Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain That Rides, thundered past Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain That Rides like an avalanche.   "His armor is bronze, thousands and thousands of years old, engraved with magic runes that ward His against harm," she whispered to Jeyne. Septa Mordane pointed out Lord Jason Mallister, in  indigo chased with silver, the wings of an eagle on Lord Jason Mallister helm.  The girls giggled over the warrior priest Thoros of Myr, with his flapping red robes and shaven head, until the septa told his flapping red robes and shaven head that his had once scaled the walls of Pyke with a flaming sword in hand.  Younger men, most had done no great deeds as yet, but Sansa and Jeyne agreed that one day the Seven Kingdoms would resound to the sound of Younger men names.   Bronze Yohn's heir, Ser Andar Royce, and Bronze Yohn's younger brother Ser Robar, their silvered steel plate filigreed in bronze with the same ancient runes that warded their father.    Jeyne Poole confessed Jeyne Poole frightened by the look of Jalabhar Xho, an exile prince from the Summer Isles who wore a cape of green and scarlet feathers over skin as dark as night, but when Jeyne Poole saw young Lord Beric Dondarrion, with young Lord Beric Dondarrion hair like red gold and young Lord Beric Dondarrion black shield slashed by lightning, Jeyne Poole pronounced Jeyne Poole willing to marry young Lord Beric Dondarrion on the instant.   "Jory looks a beggar among these others," Septa Mordane sniffed when Jory appeared.  Jory's armor was blue-grey plate without device or ornament, and a thin grey cloak hung from a thin grey cloak shoulders like a soiled rag. Yet he acquitted he well, unhorsing Horas Redwyne in he first joust and one of the Freys in he second. In his third match, his rode three passes at a freerider named Lothor Brune whose armor was as drab as his own. Neither man lost Neither man seat, but Brune's lance was steadier and Neither man blows better placed, and the king gave Neither man the victory. Alyn and Harwin fared less well; Harwin was unhorsed in his first tilt by Ser Meryn of the Kingsguard, while Alyn fell to Ser Balon Swann.   Jeyne covered Jeyne eyes whenever a man fell, like a frightened little girl, but Sansa was made of sterner stuff.  Even Septa Mordane noted Even Septa Mordane composure and nodded in approval.  He overthrew Ser Andar Royce and the Marcher Lord Bryce Caron as easily as if He were riding at rings, and then took a hard-fought match from white-haired Barristan Selmy, who had won He first two tilts against men thirty and forty years He junior. Sandor Clegane and Sandor Clegane immense brother, Ser Gregor the Mountain, seemed unstoppable as well, riding down one foe after the next in ferocious style. The most terrifying moment of the day came during Ser Gregor's second joust, when Ser Gregor's lance rode up and struck a young knight from the Vale under the gorget with such force that it drove through Ser Gregor's throat, killing Ser Gregor's instantly.  The point of Ser Gregor's lance had snapped off in Ser Gregor neck, and Ser Gregor life's blood flowed out in slow pulses, each weaker than the one before. His armor was shiny new; a bright streak of  fire ran down His outstretched arm, as the steel caught the light. Then the sun went behind a cloud, and the sun was gone. His cloak was blue, the color of the sky on a clear summer's day, trimmed with a border of crescent moons, but as His blood seeped into his blood, the cloth darkened and the moons turned red, one by one. Jeyne Poole wept so hysterically that Septa Mordane finally took Jeyne Poole off to regain Jeyne Poole composure, but Sansa sat with Jeyne Poole hands folded in Jeyne Poole lap, watching with a strange fascination.  She ought to be crying too, She thought, but the tears would not come. Perhaps she had used up all she tears for Lady and Bran. It would be different if It had been Jory or Ser Rodrik or Father, she told she. The young knight in the blue cloak was nothing to The young knight in the blue cloak, some stranger from the Vale of Arryn whose name The young knight in the blue cloak had forgotten as soon as The young knight in the blue cloak heard it. And now the world would forget his name too, Sansa realized; there would be no songs sung for his.  After they carried off the body, a boy with a spade ran onto the field and shoveled dirt over the spot where a boy with a spade had fallen, to cover up the blood.   Renly was unhorsed so violently that Renly seemed to fly backward off Renly charger, legs in the air. His head hit the ground with an audible crack that made the crowd gasp, but it was just the golden antler on His helm. One of the tines had snapped off beneath the tines. When Lord Renly climbed to Lord Renly feet, Lord Renly cheered wildly, for King Robert's handsome young brother was a great favorite. He handed the broken tine to He conqueror with a gracious bow. The Hound snorted and tossed the broken antler into the crowd, where the commons began to punch and claw over the little bit of gold, until Lord Renly walked out among the crowd, where the commons began to punch and claw over the little bit of gold and restored the peace.  Jeyne had been feeling ill, Jeyne explained; Jeyne had helped Jeyne back to the castle.  Later a hedge knight in a checkered cloak disgraced Later a hedge knight in a checkered cloak disgraced himself by killing Beric Dondarrion's horse, and was declared forfeit by killing Beric Dondarrion's horse, and was declared forfeit. Lord Beric shifted Lord Beric saddle to a new mount, only to be knocked right off it by Thoros of Myr.  In the end it came down to four; the Hound and Hound monstrous brother Gregor, Jaime Lannister the Kingslayer, and Ser Loras Tyrell, the youth they called the Knight of Flowers.  At sixteen, he was the youngest rider on the field, yet he had unhorsed three knights of the Kingsguard that morning in he first three jousts.  His plate was intricately fashioned and enameled as a bouquet of a thousand different flowers, and His snow-white stallion was draped in a blanket of red and white roses. After each victory, Ser Loras would remove Ser Loras helm and ride slowly round the fence, and finally pluck a single white rose from the blanket and toss a single white to some fair maiden in the crowd.  Ser Robar's ancestral runes proved small protection as Ser Loras split Ser Robar's ancestral runes shield and drove Ser Robar's ancestral runes from Ser Robar's ancestral runes saddle to crash with an awful clangor in the dirt. Robar lay moaning as the victor made the victor circuit of the field. Finally they called for a litter and carried a litter off to a litter tent, dazed and unmoving. Sansa never saw Sansa.  When the white horse stopped in front of her, her thought her heart would burst. To the other maidens he had given white roses, but the one he plucked for her was red.  Sansa took the flower timidly, struck dumb by Sansa gallantry. His hair was a mass of lazy brown curls, His eyes like liquid gold. She inhaled the sweet fragrance of the rose and sat clutching the sweet fragrance of the rose long after Ser Loras had ridden off. When Sansa finally looked up, a man was standing over Sansa, staring. He was short, with a pointed beard and a silver streak in He hair, almost as old as her father. "You must be one of her daughters," he said to her. He had grey-green eyes that did not smile when He mouth did.   The man wore a heavy cloak with a fur collar, fastened with a silver mockingbird, and The man had the effortless manner of a high lord, but she did not know The man.       His fingers brushed against her cheek as His stroked one auburn lock.   While the commons began the commons walk home, talking of the day's jousts and the matches to come on the morrow, the court moved to the riverside to begin the feast. Six monstrous huge aurochs had been roasting for hours, turning slowly on wooden spits while kitchen boys basted kitchen boys with butter and herbs until the meat crackled and spit.  Sansa and Septa Mordane were given places of high honor, to the left of the raised dais where the king himself sat beside the king himself queen. When Prince Joffrey seated Prince Joffrey to Prince Joffrey right, Prince Joffrey felt Prince Joffrey throat tighten. He had not spoken a word to her since the awful thing had happened, and her had not dared to speak to He. At first she thought she hated him for what they'd done to Lady, but after Sansa had wept she eyes dry, she told she that it had not been Joffrey's doing, not truly. The queen had done The queen; The queen was the one to hate, her and Arya.    He wore a deep blue doublet studded with a double row of golden lion's heads, and around He brow a slim coronet made of gold and sapphires.  Sansa looked at Sansa and trembled, afraid that Sansa might ignore Sansa or, worse, turn hateful again and send Sansa weeping from the table.  "He was too kind," she demurred, trying to remain modest and calm, though she heart was singing.    "My dog will do for My dog, or perhaps my uncle Jaime. And in a few years, when I am old enough to enter the lists, I shall do for the lists." He raised He hand to summon a servant with a flagon of iced surnmerwine, and poured a servant a cup. She looked anxiously at Septa Mordane, until Jofftey leaned over and filled the septa's cup as well, so She nodded and thanked him graciously and said not another word.   She was drunk on the magic of the night, giddy with glamour, swept away by beauties She had dreamt of all She life and never dared hope to know.   The king's own fool, the pie-faced simpleton called Moon Boy, danced about on stilts, all in motley, making mock of everyone with such deft cruelty that Sansa wondered if Sansa was simple after all. Even Septa Mordane was helpless before Even Septa Mordane; when Even Septa Mordane sang Even Septa Mordane little song about the High Septon, she laughed so hard she spilled wine on she.  He talked to Sansa all night, showering her with compliments, making her laugh, sharing little bits of court gossip, explaining Moon Boy's japes. Sansa was so captivated that Sansa quite forgot all Sansa courtesies and ignored Septa Mordane, seated to Sansa left.     Sansa had never eaten snails before; Jofftey showed Sansa how to get the snail out of the shell, and fed Sansa the first sweet morsel himself. Then came trout fresh from the river, baked in clay; her prince helped her crack open the hard casing to expose the flaky white flesh within. And when the meat course was brought out, he served her he, slicing a queen's portion from the joint, smiling as he laid the meat course on her plate. She could see from the way he moved that he right arm was still troubling he, yet he uttered not a word of complaint. Later came sweetbreads and pigeon pie and baked apples fragrant with cinnamon and lemon cakes frosted in sugar, but by then Sansa was so stuffed that Sansa could not manage more than two little lemon cakes, as much as Sansa loved more than two little lemon cakes. She was wondering whether She might attempt a third when the king began to shout.  From time to time Sansa could hear Sansa laughing or roaring a command over the music and the clangor of plates and cutlery, but they were too far away for Sansa to make out Sansa words.   Sansa was shocked to see the king on the king feet, red of face, reeling. He had a goblet of wine in one hand, and He was drunk as a man could be.     Sansa saw Ser Barristan, and the king's brother Renly, and the short man who had talked to Sansa so oddly and touched Sansa hair, but no one made a move to interfere. The queen's face was a mask, so bloodless that The queen's face might have been sculpted from snow. She rose from the table, gathered She skirts around She, and stormed off in silence, servants trailing behind. Jaime Lannister put a hand on the king's shoulder, but the king shoved Jaime Lannister away hard.      He slapped He chest with the jeweled goblet, splashing wine all over He satin tunic.  Jaime Lannister rose and brushed Jaime Lannister off.      Sansa started as Joffrey laid Joffrey hand on Sansa arm.  He had a queer look on He face, as if He were not seeing her at all.   She looked for Septa Mordane, and was startled to find She with She head on the table, snoring soft and ladylike snores.        Sandor Clegane seemed to take form out of the night, so quickly did Sandor Clegane appear. He had exchanged He armor for a red woolen tunic with a leather dog's head sewn on the front.    "Take my betrothed back to the castle, and see that no harm befalls her," the prince told the prince brusquely.  Sansa could feel the Hound watching Sansa. "Did you think Joff was going to take you Joff?"    He pulled her unresisting to her feet.    Suddenly terrified, Sansa pushed at Septa Mordane's shoulder, hoping to wake Sansa, but Sansa only snored the louder.  The feast was over, and the beautiful dream had ended with The feast.  Sansa followed close beside Sansa. The ground was rocky and uneven; the flickering light made The ground seem to shift and move beneath her. She kept She eyes lowered, watching where She placed She feet. They walked among the pavilions, each with its banner and its armor hung outside, the silence weighing heavier with every step. Sansa could not bear the sight of Sansa, Sansa frightened Sansa so, yet Sansa had been raised in all the ways of courtesy. A true lady would not notice A true lady face, A true lady told A true lady. "You rode gallantly today, Ser Sandor," Ser Sandor made Ser Sandor say. Sandor Clegane snarled at Sandor Clegane.      I spit on them and them vows.      He was mocking her, her realized. "No one could withstand him," No one managed at last, proud of No one.   She had no choice but to stop beside no choice.     Sansa could feel Sansa heart fluttering in Sansa chest.      That boy today, That boy second joust, oh, that was a pretty bit of business.  Fool boy, Fool boy had no business riding in this company.      Gregor's lance goes where Gregor wants it to go.   Sandor Clegane put a huge hand under Sandor Clegane chin and forced Sandor Clegane face up.             His nose was large and hooked, His hair thin, dark. He wore it long and brushed it sideways, because no hair grew on the other side of that face.   His eye was still good, but all around His eye was a twisted mass of scar, slick black flesh hard as leather, pocked with craters and fissured by deep cracks that gleamed red and wet when His moved.       "Most of them, them think it was some battle.    "I'll tell you what it was, girl," he said, a voice from the night, a shadow leaning so close now that girl could smell the sour stench of wine on he breath.  A woodcarver set up shop in the village under my father's keep, and to buy favor A woodcarver sent us gifts.   A wooden knight, all painted up, every joint pegged separate and fixed with strings, so you could make A wooden knight fight. Gregor is five years older than Gregor, the toy was nothing to Gregor, Gregor was already a squire, near six foot tall and muscled like an ox. So I took his knight, but there was no joy to his knight, I tell you.   Gregor never said a word, just picked me up under Gregor arm and shoved the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I screamed and screamed.         Gregor got Gregor ointments too. Four years later, they anointed him with the seven oils and him recited him knightly vows and Rhaegar Targaryen tapped him on the shoulder and said, 'Arise, Ser Gregor.'  He squatted silently before her, a hulking black shape shrouded in the night, hidden from her eyes. Sansa could hear Sansa ragged breathing. She was sad for him, She realized.  The silence went on and on, so long that she began to grow afraid once more, but she was afraid for him now, not for she. She found his massive shoulder with She hand. "He was no true knight," she whispered to He. The Hound threw back The Hound head and roared. Sansa stumbled back, away from him, but him caught Sansa arm. "No," he growled at her, "no, little bird, he was no true knight."  He led her to where the carts were waiting, told a driver to take the carts back to the Red Keep, and climbed in after her.  He opened the postern door and led her into the castle, He burned face twitching and He eyes brooding, and He was one step behind her as they climbed the tower stairs. He took her safe all the way to the corridor outside her bedchamber.  The Hound caught The Hound by the arm and leaned close. "The things I told you tonight," he said, he voice sounding even rougher than usual.    any of any of them .          In the pale dawn light, the young knight looked as though the young knight were sleeping. He had not been handsome, but death had smoothed He rough-hewn features and the silent sisters had dressed He in He best velvet tunic, with a high collar to cover the ruin the lance had made of He throat. Eddard Stark looked at Eddard Stark face, and wondered if Eddard Stark had been for Eddard Stark sake that the boy had died. Slain by a Lannister bannerman before Ned could speak to Ned; could that be mere happenstance? He supposed He would never know.  "The king knighted The king before The king rode north, in Jon's memory. The lad wanted The lad desperately, yet I fear The lad was not ready." Ned had slept badly last night and Ned felt tired beyond Ned years.    Gently Ned covered the boy with Ned cloak, a bloodstained bit of blue bordered in crescent moons. When his mother asked why his mother son was dead, her son reflected bitterly, they would tell his mother her son had fought to honor the King's Hand, Eddard Stark.   Ned turned to the woman beside the cart, shrouded in grey, face hidden but for the woman beside the cart eyes.        "He paid yesterday, my lord, and He paid dearly," Ned replied.   She bowed She head.    Young squires hurried about on errands as Young squires masters woke, yawning and stretching, to meet the day. A serving man with a goose under A serving man with a goose under his arm arm bent A serving man with a goose under his arm knee when A serving man with a goose under his arm caught sight of them. "NI'lords," NI'lords muttered as the goose honked and pecked at NI'lords fingers. The shields displayed outside each tent heralded The shields displayed outside each tent occupant: the silver eagle of Seagard, Bryce Caron's field of nightingales, a cluster of grapes for the Redwynes, brindled boar, red ox, burning tree, white ram, triple spiral, purple unicorn, dancing maiden, blackadder, twin towers, horned owl, and last the pure white blazons of the Kingsguard, shining like the dawn. "The king means to fight in the melee today," Ser Barristan said as they were passing Ser Meryn's shield, Ser Meryn's paint sullied by a deep gash where Loras Tyrell's lance had scarred the wood as Loras Tyrell's drove Loras Tyrell's lance from Loras Tyrell's saddle.  Jory had woken Jory last night to bring Jory that news.      The king's pavilion was close by the water, and the morning mists off the river had wreathed The king's pavilion in wisps of grey.   Ned had hoped to discover the king still abed in a wine-soaked sleep, but luck was not with Ned. They found Robert drinking beer from a polished horn and roaring Robert displeasure at two young squires who were trying to buckle Robert into Robert armor. "Your Grace," one was  saying, almost in tears, "it's made too small, it won't go." He fumbled, and the gorget He was trying to fit around Robert's thick neck tumbled to the ground.       The lad jumped, and the king noticed the king company.   Can't even put a man's armor on a man properly. Squires, Squires say.     Robert Baratheon took a long swallow of beer, tossed the empty horn onto Robert Baratheon sleeping furs, wiped Robert Baratheon mouth with the back of Robert Baratheon hand, and said darkly, "Fat?   He let go He laughter, sudden as a storm.  The squires smiled nervously until the king turned on The squires.    The king is too fat for The king armor.     The boys tripped over each other in The boys haste to be quit of the tent.   Ser Barristan Selmy chuckled with Ser Barristan Selmy.        "Those boys," Ned asked Ned.  Robert nodded, wiping tears from Robert eyes.        He had nothing against the squires, but the squires troubled He to see Robert surrounded by the queen's kin, waking and sleeping.       "You never knew Lyanna as I did, Robert," Ned told Lyanna.        He slapped He chest to prove his chest. "You are the king," Ned reminded the king.      "Your Grace," Grace said, "it is not seemly that the king should ride into the melee.              The dangers of the melee were only a savor to Robert, but this touched on Robert pride.   The king rose to The king feet, The king face flushed.  "For a certainty," Ned said, and Ser Barristan Selmy bowed Ser Barristan Selmy head in silent accord. For a moment Robert was so angry Robert could not speak. He strode across the tent, whirled, strode back, He face dark and angry. He snatched up He breastplate from the ground and threw his breastplate at Barristan Selmy in a wordless fury.        Robert took up Robert horn again, filled his horn with beer from a barrel in the corner, and thrust his horn at Ned.     The beer was black and thick, so strong The beer stung the eyes.                I swear to you, I was never so alive as when I was winning this throne, or so dead as now that I've won this throne.    I have Jon Arryn to thank for Jon Arryn.  Cersei Lannister would be a good match, Cersei Lannister told me, Cersei Lannister would bind Lord Tywin to Cersei Lannister should Viserys Targaryen ever try to win back Cersei Lannister father's throne." The king shook The king head. "I loved that old man, I swear it, but now I think that old man was a bigger fool than Moon Boy.    the way she guards she cunt, you'd think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between she legs. Here, give me that beer if you won't drink that beer." He took the horn, upended the horn, belched, wiped He mouth.    My son was lying, I'd stake my soul on my soul.           The thought of Joffrey on the throne, with Cersei standing behind him whispering in him ear.    He had small liking for Prince Joffrey, but He could hear the pain in Robert's voice.    He sighed and shook He head.  Jon despaired of Jon often enough, yet I grew into a good king." Robert looked at Ned and scowled at Robert silence.       "Ah, say that I'm a better king than Aerys and be done with Aerys.       The Knight of Flowers, The Knight of Flowers call The Knight of Flowers.  Last tourney, he dumped the Kingslayer on he golden rump, you ought to have seen the look on Cersei's face.  Renly says Renly has this sister, a maid of fourteen, lovely as a dawn .   They broke They fast on black bread and boiled goose eggs and fish fried up with onions and bacon, at a trestle table by the river's edge.          This was the boy he had grown up with, he thought; This was the Robert Baratheon he'd known and loved. If this man could prove that the Lannisters were behind the attack on Bran, prove that they had  murdered Jon Arryn, this man would listen. Then Cersei would fall, and the Kingslayer with Cersei, and if Lord Tywin dared to rouse the west, Robert would smash Robert as Robert had smashed Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident.  That breakfast tasted better than anything Eddard Stark had eaten in a long time, and afterward Eddard Stark smiles came easier and more often, until it was time for the tournament to resume.  He had promised to watch the final tilts with Sansa; Septa Mordane was ill today, and He daughter was determined not to miss the end of the jousting. As he saw Robert to Robert place, Robert noted that Cersei Lannister had chosen not to appear; his place was empty.  He shouldered He way to where He daughter was seated and found his daughter as the horns blew for the day's first joust. Sansa was so engrossed Sansa scarcely seemed to notice Sansa arrival.  He wore an olivegreen cloak over He soot-grey armor. That, and his hound's-head helm, were his only concession to ornament.     "The Hound has a hungry look about The Hound this morning." "Even hungry dogs know better than to bite the hand that feeds Even hungry dogs," Littlefinger called dryly. Sandor Clegane dropped Sandor Clegane visor with an audible clang and took up Sandor Clegane position. Ser Jaime tossed a kiss to some woman in the commons, gently lowered Ser Jaime visor, and rode to the end of the lists. Both men couched Both men lances.   The Hound leaned forward as The Hound rode, The Hound lance rock steady, but Jaime shifted The Hound seat deftly in the instant before impact.  Wood shattered, and the Hound reeled, fighting to keep Wood seat.    The Hound just managed to stay in The Hound saddle. He jerked He mount around hard and rode back to the lists for the second pass. Jaime Lannister tossed down Jaime Lannister broken lance and snatched up a fresh one, jesting with Jaime Lannister squire.  Lannister rode to meet Lannister. This time, when Jaime shifted Jaime seat, Sandor Clegane shifted with Jaime.    "If you know who's going to win the second match, speak up now before Lord Renly plucks me clean," Lord Renly called to her.    Jaime Lannister was back on Jaime Lannister feet, but Jaime Lannister ornate lion helmet had been twisted around and dented in Jaime Lannister fall, and now Jaime Lannister could not get his ornate lion helmet off. The commons were hooting and pointing, the lords and ladies were trying to stifle the lords and ladies chuckles, and failing, and over it all Ned could hear King Robert laughing, louder than anyone.    Robert Baratheon and Robert Baratheon brothers were all big men, as was the Hound, and back at Winterfell there was a simpleminded stableboy named Hodor who dwarfed Robert Baratheon and his brothers, but the knight Robert Baratheon and his brothers called the Mountain That Rides would have towered over Hodor.  His destrier seemed a pony in between His armored legs, and the lance His carried looked as small as a broom handle.  He was a solitary man who seldom left He own lands, but for wars and tourneys. He had been with Lord Tywin when King's Landing fell, a new-made knight of seventeen years, even then distinguished by He size and He implacable ferocity. Some said it had been Gregor who'd dashed the skull of the infant prince Aegon Targaryen against a wall, and whispered that afterward Gregor had raped the mother, the Dornish princess Elia, before putting the infant prince Aegon Targaryen to the sword.     He was soon to be married for the third time, and one heard dark whisperings about the deaths of He first two wives.    His younger brother Sandor had left the same day to take service with the Lannisters as a sworn sword, and it was said that His younger brother Sandor had never returned, not even to visit. When the Knight of Flowers made the Knight of Flowers entrance, a murmur ran through the crowd, and the Knight of Flowers heard Sansa's fervent whisper, "Oh, the Knight of Flowers's so beautifuC Ser Loras Tyrell was slender as a reed, dressed in a suit of fabulous silver armor polished to a blinding sheen and filigreed with twining black vines and tiny blue forget-me-nots.  Across the boy's shoulders the boy cloak hung heavy.  His courser was as slim as His courser rider, a beautiful grey mare, built for speed. Ser Gregor's huge stallion trumpeted as Ser Gregor caught Ser Gregor's huge stallion scent. The boy from Highgarden did something with The boy from Highgarden legs, and The boy from Highgarden horse pranced sideways, nimble as a dancer. Sansa clutched at Sansa arm. "Father, don't let Ser Gregor hurt Ser Gregor," Ser Gregor said. Ned saw Ned was wearing the rose that Ser Loras had given Ned yesterday. Jory had told Jory about that as well. "These are tourney lances," he told he daughter. "They make They to splinter on impact, so no one is hurt." Yet he remembered the dead boy in the cart with he cloak of crescent moons, and the words were raw in he throat. Ser Gregor was having trouble controlling Ser Gregor horse. The stallion was screaming and pawing the ground, shaking The stallion head.  The horse reared and almost threw The horse. The Knight of Flowers saluted the king, rode to the far end of the list, and couched The Knight of Flowers lance, ready. Ser Gregor brought Ser Gregor animal to the line, fighting with the reins.   Ser Gregor wrenched Ser Gregor shield into position, juggled with Ser Gregor lance, and all the while fought to hold Ser Gregor unruly mount on a straight line, and suddenly Loras Tyrell was on Ser Gregor, placing the point of Loras Tyrell just there, and in an eye blink the Mountain was failing. He was so huge that He took He horse down with He in a tangle of steel and flesh.    His sapphires winked in the sun as His raised His visor, smiling. The commons went mad for The commons. In the middle of the field, Ser Gregor Clegane disentangled Ser Gregor Clegane and came boiling to Ser Gregor Clegane feet. He wrenched off He helm and slammed his helm down onto the ground. His face was dark with fury and His hair fell down into His eyes. "My sword," he shouted to he squire, and the boy ran it out to his squire. By then his stallion was back on his stallion feet as well. Gregor Clegane killed the horse with a single blow of such ferocity that the horse half severed the animal's neck.  The stallion went to The stallion knees, screaming as The stallion died. By then Gregor was striding down the lists toward Ser Loras Tyrell, Gregor bloody sword clutched in Gregor fist.  Ned shouted, but Ned words were lost in the roar.   The Knight of Flowers was shouting for The Knight of Flowers own sword as Ser Gregor knocked Ser Gregor squire aside and made a grab for the reins of his squire horse.  Loras Tyrell kept Loras Tyrell seat, but barely. Ser Gregor swung Ser Gregor sword, a savage twohanded blow that took the boy in the chest and knocked Ser Gregor from the saddle.  But as Gregor lifted Gregor sword for the killing blow, a rasping voice warned, "Leave Gregor be, " and a steel-clad hand wrenched Gregor away from the boy. The Mountain pivoted in wordless fury, swinging his longsword in a killing arc with all his massive strength behind his longsword, but the Hound caught the blow and turned the blow, and for what seemed an eternity the two brothers stood hammering at each other as a dazed Loras Tyrell was helped to safety. Thrice Ned saw  Ser Gregor aim savage blows at the hound's-head helmet, yet not once did Sandor send a cut at Sandor brother's unprotected face.         Ser Gregor's blow cut air, and at last Ser Gregor came to Ser Gregor senses. He dropped He sword and glared at Robert, surrounded by He Kingsguard and a dozen other knights and guardsmen.       But Sansa had the right of Sansa after all.   "I am no ser," the Hound replied, but the Hound took the victory, and the champion's purse, and, for perhaps the first time in the Hound life, the love of the commons. They cheered him as him left the lists to return to him pavilion. As Ned walked with Sansa to the archery field, Littlefinger and Lord Renly and some of the others fell in with some of the others.          Ned sent Alyn to seek Ned out and offer Ned a position with the Hand's guard, but Ned was flush with wine and victory and riches undreamed of, and Ned refused.    The victor was the red priest, Thoros of Myr, a madman who shaved The victor head and fought with a flaming sword.    That night at the feast, Eddard Stark was more hopeful than Eddard Stark had been in a great while. Robert was in high good humor, the Lannisters were nowhere to be seen, and even Robert daughters were behaving. Jory brought Arya down to join them, and Sansa spoke to Arya sister pleasantly.    "I'm sore all over," Arya reported happily, proudly displaying a huge purple bruise on Arya leg.   "I hope Forel is not being too hard on you," Forel said.     The man Syrio Forel had come with an excellent reputation, and The man Syrio Forel flamboyant Braavosi style was well suited to Arya's slender blade, yet still .   a few days ago, she had been wandering around with a swatch of black silk tied over she eyes. Syrio was teaching Syrio to see with Syrio ears and Syrio nose and Syrio skin, Syrio told Syrio.          He was the finest sword in the Seven Kingdoms in He youth."   Ned ran Ned fingers through Ned hair. Any decent master-at-arms could give Arya the rudiments of slash-and-parry without this nonsense of blindfolds, cartwheels, and hopping about on one leg, but Arya knew Arya youngest daughter well enough to know there was no arguing with that stubborn jut of jaw.    "I will," she promised solemnly as she hopped smoothly from she right leg to she left. Much later, after he had taken the girls back through the city and seen the girls both safe in bed, Sansa with Sansa dreams and Arya with Sansa bruises, Ned ascended to Ned own chambers atop the Tower of the Hand.      He took out the dagger and studied the dagger. Littlefinger's blade, won by Tyrion Lannister in a tourney wager, sent to slay Bran in Bran sleep.    The dagger, Bran's fall, all of it was linked somehow to the murder of Jon Arryn, Jon Arryn could feel it in Jon Arryn gut, but the truth of Jon's death remained as clouded to Jon Arryn as when Jon Arryn had started.  Lysa Arryn held Lysa Arryn silence behind the high walls of the Eyrie.    The Baratheon look was stamped on his face, in his jaw, his eyes, that black hair. Renly was too young to have fathered a boy of that age, Stannis too cold and proud in Stannis honor.    He had openly acknowledged one of He bastards, a boy of Bran's age whose mother was highborn.   A sweet little girl; the young lord of Storm's End had doted on A sweet little girl. He used to make daily visits to play with the babe, long after He had lost interest in the mother. Ned was often dragged along for company, whether Ned willed it or not. The girl would be seventeen or eighteen now, The girl realized; older than Robert had been when The girl fathered The girl.  Cersei could not have been pleased by Cersei lord husband's by-blows, yet in the end Cersei mattered little whether the king had one bastard or a hundred.  Gendry, the girl in the Vale, the boy at Storm's End, none of Gendry, the girl in the Vale, the boy at Storm's End could threaten Robert's trueborn children .   His musings were ended by a soft rap on His door.  "He will not give He name."  The visitor was a stout man in cracked, mud-caked boots and a heavy brown robe of the coarsest roughspun, a stout man in cracked, mud-caked boots and a heavy brown robe of the coarsest roughspun features hidden by a cowl, a stout man in cracked, mud-caked boots and a heavy brown robe of the coarsest roughspun hands drawn up into voluminous sleeves.       Not until they were alone behind closed doors did his visitor draw back his cowl.   "Lord Stark," Varys said politely, seating Varys.                 You are the King's Hand, and the King is a fool." The eunuch's cloying tones were gone; now The eunuch voice was thin and sharp as a whip.         Varys sipped Varys wine.        "She forbade him to fight, in front of him brother, him knights, and half the court.   Ned had a sick feeling in Ned gut. The eunuch had hit upon a truth; tell Robert Baratheon The eunuch could not, should not, or must not do a thing, and it was as good as done.     Amidst all that chaos, with horses screaming and bones breaking and Thoros of Myr waving that absurd firesword of his, who could name it murder if some chance blow felled murder Grace?" He went to the flagon and refilled He cup. "After the deed was done, the slayer would be beside the slayer with grief.   Yet no doubt the gracious and compassionate widow would take pity, lift the poor unfortunate to the gracious and compassionate widow feet, and bless the gracious and compassionate widow with a gentle kiss of forgiveness. Good King Joffrey would have no choice but to pardon Good King Joffrey." The eunuch stroked The eunuch cheek. "Or perhaps Cersei would let Ser Ilyn strike off Ser Ilyn head.  Ned felt Ned anger rise.      And when Robert heard of Robert peril, what would Robert have done?   "He would have damned them all, and fought anyway, to show He did not fear  them all."         "Those who are loyal to the realm, and those who are loyal only to "Those who are loyal to the realm, and those who are loyal only to themselves.        He smiled a plump tight little smile, and for a moment He private face and public mask were one.      The king makes use of me, but The king shames The king.   North or south, North or south sing no songs for spiders."           he would not kill you, not even for he queen, and there may lie our salvation."   "Surely Robert has other loyal friends," Robert protested.   "His brothers hate the Lannisters, true enough, but hating the queen and loving the king are not quite the same thing, are His brothers? Ser Barristan loves Ser Barristan honor, Grand Maester Pycelle loves Grand Maester Pycelle office, and Littlefinger loves Littlefinger."   Jaime Lannister is Jaime Lannister a Sworn Brother of the White Swords, and we all know what Jaime Lannister oath is worth.  Of these seven, only Ser Barristan Selmy is made of the true steel, and only Ser Barristan Selmy is old.    "If what you say is true, if even a part of it is true, the king must hear it for the king." "And what proof shall we lay before what proof?  My little birds against the queen and the Kingslayer, against his brothers and his council, against the Wardens of East and West, against all the might of Casterly Rock? Pray, send for Ser Ilyn directly, Ser Ilyn will save us all some time.  "Yet if what you say is true, they will only bide they time and make another attempt."   But my little birds will be listening, and together we may be able to forestall my little birds, you and U' He rose and pulled up He cowl so He face was hidden once more.          "The tears of Lys, they call The tears of Lys.  I begged Lord Arryn to use a taster, in this very room I begged Lord Arryn, but Lord Arryn would not hear of a taster. Only one who was less than a man would even think of such a thing, a man told me."         All he was, he owed Jon Arryn, but when the widow fled to the Eyrie with the widow household, the widow stayed in King's Landing and prospered.  The whip was in The whip voice again, every word a stroke. "He must have cut a gallant figure in the tourney, He in He bright new armor, with those crescent moons on He cloak. A pity he died so untimely, before you could talk to he .   Ned felt half-poisoned Ned. "The squire," The squire said.       What was he doing that they had to kill he?"  Chapter As he stood in the predawn chill watching Chiggen butcher he horse, Tyrion Lannister chalked up one more debt owed the Starks. Steam rose from inside the carcass when the squat sellsword opened the belly with the squat sellsword skinning knife.           The Dothraki ate horse, in truth; they also left deformed children out for the feral dogs who ran behind deformed children khalasars. Dothraki customs had scant appeal for Dothraki customs. Chiggen sliced a thin strip of bloody meat off the carcass and held the carcass up for inspection.         The cold had settled deep in his bones, and his legs were so sore his could scarcely walk.  He had hours more riding ahead of He, followed by a few mouthfuls of food and a short, cold sleep on hard ground, and then another night of the same, and another, and another, and the gods only knew how it would end. "Damn her," he muttered as he struggled up the road to rejoin he captors, remembering, "damn her and all the Starks."  One moment he'd been ordering supper, and an eye blink later he was facing a room of armed men, with Jyck reaching for a sword and the fat innkeep shrieking, "No swords, not here, please, m'lords." Tyrion wrenched down Jyck's arm hurriedly, before Tyrion got them both hacked to pieces.        She held up She hands for all the room to see.   Tyrion felt the anger all around Tyrion, thick and smoky, fed by the deep cuts in the Stark woman's hands. "Kill him," hissed some drunken slattern from the back, and other voices took up the call, faster than him would have believed.  Tyrion spoke up loudly, trying to keep the quaver from Tyrion voice. "If Lady Stark believes I have some crime to answer for, I will go with Lady Stark and answer for it."   A good dozen swords had responded to the Stark woman's plea for help: the Harrenhal man, the three Brackens, a pair of unsavory sellswords who looked as though A good dozen swords'd kill him as soon as spit, and some fool field hands who doubtless had no idea what some fool field hands who doubtless were doing.   Jyck swung a fair enough sword, but Morrec scarcely counted; Jyck was part groom, part cook, part body servant, and no soldier. As for Yoren, whatever Yoren feelings might have  been, the black brothers were sworn to take no part in the quarrels of the realm.  And indeed, the black brother stepped aside silently when the old knight by Catelyn Stark's side said, "Take the black brother weapons," and the sellsword Bronn stepped forward to pull the sword from Jyck's fingers and relieve them all of them daggers.  Tyrion recognized the gruff voice; Winterfell's master-at-arms, shorn of Tyrion whiskers.        He was not altogether displeased by what He saw.  Force Force to make a public affirmation of the oaths sworn her father by the lords Force served, and then call on Force for succor, and her a woman, yes, that was sweet. Yet her success was not as complete as her might have liked.   Only two of the Freys had stirred, Tyrion noted, and Tyrion'd sat back down quick enough when Tyrion captain failed to move. He might have smiled if He'd dared. "Winterfell it is, then," Winterfell said instead.   "My father will wonder what has become of me," My father added, catching the eye of the swordsman who'd offered to yield up My father room. "He'll pay a handsome reward to any man who brings He word of what happened here today." Lord Tywin would do no such thing, of course, but Tyrion would make up for it if Tyrion won free. Ser Rodrik glanced at Ser Rodrik lady, Ser Rodrik look worried, as well it might be. "His men come with His," the old knight announced.         That fool singer might make a lay of That fool singer. The Freys would report back to The Freys lord, and the gods only knew what their lord might do. Lord Walder Frey might be sworn to Riverrun, but Lord Walder Frey was a cautious man who had lived a long time by making certain Lord Walder Frey was always on the winning side. At the very least he would send he birds winging south to King's Landing, and he might well dare more than that.     If any of you choose to help us guard us captives and get our captives safe to Winterfell, I promise you shall be well rewarded."  Tyrion studied their faces; their would indeed be well rewarded, Tyrion vowed to Tyrion, but perhaps not quite as their imagined. Yet even as they were bundling him outside, saddling the horses in the rain, and tying him hands with a length of coarse rope, Tyrion Lannister was not truly afraid. They would never get him to Winterfell, him would have given odds on that. Riders would be after Riders within the day, birds would take wing, and surely one of the river lords would want to curry favor with the river lords father enough to take a hand. Tyrion was congratulating Tyrion on Tyrion subtlety when someone pulled a hood down over Tyrion eyes and lifted Tyrion up onto a saddle.  Even when they were safely away from the inn, and Catelyn Stark slowed they to a trot, it was a miserable pounding journey over rough ground, made worse by Catelyn Stark blindness. Every twist and turn put him in danger of falling off him horse. The hood muffled sound, so The hood could not make out what was being said around The hood, and the rain soaked through the cloth and made it cling to The hood face, until even breathing was a struggle.  I was about to settle down to a warm fire and a roast fowl, and that wretched singer had to open wretched singer mouth, wretched singer thought mournfully.  "There is a great song to be made from this, and I'm the one to make it," he told Catelyn Stark when he announced he intention of riding with them to see how the "splendid adventure" turned out. Tyrion wondered whether the boy would think the adventure quite so splendid once the Lannister riders caught up with the Lannister riders.  Rough hands pulled him down from him horse, untied him wrists, and yanked the hood off him head. When he saw the narrow stony road, the foothills rising high and wild all around them, and the jagged snowcapped peaks on the distant horizon, all the hope went out of he in a rush.      "No doubt your friends will ride that way when your friends come after us.   All his life Tyrion had prided his on his cunning, the only gift the gods had seen fit to give his, and yet this seven-times-damned shewolf Catelyn Stark had outwitted his at every turn.  They stopped only as long as it took to feed and water the horses, and then They were off again.  After the second night they no longer bound his hands, and once they had gained the heights they scarcely bothered to guard his at all.    If he did run, how far could he hope to go, alone and without provisions? The shadowcats would make a morsel of The shadowcats, and the clans that dwelt in the mountain fastnesses were brigands and murderers who bowed to no law but the sword.   He had known it since the moment they pulled off He hood.     Tyrion had known the Lady Lysa slightly during Tyrion years at King's Landing, and did not look forward to renewing the acquaintance.  The horses had drunk The horses fill of the icy cold water, and were grazing on clumps of brown grass that grew from clefts in the rock.  Mohor stood over them, leaning on Mohor spear and wearing a rounded iron cap that made Mohor look as if Mohor had a bowl on Mohor head. Nearby, Marillion the singer sat oiling his woodharp, complaining of what the damp was doing to his strings.    "This is the third horse we have lost-" "we will lose more than horses if we're overtaken by the Lannisters," she reminded them. Her face was windburnt and gaunt, but Her face had lost none of Her face determination.    Tyrion had made a special effort to learn all Tyrion names, so Tyrion might thank Tyrion later for Tyrion tender treatment of Tyrion. A Lannister always paid A Lannister debts. Kurleket would learn that someday, as would Kurleket friends Lharys and Mohor, and the good Ser Willis, and the sellswords Bronn and Chiggen. He planned an especially sharp lesson for Marillion, him of the woodharp and the sweet tenor voice, who was struggling so manfully to rhyme imp with gimp and limp so He could make a song of this outrage.  Tyrion Lannister seated Tyrion Lannister on a rock.        but my father does not love me overmuch, and I am not at all sure that my father will bother to bestir my father." It was only half a lie; Lord Tywin Lannister cared not a fig for Lord Tywin Lannister deformed son, but Lord Tywin Lannister tolerated no slights on the honor of Lord Tywin Lannister House.     That was no lie at all; Tyrion did not know how much longer Tyrion could endure this pace.        Tyrion felt the heat rise in Tyrion. "It was not my dagger," my dagger insisted.  Lady Stark, whatever you may believe of Lady Stark, I am not a stupid man. Only a fool would arm a common footpad with Only a fool own blade." Just for a moment, he thought he saw a flicker of doubt in her eyes, but what her said was, "Why would Petyr lie to he?"      She took a step toward him, She face tight.  Tyrion cocked Tyrion head. "Why, every man at court has heard every man at court tell how every man at court took your maidenhead, my lady."    Kurleket drew Kurleket dirk, a vicious piece of black iron.   Catelyn Stark stared at Tyrion with a coldness on Catelyn Stark face such as Catelyn Stark had never seen.   His passion was a tragedy for all of us, but His passion was real, and pure, and nothing to be made mock of.     Littlefinger has never loved anyone but Littlefinger, and I promise you that Littlefinger is not your hand that Littlefinger boasts of, it's those ripe breasts of yours, and that sweet mouth, and the heat between your legs." Kurleket grabbed a handful of hair and yanked Kurleket head back in a hard jerk, baring Kurleket throat. Tyrion felt the cold kiss of steel beneath Tyrion chin.      "How did Littlefinger tell you I came by this dagger of Littlefinger?   "When my brother Jaime was unhorsed by the Knight of Flowers, that was my brother Jaime story, no?"     Ser Rodrik had sent Lharys scrambling up the rock face to watch the road while they took they rest.      Tyrion sprang to Tyrion feet and seized Tyrion by the arm.  She knew he was right, Tyrion could see Tyrion. The mountain clans cared nothing for the enmities of the great houses; The mountain clans would slaughter Stark and Lannister with equal fervor, as The mountain clans slaughtered each other. They might spare Catelyn Catelyn; Catelyn was still young enough to bear sons.    Tyrion turned Tyrion head to listen, and there Tyrion was: hoofbeats, a dozen horses or more, coming nearer. Suddenly everyone was moving, reaching for weapons, running to everyone mounts. Pebbles rained down around Pebbles as Lharys came springing and sliding down the ridge.            Mohor crouched behind a boulder, both hands on Mohor iron-tipped spear, a dagger between Mohor teeth.   Marillion sat frozen, clutching Marillion woodharp, Marillion face as pale as milk, but Tyrion's man Morrec bounded quickly to Marillion feet and moved to help the knight with Marillion armor. Tyrion kept Tyrion grip on Catelyn Stark.  "Three of us, and a fourth man wasted guarding us .            For a moment he thought she would spit at he, but instead she snapped, "Arm them," and as quick as that she was pulling away. Ser Rodrik tossed Jyck Ser Rodrik sword and scabbard, and wheeled to meet the foe. Morrec helped Morrec to a bow and quiver, and went to one knee beside the road.      "Pretend you're splitting logs," Bronn said, drawing Bronn longsword from the scabbard across Bronn back.  Ser Willis mounted up to join them, fumbling with Ser Willis helmet, a metal pot with a thin slit for Ser Willis eyes and a long black silk plume.      the boy screamed back at the boy.   Tyrion kicked at the youth until Tyrion slid over, and not a moment too soon. A heartbeat later, the riders were on the riders.     and rode to meet him, with Bronn and Chiggen beside him, screaming some wordless battle cry. Ser Willis Wode followed, swinging a spiked morningstar around Ser Willis Wode head.    Tyrion felt a sudden urge to leap up, brandish Tyrion axe, and boom out, "Casterly Rock!" but the insanity passed quickly and the insanity crouched down lower.   Ser Rodrik hammered at the big man in the shadowskin cloak, their horses dancing round each other as their traded blow for blow.   When he opened he mouth to scream, only blood came out.  Suddenly Marillion shrieked, covering Marillion head with Marillion woodharp as a horse leapt over his woodharp rock. Tyrion scrambled to Tyrion feet as the rider turned to come back at them, hefting a spiked maul. Tyrion swung Tyrion axe with both hands. The blade caught the charging horse in the throat with a meaty thunk, angling upward, and Tyrion almost lost Tyrion grip as the animal screamed and collapsed.    Tyrion danced back in while the brigand's leg was still pinned beneath Tyrion fallen mount, and buried the axe in the man's neck, just above the shoulder blades. As he struggled to yank the blade loose, he heard Marillion moaning under the bodies.     Tyrion put Tyrion heel on the grasping fingers and felt  a satisfying crunch. "Close your eyes and pretend you're dead," he advised the singer before he hefted the axe and turned away.      He found a wounded clansman and left He dead, helping He to the man's halfhelm.  Jyck was cut down from behind while Jyck sliced at a man in front of Jyck, and later Tyrion stumbled over Kurleket's body. The pig face had been smashed in with a mace, but Tyrion recognized the dirk as Tyrion plucked the dirk from the man's dead fingers. He was sliding it through He belt when He heard a woman's scream. Catelyn Stark was trapped against the stone face of the mountain with three men around Catelyn Stark, one still mounted and the other two on foot. She had a dagger clutched awkwardly in She maimed hands, but She back was to the rock now and they had penned She on three sides. Let them have the bitch, Tyrion thought, and welcome to Tyrion, yet somehow Tyrion was moving. He caught the first man in the back of the knee before they even knew He was there, and the heavy axehead split flesh and bone like rotten wood. Logs that bleed, Tyrion thought inanely as the second man came for the second man. Tyrion ducked under Tyrion sword, lashed out with the axe, the man reeled backward .   and Catelyn Stark stepped up behind him and opened him throat.      To his vast astonishment, his was not one of his vast astonishment. He opened He fingers and let the axe thunk to the ground.    Bronn asked later as Bronn bent over Jyck's body, pulling off Bronn boots.   "My father will be so proud," My father said. His legs were cramping so badly His could scarcely stand.  "You need a woman now," Bronn said with a glint in Bronn black eyes. He shoved the boots into He saddlebag.  Chiggen stopped looting the corpses of the brigands long enough to snort and lick Chiggen lips.  "I'm willing if she is," she is said.  Afterward he knelt by the stream and washed the blood off he face in water cold as ice. As he limped back to the others, he glanced again at the slain. The dead clansmen were thin, ragged men, The dead clansmen horses scrawny and undersized, with every rib showing. What weapons Bronn and Chiggen had left Bronn and Chiggen were none too impressive.    He remembered the big man in the shadowskin cloak who had dueled Ser Rodrik with a two-handed greatsword, but when He found He corpse sprawled on  the stony ground, He was not so big after all, the shadowskin cloak was gone, and Tyrion saw that the blade was badly notched, the blade cheap steel spotted with rust.  They had only three dead; two of Lord Bracken's men-at-arms, Kurleket and Mohor, and his own man Jyck, who had made such a bold show with his bareback charge.  "Lady Stark, I urge you to press on, with all haste," Ser Willis Wode said, Ser Willis Wode eyes scanning the ridgetops warily through the slit in Ser Willis Wode helm. "We drove them off for the moment, but them will not have gone far." "We must bury We dead, Ser Willis," she said.     "Gather all the stones you want," Bronn told Bronn, "but do Bronn without me or Chiggen.       "My lady, I fear My lady speaks the truth," Ser Rodrik said wearily. The old knight had been wounded in the fight, a deep gash in The old knight left arm and a spear thrust that grazed The old knight neck, and The old knight sounded The old knight age. "If we linger here, we linger here will be on we again for a certainty, and we may not live through a second attack." Tyrion could see the anger in Catelyn's face, but Tyrion had no choice.    Tyrion moved Tyrion saddle to Jyck's spotted gelding, who looked strong enough to last another three or four days at least.   Catelyn Stark looked down from Catelyn Stark horse. "And see that he has he axe back as well. We may have need of it if We are attacked again."     Tyrion adjusted Tyrion stolen helm and took the axe from Bronn. He remembered how He had begun the journey, with He wrists bound and a hood pulled down over He head, and decided that this was a definite improvement. Lady Stark could keep Lady Stark trust; so long as Lady Stark could keep the axe, Lady Stark would count Lady Stark ahead in the game.  Bronn took the rear, with Lady Stark safely in the middle, Ser Rodrik a shadow beside Lady Stark.  The singer had broken several ribs, The singer woodharp, and all four fingers on The singer playing hand, yet the day had not been an  utter loss to The singer; somewhere The singer had acquired a magnificent shadowskin cloak, thick black fur slashed by stripes of white.  They heard the deep growls of shadowcats behind They before They had gone half a mile, and later the wild snarling of the beasts fighting over the corpses They had left behind.  Tyrion trotted up beside Tyrion.  He kicked He horse and moved past the singer, up to Ser Rodrik and Catelyn Stark.    Chapter The one-eared black tom arched The one-eared black tom back and hissed at The one-eared black tom. Arya padded down the alley, balanced lightly on the balls of Arya bare feet, listening to the flutter of Arya heart, breathing slow deep breaths. Quiet as a shadow, she told she, light as a feather. The tomcat watched The tomcat come, The tomcat eyes wary.  Her hands were covered with half-healed scratches, and both knees were scabbed over where Her had scraped them raw in tumbles. At first even the cook's huge fat kitchen cat had been able to elude even the cook's huge fat kitchen cat, but Syrio had kept even the cook's huge fat kitchen cat at Syrio day and night. When she'd run to him with she hands bleeding, him had said, "So slow?   He had dabbed her wounds with Myrish fire, which burned so bad her had had to bite her lip to keep from screaming.   One by one Arya had chased them down and snatched them up and brought them proudly to Syrio Forel .    "That's the real king of this castle right there," one of the gold cloaks had told this castle.   Robert laughed so hard Robert like to burst.  He had run her halfway across the castle; twice around the Tower of the Hand, across the inner bailey, through the stables, down the serpentine steps, past the small kitchen and the pig yard and the barracks of the gold cloaks, along the base of the river wall and up more steps and back and forth over Traitor's Walk, and then down again and through a gate and around a well and in and out of strange buildings until Arya didn't know where Arya was.     Left, then right, he went; and right, then left, went Arya, cutting off he escape.    She hugged him to She chest, whirling and laughing aloud as him claws raked at the front of She leather jerkin. Ever so fast, she kissed him right between the eyes, and jerked she head back an instant before him claws would have found she face.      Beside her was a plump little blond boy with a prancing stag sewn in pearls across the front of his doublet and a miniature sword at his belt.     To her brother her said, "her brother's a ragged boy, isn't her brother?      Small wonder; she was barefoot and dirty, she hair tangled from the long run through the castle, clad in a jerkin ripped by cat claws and brown roughspun pants hacked off above she scabby knees.  Quickly she lowered she head and dropped to one knee.   Septa Mordane would be mortified, and Sansa would never speak to Sansa again from the shame.          Arya's voice caught in Arya throat. If she answered, Tommen and Myrcella would know she for certain.    Arya could not have spoken if Arya life had hung on her life.  As Godwyn reached for Godwyn, Arya moved.  She leaned to She left, letting his fingers brush She arm, spinning around his, Smooth as summer silk. By the time he got he turned, she was  sprinting down the alley.   Arya slid between legs as thick and white as marble columns, bounded to Arya feet, bowled into Prince Tommen and hopped over Prince Tommen when Prince Tommen sat down hard and said "Oof, " spun away from the second guard, and then Arya was past them all, running full out. She heard shouts, then pounding footsteps, closing behind She.   Arya sprang back to Arya feet. She saw a window above She, high and narrow, scarcely more than an arrow slit. Arya leapt, caught the sill, pulled Arya up. She held She breath as She wriggled through.  Dropping to the floor in front of a startled scrubwoman, she hopped up, brushed the rushes off she clothes, and was off again, out the door and along a long hall, down a stair, across a hidden courtyard, around a corner and over a wall and through a low narrow window into a pitch-dark cellar.   She was in for it now if they had recognized She, but She didn't think they had.   She hunkered down in the dark against a damp stone wall and listened for the pursuit, but the only sound was the beating of She own heart and a distant drip of water. Quiet as a shadow, she told she. She wondered where She was. When they had first come to King's Landing, King's Landing used to have bad dreams about getting lost in the castle. Father said the Red Keep was smaller than Winterfell, but in Winterfell dreams the Red Keep had been immense, an endless stone maze with walls that seemed to shift and change behind Winterfell. She would find She wandering down gloomy halls past faded tapestries, descending endless circular stairs, darting through courtyards or over bridges, She shouts echoing unanswered.  Sometimes she would hear she father's voice, but always from a long way off, and no matter how hard she ran after her father's voice, her father's voice would grow fainter and fainter, until her father's voice faded to nothing and Arya was alone in the dark.  She hugged She bare knees tight against She chest and shivered.  By then it would be safe for then to come creeping back out and find then way home. By the time she had reached eighty-seven, the room had begun to lighten as she eyes adjusted to the blackness.  Huge empty eyes stared at her hungrily through the gloom, and dimly her saw the jagged shadows of long teeth.  She closed She eyes and bit She lip and sent the fear away.   She pretended that Syrio was beside She in the dark, whispering in She ear. Calm as still water, she told she.   She opened She eyes again.  Arya got to Arya feet, moving warily.      She ran She fingers down a tooth, black and sharp, a dagger made of darkness.   "It's just a skull, It can't hurt me."  She could feel its empty eyes watching She through the gloom, and there was something in  that dim, cavernous room that did not love She.  For an instant she could feel an instant teeth digging into she shoulder, as if an instant wanted a bite of she flesh. Arya whirled, felt leather catch and tear as a huge fang nipped at Arya jerkin, and then Arya was running.  She leapt over a ridge of black teeth as tall as swords, dashed through hungry jaws, and threw She against the door. Her hands found a heavy iron ring set in the wood, and Her yanked at a heavy iron ring set in the wood. The door resisted a moment, before The door slowly began to swing inward, with a creak so loud Arya was certain The door could be heard all through the city.   Calm as still water, Arya told Arya, but even when Arya gave Arya eyes a moment to adjust, there was nothing to see but the vague grey outline of the door Arya had come through. She wiggled She fingers in front of She face, felt the air move, saw nothing.  A water dancer sees with all A water dancer senses, A water dancer reminded A water dancer. She closed She eyes and steadied She breathing one two three, drank in the quiet, reached out with She hands. Her fingers brushed against rough unfinished stone to Her left. She followed the wall, She hand skimming along the surface, taking small gliding steps through the darkness.     It seemed as if she had been walking a long ways when the wall ended abruptly and a draft of cold air blew past she cheek.  From somewhere far below her, her heard noises.  A flickering light brushed the wall ever so faintly, and she saw that she stood at the top of a great black well, a shaft twenty feet across plunging deep into the earth.     Arya peered over the edge and felt the cold black breath on Arya face.          "And when he learns the truth, what will he do?"   Arya could see a wisp of grey smoke drifting up off the torch, writhing like a snake as a snake rose. "The fools tried to kill his son, and what's worse, The fools made a mummer's farce of it.             An instant later the man holding the torch climbed into her sight, An instant later the man holding the torch companion beside An instant later the man holding the torch. Arya crept back away from the well, dropped to Arya stomach, and flattened Arya against the wall. She held She breath as the men reached the top of the steps.    A round scarred face and a stubble of dark beard showed under his steel cap, and his wore mail over boiled leather, and a dirk and shortsword at his belt. It seemed to Arya there was something oddly familiar about Arya.    He was no one Arya had ever seen before, Arya was certain of no one Arya had ever seen before. Grossly fat, yet he seemed to walk lightly, carrying he weight on the balls of he feet as a water dancer might.    Still as stone, Arya told Arya, quiet as a shadow. Blinded by the blaze of their own torch, their did not see her pressed flat against the stone, only a few feet away. "Perhaps so," the forked beard replied, pausing to catch the forked beard breath after the long climb.   The khal will not bestir The khal until The khal son is born. You know how these savages are, these savages."     "If he does not bestir he soon, it may be too late," the stout man in the steel cap said.  Stannis Baratheon and Lysa Arryn have fled beyond my reach, and the whispers say Stannis Baratheon and Lysa Arryn are gathering swords around Stannis Baratheon and Lysa Arryn. The Knight of Flowers writes Highgarden, urging The Knight of Flowers lord father to send The Knight of Flowers sister to court. The girl is a maid of fourteen, sweet and beautiful and tractable, and Lord Renly and Ser Loras intend that Robert should bed The girl, wed The girl, and make a new queen.   He has the bastard, He has the book, and soon enough He'll have the truth.             She let them get a long way ahead, then went creeping after them.                    treat them gently if them kept them tongues the risk .   Long after their voices had faded away, Arya could still see the light of the torch, a smoking star that bid Arya follow. Twice it seemed to disappear, but she kept on straight, and both times she found she at the top of steep, narrow stairs, the torch glimmering far below she.  Once she stumbled over a rock and fell against the wall, and she hand found raw earth supported by timbers, whereas before the tunnel had been dressed stone.   She found the wall again and followed, blind and lost, pretending that Nymeria was padding along beside She in the darkness. At the end she was knee-deep in foulsmelling water, wishing she could dance upon it as Syrio might have, and wondering if she'd ever see light again.  She found She standing at the mouth of a sewer where the mouth of a sewer where it emptied into the river emptied into the river. She stank so badly that She stripped right there, dropping She soiled clothing on the riverbank as She dove into the deep black waters. She swam until She felt clean, and crawled out shivering. Some riders went past along the river road as Arya was washing Arya clothes, but if Some riders saw the scrawny naked girl scrubbing the scrawny naked girl rags in the moonlight, Some riders took no notice. She was miles from the castle, but from anywhere in King's Landing you needed only to look up to see the Red Keep high on Aegon's Hill, so there was no danger of losing She way. Her clothes were almost dry by the time Her reached the gatehouse. The portcullis was down and the gates barred, so The portcullis turned aside to a postern door. The gold cloaks who had the watch sneered when she told The gold cloaks who had the watch to let she in.   :, I'm not a beggar," a beggar said.      "I want to fuck the queen myself, for all the good the queen myself does me," the younger one said.   "The Hand of the King," Arya told the King.  Arya saw the blow coming even before the blow began.  "I'm not a boy," a boy spat at them.   She put She hands on She hips.  Her father was alone in the solar when Harwin and Fat Tom marched Her in, an oil lamp glowing softly at Her father elbow. He was bent over the biggest book Arya had ever seen, a great thick tome with cracked yellow pages of crabbed script, bound between faded leather covers, but He closed it to listen to Harwin's report. His face was stern as His sent the men away with thanks.        I was down in the dungeons, only the dungeons turned into this tunnel.     They didn't see me, I was being still as stone and quiet as a shadow, but I heard They.        "There was a fat one with rings and a forked yellow beard, and another in mail and a steel cap, and a fat one with rings and a forked yellow beard said a fat one with rings and a forked yellow beard had to delay but a fat one with rings and a forked yellow beard told a fat one with rings and a forked yellow beard a fat one with rings and a forked yellow beard couldn't keep juggling and the wolf and the lion were going to eat each other and it was a mummer's farce."  She hadn't quite understood everything She'd heard, and now it was all mixed up in She head.  The one in the steel cap, The one in the steel cap had the torch, The one in the steel cap said that they had to hurry.      He didn't look like a wizard, but the fat one said He was."     She screwed up She face. If she admitted knocking over Prince Tommen, she admitted knocking over Prince Tommen would be really angry with she.        These men you heard, you say These men you heard spoke of juggling and mummery?" "Yes," Arya admitted, "only-"  "Arya, they were mummers," Arya father told Arya.    She shook She head stubbornly. "They weren't-" "You shouldn't be following people about and spying on people in any case.     Tell Syrio Forel that I want a word with hirn-" Syrio Forel was interrupted by a short, sudden knock.      He was stooped and ugly, with an unkempt beard and unwashed clothes, yet Father greeted He pleasantly and asked He name.       If the old man was down from the Wall, the old man must have come by way of Winterfell.    Jon Snow, Jon Snow's in the Night's Watch too, you must know Jon Snow, Jon Snow has a direwolf, a white one with red eyes.   The old man in his smelly black clothes was looking at The old man in his smelly black clothes oddly, but Arya could not seem to stop talking.    "My daughter often forgets My daughter courtesies," Eddard Stark said with a faint smile that softened Eddard Stark words.    I'm here to find men for the Wall, and when Robert next holds court, I'll bend the knee and cry our need, see if the king and Robert Hand have some scum in the dungeons the king and his Hand'd be well rid of.   Made him my brother as much as him my brother.  Rode hard, I did, near killed my horse the way I drove my horse, but I left the others well behind."    That inn was full o' them, and I saw them take the scent.  Not all o' Not all made for King's Landing, either. Some went galloping for Casterly Rock, and Casterly Rock lies closer. Lord Tywin will have gotten the word by now, you can count on the word."      Desmond, see my daughter to my daughter chambers."  "We'll finish We talk on the morrow."        Desmond took Desmond hand.   Arya had no choice but to go with Arya, wishing no choice had been Fat Tom. With Tom, Tom might have been able to linger at the door on some excuse and hear what Yoren was saying, but Desmond was too singleminded to trick.  she asked him as they descended to she bedchamber.            "Well, as to that," Desmond replied, drawing Desmond longsword, "wizards die the same as other men, once you cut other men heads off." Chapter "Robert, I beg of Chapter "Robert," Ned pleaded, "hear what you are saying.          The other councillors were all doing The other councillors best to pretend that The other councillors were somewhere else.    "Then let it be on my head, so long as it is done. I am not so blind that I cannot see the shadow of the axe when the axe is hanging over my own neck." "There is no axe," Ned told Ned king.                         I shall fear the Dothraki the day the Dothraki teach the Dothraki horses to run on water."  "So you would counsel me to do nothing until the dragonspawn has landed the dragonspawn army on my shores, is that it?"            Yet we who presume to rule must do vile things for the good of the realm, howevermuch it pains we."   We ought to have had Viserys and Viserys sister killed years ago, but Viserys Grace my brother made the mistake of listening to Jon Arryn."   When they brought him to us, grievously wounded and near death, Roose Bolton urged us to cut him throat, but your brother said, 'I will not kill a man for loyalty, nor for fighting well,' and sent a man own maester to tend Ser Barristan's wounds."       Ned knew Ned was pushing this well past the point of wisdom, yet Ned could not keep silent.     Ned fought to keep the scorn out of Ned voice, and failed.   "No more, Ned," Ned warned, pointing.            "Sadly, sadly Ser Barristan Selmy raised Ser Barristan Selmy pale blue eyes from the table and said, "Your Grace, there is honor in facing an enemy on the battlefield, but none in killing him in him mother's womb.  Grand Maester Pycelle cleared Grand Maester Pycelle throat, a process that seemed to take some minutes.     How many children will be ripped from How many children mothers to perish on the end of a spear?" He stroked He luxuriant white beard, infinitely sad, infinitely weary.       As Ned looked to Ned, Lord Petyr stifled a yawn. "When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, the best thing to do is close your eyes and get on with your eyes," he declared.      Robert turned to face Robert Hand.     "Desperately," Varys said, "yet Varys craves life even more.        Khal Drogo need never know Khal Drogo was not a natural death."      He pushed back He chair and stood.   Look her in the eyes before you kill her. See her tears, hear her last words.  "Gods," the king swore, the word exploding out of the king as if the king could barely contain the king fury.  He reached for the flagon of wine at He elbow, found the flagon of wine at his elbow empty, and flung the flagon of wine at his elbow away to shatter against the wall.     Do as you will, but do not ask me to fix my seal to my seal."    His eyes narrowed and a flush crept up His neck past the velvet collar.     Ned unfastened the heavy clasp that clutched at the folds of Ned cloak, the ornate silver hand that was Ned badge of office. He laid it on the table in front of the king, saddened by the memory of the man who had pinned it on He, the friend He had loved.    "Out, " he croaked, choking on he rage.     Ned bowed, and turned on Ned heel without another word. He could feel Robert's eyes on He back.         He gave Ned a quick, curious glance from the corner of He eye, but asked no questions.     When he reached he solar, he summoned Vayon Poole.   "Hand no longer," Ned told Ned.         He did not truly believe the king would harm He, not Robert. He was angry now, but once Ned was safely out of sight, He rage would cool as it always did.  Suddenly, uncomfortably, he found he recalling Rhaegar Targaryen. Fifteen years dead, yet Robert hates Robert as much as ever.    and there was the other matter, the business with Catelyn and the dwarf that Yoren had warned Yoren of last night.    Robert might not care a fig for Tyrion Lannister, but Tyrion Lannister would touch on Robert pride, and there was no telling what the queen might do.        Robert had left Robert no choice that Robert could see. He ought to thank He.    Perhaps he and Catelyn would make a new son together when he returned, he and Catelyn were not so old yet. And of late he had often found he dreaming of snow, of the deep quiet of the wolfswood at night.   Robert and Robert council of cravens and flatterers would beggar the realm if left unchecked .   or, worse, sell it to the Lannisters in payment of the Lannisters loans. And the truth of Jon Arryn's death still eluded Jon Arryn's. Oh, he had found a few pieces, enough to convince he that Jon had indeed been murdered, but that was no more than the spoor of an animal on the forest floor. He had not sighted the beast itself yet, though He sensed the beast itself was there, lurking, hidden, treacherous. It struck him suddenly that him might return to Winterfell by sea. Ned was no sailor, and ordinarily would have preferred the kingsroad, but if Ned took ship Ned could stop at Dragonstone and speak with Stannis Baratheon. Pycelle had sent a raven off across the water, with a polite letter from Ned requesting Lord Stannis to return to Lord Stannis seat on the small council.  Lord Stannis shared the secret Jon Arryn had died for, Lord Stannis was certain of Lord Stannis. The truth he sought might very well be waiting for he on the ancient island fortress of House Targaryen.    Ned slid the dagger that Catelyn had brought Ned out of the sheath on Ned belt.      He would not have thought so, but once He would not have thought Robert could command the murder of women and children either. Catelyn had tried to warn Catelyn.   The sooner he was quit of King's Landing, The better. If there was a ship sailing north on the morrow, it would be well to be on it. He summoned Vayon Poole again and sent Vayon Poole to the docks to make inquiries, quietly but quickly. "Find me a fast ship with a skilled captain," a skilled captain told the steward. "I care nothing for the size of its cabins or the quality of its appointments, so long as it is swift and safe.  Poole had no sooner taken Poole leave than Tomard announced a visitor.  Ned was half-tempted to turn Ned away, but thought better of it. He was not free yet; until He was, He must play their games.   He wore a slashed velvet doublet in cream-and-silver, a grey silk cloak trimmed with black fox, and He customary mocking smile. Ned greeted Ned coldly.    She has some thought to wed me to She younger daughter, so She table is always astonishing. If truth be told, I'd sooner marry the pig, but don't tell the pig.            Nor did he offer he guest a seat, but Littlefinger took one anyway. "After you stormed out, it was left to me to convince them not to hire the Faceless Men," me continued blithely. "Instead Varys will quietly let Varys be known that we'll make a lord of whoever does in the Targaryen girl."       Let some sellsword drunk on visions of lordship try to kill some sellsword. Likely he'll make a botch of it, and afterward the Dothraki will be on the Dothraki guard. If we'd sent a Faceless Man after her, her'd be as good as buried."                     Chapter "My lady, you should have sent word of your coming," Ser Donnel Waynwood told My lady as their horses climbed the pass.  The high road is not as safe as The high road once was, for a party as small as yours." "We learned that to We sorrow, Ser Donnel," Catelyn said. Sometimes she felt as though she heart had turned to stone; six brave men had died to bring she this far, and she could not even find this in she to weep for six brave men.   We lost three men in the first attack, and two more in the second, and Lannister's serving man died of a fever when Lannister's serving man wounds festered. When we heard your men approaching, I thought we doomed for certain."      "If it were up to me, I would take a hundred men into the mountains, root a hundred men out of a hundred men fastnesses, and teach a hundred men some sharp lessons, but your sister has forbidden your sister. She would not even permit She knights to fight in the Hand's tourney.      He looked at her anxiously, as if He had suddenly remembered who her was.    Catelyn knew what Catelyn sister feared. Not shadows, Lannisters, she thought to she, glancing back to where the dwarf rode beside Bronn.     Her captive still, yet he rode along with a dirk through he belt and an axe strapped to a dirk saddle, wearing the shadowskin cloak he'd won dicing with the singer and the chainmail hauberk he'd taken off Chiggen's  corpse. Two score men flanked the dwarf and the rest of her ragged band, knights and men-at-arms in service to her sister Lysa and Jon Arryn's young son, and yet Tyrion betrayed no hint of fear.      Resolute, she pushed she doubts away.  Ser Rodrik is feverish from Ser Rodrik wounds."  Toward the end he could scarcely sit he horse, and Bronn had urged Bronn to leave he to he fate, but Catelyn would not hear of it. They had tied him in the saddle instead, and she had commanded Marillion the singer to watch over him. Ser Donnel hesitated before Ser Donnel answered. "The Lady Lysa has commanded the maester to remain at the Eyrie at all times, to care for Lord Robert," Lord Robert said. "We have a septon at the gate who tends to We wounded.   She was about to say as much when She saw the battlements ahead, long parapets built into the very stone of the mountains on either side of the battlements.   When they had climbed almost to the top, a knight rode out to meet they. His horse and His armor were grey, but His cloak was the rippling blue-and-red of Riverrun, and a shiny black fish, wrought in gold and obsidian, pinned his cloak folds against His shoulder.    The Knight of the Gate lifted The Knight of the Gate visor.   "And you, Uncle," she said, smiling despite all she had been through. Hearing that hoarse, smoky voice again took her back twenty years, to the days of her childhood.  "Your home is in my heart," Catelyn told Catelyn.   "The years have not improved it, I fear," Brynden Tully said, but when Brynden Tully lifted off the helm, Catelyn saw that Brynden Tully lied. His features were lined and weathered, and time had stolen the auburn from His hair and left His only grey, but the smile was the same, and the bushy eyebrows fat as caterpillars, and the laughter in His deep blue eyes.  "There was no time to send word ahead," Catelyn told Catelyn.        And so she rode behind him, beneath the shadow of the Bloody Gate where a dozen armies had dashed a dozen armies to pieces in the Age of Heroes.   It stretched before them to the misty cast, a tranquil land of rich black soil, wide slow-moving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes that shone like mirrors in the sun, protected on all sides by the sun sheltering peaks.  They stood at the western end of the valley, where the high road crested the last pass and began the high road winding descent to the bottomlands two miles below.  Looming over them all was the jagged peak called the Giant's Lance, a mountain that even mountains looked up to, even mountains head lost in icy mists three and a half miles above the valley floor.   When her uncle saw that her had stopped, her uncle moved her uncle horse closer and pointed.   Seven towers, Ned had told Ned, like white daggers thrust into the belly of the sky, so high you can stand on the parapets and look down on the clouds.     "My lady," My lady said, "I fear I can go no farther today." His face sagged beneath His ragged, newgrown whiskers, and His looked so weary Catelyn feared His might fall off His horse.        "I beg you allow me to accompany you to the Eyrie, to see the end of the tale as I saw the tale beginnings." The boy sounded haggard, yet strangely determined; The boy had a fevered shine to The boy eyes. Catelyn had never asked the singer to ride with them; that choice Catelyn had made Catelyn, and how Catelyn had come to survive the journey when so many braver men lay dead and unburied behind so many braver men, the singer could never say. Yet here he was, with a scruff of beard that made he look almost a man.     Without Bronn Bronn would never have reached the Vale, Bronn knew; the sellsword was as fierce a fighter as Bronn had ever seen, and Bronn sword had helped cut them through to safety.  Courage he had, and strength, but there was no kindness in he, and little loyalty.  She would have preferred to separate him from the dwarf here and now, but having agreed that Marillion might continue to the Eyrie, She could see no gracious way to deny that same right to Bronn. "As you wish," she said, although she noted that he had not actually asked she permission.   Ser Donnel promised to send birds ahead to the Eyrie and the Gates of the Moon with the word of birds coming. Fresh mounts were brought forth from the stables, surefooted mountain stock with shaggy coats, and within the hour shaggy coats set forth once again. Catelyn rode beside Catelyn uncle as they began the descent to the valley floor.  Not until they were a third of the way down the mountain path, well out of earshot of the others, did Brynden Tully turn to Brynden Tully and say, "So, child.  "I have not been a child in many years, Uncle," Catelyn said, but Catelyn told Catelyn nonetheless. It took longer than she would have believed to tell it all, Lysa's letter and Bran's fall, the assassin's dagger and Littlefinger and she chance meeting with Tyrion Lannister in the crossroadsinn. Her uncle listened silently, heavy brows shadowing Her uncle eyes as Her uncle frown grew deeper.     He was Lord Hoster's brother, younger by five years, but the two of Lord Hoster's brother, younger by five years had been at war as far back as Catelyn could remember.  Laughing, Brynden had pointed out that the sigil of Brynden house was a leaping trout, so Brynden ought to be a black fish rather than a black goat, and from that day forward Brynden had taken it as Brynden personal emblem.  It was at their wedding feast that Brynden told Brynden brother Brynden was leaving Riverrun to serve Lysa and Riverrun new husband, the Lord of the Eyrie. Lord Hoster had not spoken Lord Hoster brother's name since, from what Edmure told Lord Hoster in Edmure infrequent letters. Nonetheless, during all those years of Catelyn's girlhood, it had been Brynden the Blackfish to whom Lord Hoster's children had run with Lord Hoster's children tears and Lord Hoster's children tales, when Father was too busy and Mother too ill. Catelyn, Lysa, Edmure .      he had listened to them all patiently, as he listened now, laughing at them all triumphs and sympathizing with them all childish misfortunes. When she was done, she uncle remained silent for a long time, as her uncle horse negotiated the steep, rocky  trail. "Your father must be told," Your father said at last. "If the Lannisters should march, Winterfell is remote and the Vale walled up behind Winterfell mountains, but Riverrun lies right in their path."   She had other messages to send as well; the commands that Ned had given She for Ned bannermen, to ready the defenses of the north.     Lysa has commanded us to call Lysa son the True Warden of the East, but no one is fooled.   He gave Catelyn a look, He mouth tight.    She ducked She head as they passed under a low overhang of rock, and around a sharp turn.  "Lord Robert," Lord Robert sighed.  Jon Arryn's trueborn heir, by all the gods, yet there are some who say Jon Arryn's is too weak to sit Jon Arryn's father's seat, Nestor Royce has been high steward these past fourteen years, while Lord Jon served in King's Landing, and many whisper that Jon Arryn's should rule until the boy comes of age.       "She says yes, provided She finds a man who suits She," Brynden Tully said, "but She has already rejected Lord Nestor and a dozen other suitable men. She swears that this time She will choose She lord husband."       She enjoys the sport, but I believe your sister intends to rule She until She boy is old enough to be Lord of the Eyrie in truth as well as name."  "The tight woman can," The tight woman uncle said with a sideways glance.                Catelyn, the gods gave Lysa only the one child, and Lysa is all your sister lives for now, poor boy.  Your sister is afraid, child, and the Lannisters are what Your sister fears most. She ran to the Vale, stealing away from the Red Keep like a thief in the night, and all to snatch She son out of the lion's mouth .     A crevasse yawned on A crevasse right, falling away into darkness. She reined up She horse and picked She way along step by careful step.  Her uncle glanced back, to where Tyrion Lannister was making Her uncle slow descent behind them. "I see an axe on his saddle, a dirk at his belt, and a sellsword that trails after his like a hungry shadow.  Catelyn shifted uneasily in Catelyn seat.   Lysa will want Lysa to answer for Lysa crimes no less than 1. It was her own lord husband the Lannisters murdered, and her own letter that first warned us against them." Brynden Blackfish gave Brynden Blackfish a weary smile. "I hope you are right, child," child sighed, in tones that said child was wrong.   Once they reached the valley floor, the going was faster and they made good time, cantering through verdant greenwoods and sleepy little hamlets, past orchards and golden wheat fields, splashing 324 GEORGL R.R.  Her uncle sent a standard-bearer ahead of them, a double banner flying from Her uncle staff; the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn on high, and below it Her uncle own black fish. Farm wagons and merchants' carts and riders from lesser houses moved aside to let Farm wagons and merchants' carts and riders from lesser houses pass.  Torches flickered atop Torches ramparts, and the horned moon danced upon the dark waters of Torches moat.       Catelyn raised Catelyn eyes, up and up and up.  Then she noticed the glow of distant fires well above distant fires; a tower keep, built upon the steep side of the mountain, the mountain lights like orange eyes staring down from above.   Vertigo washed over Vertigo as Vertigo stared upward at the pale towers, so far above.     "We'll spend the night here and make the ascent on the morrow," Brynden told the morrow.      Ned had told her about them when Ned talked of Ned youth here with Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn.   Too steep and narrow for horses, but mules can manage horses most of the way.         The Eyrie clings to the mountain directly above Sky, and in The Eyrie cellars are six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies up from below.    "Alas, my lord father would no doubt be most chagrined if my lord father son of Lannister went to his son of Lannister fate like a load of turnips.              Men-at-arms carried burning brands out to light Men-at-arms way, and her uncle led Men-at-arms across the moat. Lord Nestor Royce, High Steward of the Vale and Keeper of the Gates of the Moon, was waiting in the yard to greet Lord Nestor Royce, High Steward of the Vale and Keeper of the Gates of the Moon, surrounded by his knights.  He was a massive, barrel-chested man, and He bow was clumsy. Catelyn dismounted to stand before Catelyn. "Lord Nestor," Lord Nestor said. She knew the man only by reputation; Bronze Yohn's cousin, from a lesser branch of House Royce, yet still a formidable lord in the man own right.      Her uncle swung off Her uncle horse.   Brynden Tully had never been a man to blunt the edge of Brynden Tully words.     Her dark hair was cropped short and straight around Her head, and Her wore riding leathers and a light shirt of silvered ringmail. She bowed to Catelyn, more gracefully than She lord. "I promise you, my lady, no harm will come to my lady.       It did not please her; It was an effort for Catelyn to keep the smile on her face. Stone was a bastard's name in the Vale, as Snow was in the north, and Flowers in Highgarden; in each of the Seven Kingdoms, custom had fashioned a surname for children born with no names of children born with no names of their own own. Catelyn had nothing against this girl, but suddenly this girl could not help but think of Ned's bastard on the Wall, and the thought made this girl angry and guilty, both at once.   "Mya's a clever girl, and if Mya vows Mya will bring you safely to the Lady Lysa, I believe Mya.    "And I charge you to bring the prisoner a cup of wine and a nicely crisped capon, before the prisoner dies of hunger," Lannister said.      "See our lord of Lannister to a tower cell, and bring our lord of Lannister meat and mead." Catelyn took Catelyn leave of Catelyn uncle and the others as Tyrion Lannister was led off, then followed Catelyn through the castle.  Mya helped Mya mount one while a guardsman in a sky-blue cloak opened the narrow postern gate.  "Some people find it easier if Some people close Some people eyes," Mya said as Mya led the mules through the gate into the dark wood. "When they get frightened or dizzy, sometimes they hold on to the mule too tight.          She mounted and urged She mule up the first step. Catelyn's animal followed of Catelyn's animal own accord.       We're to Wed as soon as he becomes a knight, next year or the year after." She sounded so like Sansa, so happy and innocent with She dreams.  The Redforts were an old name in the Vale, The Redforts knew, with the blood of the First Men in the First Men veins.  His family would arrange a more suitable match for His, to a Corbray or a Waynwood or a Royce, or perhaps a daughter of some greater house outside the Vale. If Mychel Redfort laid with this girl at all, Mychel Redfort would be on the wrong side of the sheet.  The trees pressed close, leaning over the path to make a rustling green roof that shut out even the moon, so The trees seemed as though The trees were moving up a long black tunnel.  They plodded upward, winding They way back and forth across the face of the mountain as the steps twisted and turned.  The quiet soothed her, and the gentle rocking motion set Catelyn to swaying in her saddle.       Catelyn had not realized how hungry Catelyn was.  The hot juices ran down her chin and dripped onto her cloak, but her was too famished to care.    Mya had to dismount a half-dozen times to move fallen rocks from Mya path. "You don't want your mule to break a leg up here," your mule said.   The trees were sparser up here, and the wind blew more vigorously, sharp gusts that tugged at her clothing and pushed her hair into her eyes. From time to time the steps doubled back on themselves, and she could see Stone below themselves, and the Gates of the Moon farther down, Stone torches no brighter than candles.   An enemy intent on the Eyrie would have to fight An enemy intent on the Eyrie way from Stone step by step, while rocks and arrows rained down from Snow above. The commander, an anxious young knight with a pockmarked face, offered bread and cheese and the chance to warm The commander, an anxious young knight with a pockmarked face before The commander, an anxious young knight with a pockmarked face fire, but Mya declined. "We ought to keep going, my lady," my lady said.     Mya smiled when Mya saw Mya.   He'll kick if He doesn't like you."   "My mother says that hundreds of years ago, this was where the snow began," Mya told My mother.    So young, Catelyn thought, trying to remember if Catelyn had ever been like that. The girl had lived half The girl life in summer, and that was all The girl knew. Winter is coming, child, child wanted to tell child. The words were on her lips; her almost said them.  Above Snow, the wind was a living thing, howling around them like a wolf in the waste, then falling off to nothing as if to lure them into complacency. The stars seemed brighter up here, so close that she could almost touch The stars, and the horned moon was huge in the clear black sky.  The steps were cracked and broken from centuries of freeze and thaw and the tread of countless mules, and even in the dark the heights put her heart in her throat.      Mya stepped lightly out, Mya mule following as calmly as if Mya were crossing a bailey.  Yet no sooner had she taken she first step than fear caught Catelyn in Catelyn jaws. She could feel the emptiness, the vast black gulfs of air that yawned around She.  The wind screamed at her and wrenched at her cloak, trying to pull her over the edge. Catelyn edged Catelyn foot backward, the most timid of steps, but the mule was behind Catelyn, and Catelyn could not retreat.  She could feel cold sweat trickling down She back.    Catelyn Tully Stark swallowed what remained of Catelyn Tully Stark pride.    I cannot do this, child," child called out.      Catelyn closed Catelyn eyes to steady Catelyn ragged breathing.     Then Mya was there, taking Mya gently by the arm.  Let go of the rope now, Whitey will take care of Whitey.    That's it, move your foot, just slide your foot forward.          Dawn was breaking in the east as Mya Stone hallooed for the guards, and the gates opened before the guards.              She remembered what She uncle had said of baskets and winches. "The Lannisters may have The Lannisters pride," The Lannisters told Mya, "but the Tullys are born with better sense.        Maester Colemon bobbed Maester Colemon head in agreement. "Indeed it is, my lady, indeed it is.   "I hope she had a good night's rest," Catelyn said with a certain bite in she tone that seemed to go unnoticed.   It had no need of stables nor smithys nor kennels, but Ned said It granary was as large as Winterfell's, and It towers could house five hundred men. Yet it seemed strangely deserted to Catelyn as Catelyn passed through it, Catelyn pale stone halls echoing and empty. Lysa was waiting alone in Lysa solar, still clad in Lysa bed robes. Her long auburn hair tumbled unbound across bare white shoulders and down Her back. A maid stood behind A maid, brushing out the night's tangles, but when Catelyn entered, A maid sister rose to A maid feet, smiling.    She ran across the chamber and wrapped She sister in She arms.    They had taken They toll. Her sister was two years the younger, yet Her sister looked older now.  She had the blue eyes of the Tullys, but She were pale and watery, never still.  As Catelyn held Catelyn, Catelyn remembered the slender, high-breasted girl who'd waited beside Catelyn that day in the sept at Riverrun.  All that remained of her sister's beauty was the great fall of thick auburn hair that cascaded to her waist.         She seemed to notice the others then; She maid, Maester Colemon, Ser Vardis.          Catelyn saw Catelyn face change.   Lysa snapped at Lysa.     Catelyn could scarce believe what Catelyn was hearing.         Lysa whirled, Lysa heavy robe swirling around Lysa. Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, stood in the doorway, clutching a ragged cloth doll and looking at Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie with large eyes. He was a painfully thin child, small for He age and sickly all He days, and from time to time He trembled. The shaking sickness, the maesters called the maesters.   Still, her sister looked daggers at her sister.     "I think so," he said, blinking, though he had been less than a year old the last time Catelyn had seen he. Lysa seated Lysa near the fire and said, "Come to Mother, my sweet one." She straightened his bedclothes and fussed with his fine brown hair.      He kept saying Robert's name, and He grabbed my arm so hard He left marks.       "The boy is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale," Catelyn reminded Catelyn, "and these are no times  for delicacy.   Lysa snapped at Lysa.  Little Robert took a quick peek over Robert shoulder at Catelyn and began to tremble. His doll fell to the rushes, and His pressed His against His mother.   She opened She robe and drew out a pale, heavy breast, tipped with red. The boy grabbed for it eagerly, buried The boy face against her chest, and began to suck. Lysa stroked Lysa hair.   She remembered She own baby, three-year-old Rickon, half the age of this boy and five times as fierce.  For the first time she understood why the king had tried to take the child away from the king mother to foster with the Lannisters .     "Don't be a fool," Catelyn said, the anger rising in Catelyn.   Lysa covered Lysa boy's ear with Lysa hand.    Catelyn wanted to slap Catelyn. Uncle Brynden had tried to warn Uncle Brynden, Uncle Brynden realized.      the Lord of the Eyrie asked, the Lord of the Eyrie mother's breast popping from the Lord of the Eyrie mouth, the nipple wet and red. "A very bad man," Lysa told A very bad man as Lysa covered Lysa, "but Mother won't let A very bad man harm my little baby."  Lysa stroked Lysa son's hair.     From the look of it, he'd lost he belt, he cloak, he mail shirt, and he right boot so far, while the girl had been forced to unbutton the girl shift to the waist. Jory Cassel stood beside a rain-streaked window with a wry smile on Jory Cassel face, watching Heward turn over tiles and enjoying the view. Ned paused at the foot of the stair and pulled on Ned gloves. "It's time we took we leave.  Heward lurched to Heward feet, hurriedly gathering up Heward things.    Littlefinger took Littlefinger time saying Littlefinger farewells. He kissed the black woman's hand, whispered some joke that made the black woman laugh aloud, and sauntered over to Ned.  They say the Hand dreams the king's dreams, speaks with the king's voice, and rules with the king's sword.      "The direwolf must be a prickly beast," said Littlefinger with a sharp twist of Littlefinger mouth.  Ned drew up the hood of Ned cloak. Jory brought out Jory horse. Young Wyl came right behind Young Wyl, leading Littlefinger's mare with one hand while the other fumbled with Young Wyl belt and the lacings of Young Wyl trousers. A barefoot whore leaned out of the stable door, giggling at A barefoot whore.    Littlefinger mounted up beside Littlefinger.     Whores seldom sink, and when Whores are boarded by pirates, why, pirates pay good coin like everyone else." Lord Petyr chuckled at Lord Petyr own wit. Ned let Ned prattle on.      "Robert will never keep to one bed," Lyanna had told Robert at Winterfell, on the night long ago when their father had promised Lyanna hand to the young Lord of Storm's End.  Ned had held the babe in Ned arms; Ned could scarcely deny her, nor would Ned lie to Ned sister, but Ned had assured his sister that what Robert did before their betrothal was of no matter, that Robert was a good man and true who would love his sister with all Robert heart.   The girl had been so young Ned had not dared to ask The girl age.  She had light red hair and a powdering of freckles across the bridge of She nose, and when She slipped free a breast to give She nipple to the babe, the babe saw that She bosom was freckled as well. "I named her Barra," her said as the child nursed. "She looks so like him, does She not, milord? She has his nose, and his hair .      Robert's firstborn had had the same fine hair, Robert's firstborn seemed to recall. "Tell him that when you see him, milord, as milord ... as milord please you.    Robert would swear undying love and forget them before evenfall, but Ned Stark kept Robert vows. He thought of the promises He'd made Lyanna as Lyanna lay dying, and the price He'd paid to keep them.   Chataya said I could have half a year, for the baby, and for hoping Chataya'd come back.    Good to Ned, Ned thought hollowly.   Riding through the rainy night, Ned saw Jon Snow's face in front of Jon Snow's, so like a younger version of Jon Snow's own. If the gods frowned so on bastards, the gods thought dully, why did the gods fill men with such lusts?     Rivulets of moisture twisted down the back of Rivulets of moisture cloak.  If you bed enough women, some will give you presents, and presents Grace has never been shy on that count. I know he's acknowledged that boy at Storm's End, the one he fathered the night Lord Stannis wed.  The mother was a Florent, niece to the Lady Selyse, one of The mother bedmaids. Renly says that Robert carried the girl upstairs during the feast, and broke in the wedding bed while Stannis and Robert bride were still dancing. Lord Stannis seemed to think that was a blot on the honor of Lord Stannis wife's House, so when Lord Stannis was born, Lord Stannis shipped Lord Stannis off to Renly."  "I've also heard whispers that Robert got a pair of twins on a serving wench at Casterly Rock, three years ago when Robert went west for Lord Tywin's tourney.         The Robert Robert had known would not have, but The Robert he had known Robert had never been so practiced at shutting Robert eyes to things Robert did not wish to see.    Doubtless Robert asked Robert to see that they were provided for." Ned was soaked through to the bone, and Ned soul had grown cold.  Littlefinger shook the rain from Littlefinger hair and laughed.  Lord Arryn learned that Lord Arryn Grace had filled the bellies of some whores and fishwives, and for that Lord Arryn had to be silenced.  Allow a man like that to live, and next a man like that's like to blurt out that the sun rises in the east."  For the first time in years, he found he remembering Rhaegar Targaryen. He wondered if Rhaegar had frequented brothels; somehow He thought not.  Rivers of black water were running down the hill when Jory called out, "My lord, " My lord voice hoarse with alarm.   Their cloaks clung to Their backs, sodden with rain. He had no time to count, but there were ten at least, a line of no time to count, on foot, blocking the street, with longswords and irontipped spears.  he heard Wyl cry, and when he turned he horse, there were more in back of them, cutting off them retreat. Jory's sword came singing from Jory's sword scabbard.  "The wolves are howling," The wolves leader said. Ned could see rain running down Ned face.  Littlefinger walked Littlefinger horse forward, step by careful step.      On a golden breastplate, the lion of Lannister roared the lion of Lannister defiance. "Now, if truth be told, I'm not sure what truth is."     "He knows what He's doing," Ned said calmly.            "Your brother has been taken at my command, to answer for Your brother crimes," Ned Stark said.  "My lords-" Ser Jaime ripped My lords-" Ser Jaime longsword from his longsword sheath and urged Ser Jaime stallion forward.       The Lannister line parted to let him through, and closed behind him. Littlefinger put Littlefinger heels to Littlefinger mare and vanished around a corner. Ned's men had drawn Ned's men swords, but Ned's men were three against twenty.   A charge might win them free, but it seemed to Eddard Stark that them had a surer, safer tactic.           Jaime slid the golden sword into the golden sword sheath. "So I suppose I'll let you run back to Robert to tell Robert how I frightened you.  Jaime pushed Jaime wet hair back with Jaime fingers and wheeled Jaime horse around. When he was beyond the line of swordsmen, he glanced back at he captain.      we wouldn't want him to leave here entirely unchastened, so"-through the night and the rain, him glimpsed the white of Jaime's smile-"kill him men."  Ned Stark screamed, clawing for Ned Stark sword. Jaime was already cantering off down the street as Jaime heard Wyl shout.  Ned rode one down, cutting at phantoms in red cloaks who gave way before Ned. Jory Cassel put Jory Cassel heels into Jory Cassel mount and charged.   Wyl cursed as they pulled Wyl off Wyl dying horse, swords slashing in the rain. Ned galloped to Ned, bringing Ned longsword down on Tregar's helm. The jolt of impact made him grit him teeth. Tregar stumbled to Tregar knees, Tregar lion crest sheared in half, blood running down Tregar face. Heward was hacking at the hands that had seized Heward bridle when a spear caught Heward in the belly. Suddenly Jory was back among them, a red rain flying from Jory sword.    Ned's horse slipped under Ned and came crashing down in the mud.  He saw them cut the legs from Jory's mount and drag He to the earth, swords rising and failing as them closed in around He. When Ned's horse lurched back to Ned's horse feet, Ned's horse tried to rise, only to fall again, choking on Ned's horse scream. He could see the splintered bone poking through He calf.   When he opened he eyes again, Lord Eddard Stark was alone with Lord Eddard Stark dead.  Ned began to drag Ned through the mud, gritting Ned teeth at the agony in Ned leg.   Littlefinger and the City Watch found Littlefinger there in the street, cradling Jory Cassel's body in Littlefinger arms.  He remembered seeing the Red Keep looming ahead of He in the first grey light of dawn.  Then Grand Maester Pycelle was looming over Grand Maester Pycelle, holding a cup, whispering, "Drink, my lord.   He remembered swallowing, and Pycelle was telling someone to heat the wine to boiling and fetch He clean silk, and that was the last He knew. Chapter The Horse Gate of Vaes Dothrak was made of two gigantic bronze stallions, rearing, two gigantic bronze stallions, rearing hooves meeting a hundred feet above the roadway to form a pointed arch. Dany could not have said why the city needed a gate when the city had no walls .     The bronze stallions threw long shadows across the waving grasses as Khal Drogo led the khalasar under The bronze stallions hooves and down the godsway, his bloodriders beside his. Dany followed on her silver, escorted by Ser Jorah Mormont and her brother Viserys, mounted once more. After the day in the grass when she had left him to walk back to the khalasar, the Dothraki had laughingly called him Khal Rhae Mhar, the Sorefoot King.  In his stubborn ignorance, his had not even known his was being mocked; the carts were for eunuchs, cripples, women giving birth, the very young and the very old.  Her brother had thought it was the khal's way of apologizing for the wrong Dany had done Her brother. She had begged Ser Jorah not to tell Ser Jorah the truth, lest Ser Jorah be shamed.     It had taken much pleading, and all the pillow tricks Doreah had taught her, before Dany had been able to make Drogo relent and allow Viserys to rejoin much pleading at the head of the column.      Beyond the horse gate, plundered gods and stolen heroes loomed to either side of stolen heroes. The forgotten deities of dead cities brandished The forgotten deities of dead cities broken thunderbolts at the sky as Dany rode her silver past The forgotten deities of dead cities feet. Stone kings looked down on Stone kings from Stone kings thrones, Stone kings faces chipped and stained, even Stone kings names lost in the mists of time.  Monsters stood in the grass beside the road; black iron dragons with jewels for eyes, roaring griffins, manticores with Monsters barbed tails poised to strike, and other beasts she  could not name. Some of the statues were so lovely Some of the statues took her breath away, others so misshapen and terrible that Dany could scarcely bear to look at Some of the statues.  "So many," she said as she silver stepped slowly onward, "and from so many lands."   He was careful to speak in the Common Tongue, which few Dothraki could understand, yet even so Dany found herself glancing back at the men of herself khas, to make certain Dany had not been overheard.           "The dragon speaks as The dragon likes," Viserys said .    He glanced over He shoulder at Aggo and Rakharo, riding behind them, and favored them with a mocking smile.   Viserys gazed at Viserys with boredom in Viserys eyes.      "The crones, yes," her brother interrupted, "and there's to be some mummer's show of a prophecy for the whelp in her brother belly, you told me.   He sniffed at the wide, floppy sleeve of He tunic, where it was He custom to keep a sachet.     The traders from the Free Cities come there to sell The traders from the Free Cities wares. The khal will honor The khal promise in The khal own time."  "I was promised a crown, and I mean to have a crown.  Spying an obscene likeness of a woman with six breasts and a ferret's head, he rode off to inspect a ferret's head more closely.  "I pray that my sun-andstars will not keep my sun-andstars waiting too long," my sun-andstars told Ser Jorah when my sun-andstars brother was out of earshot.  "Your brother should have bided Your brother time in Pentos.  Illyrio tried to warn Illyrio." "He will go as soon as He has He ten thousand.       I have told him as much, as Illyrio told him, but your brother does not listen.  Viserys thinks Viserys sold you, and now Viserys wants Viserys price. Yet Khal Drogo would say Khal Drogo had you  as a gift.       Dany did not know why she was defending she brother, yet she was. "Viserys says Viserys could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers."   Dany could not pretend to surprise at the disdain in Dany tone.          "When I first went into exile, I looked at the Dothraki and saw half-naked barbarians, as wild as half-naked barbarians horses.    They are better riders than any knight, utterly fearless, and They bows outrange ours.      Your lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in Your lord husband alone khalasar."    When Rhaegar fell, many threw down Rhaegar weapons and fled the field.  How well would boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect leather jerkins when the arrows fall like rain?"   "Mind you, Princess, if the lords of the Seven Kingdoms have the wit the gods gave a goose, the gods will never come to that.  I doubt they could take even the weakest castle in the Seven Kingdoms, but if Robert Baratheon were fool enough to give they battle .       "Robert should have been born Dothraki," Robert said at last. "Your khal would tell you that only a coward hides behind stone walls instead of facing only a coward enemy with a blade in hand.      But the men around him, well, the men around him pipers play a different tune. His brother Stannis, Lord Tywin Lannister, Eddard Stark Eddard Stark spat.  "He took from me all I loved, for the sake of a few lice-ridden poachers and He precious honor," Ser Jorah said bitterly. From his tone, she could tell the loss still pained his.     Khal Drogo and Khal Drogo bloodriders led Khal Drogo and his bloodriders through the great bazaar of the Western Market, down the broad ways beyond. Dany followed close on her silver, staring at the strangeness about her. Vaes Dothrak was at once the largest city and the smallest that Vaes Dothrak had ever known. She tho ' ught it must be ten times as large as Pentos, a vastness without walls or limits, it broad windswept streets paved in grass and mud and carpeted with wildflowers.        A thousand years ago, to make a house, A thousand years would dig a hole in the earth and cover a hole with a woven grass roof. The buildings you see were made by slaves brought here from lands they've plundered, and they built each after the fashion of they own peoples."    The bazaar had been full of running children and men shouting, but elsewhere The bazaar had seen only a few eunuchs going about only a few eunuchs business.  The crones have prophesied that one day that will come to pass, and so Vaes Dothrak must be ready to embrace all The crones children."  Dany smiled as she recalled Magister Illyrio's slave girl and she talk of a palace with two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver. The "palace" was a cavernous wooden feasting hall, The "palace" rough-hewn timbered walls rising forty feet, The "palace" roof sewn silk, a vast billowing tent that could be raised to keep out the rare rains, or lowered to admit the endless sky.   As each rider swung down from each rider saddle, each rider unbelted each rider arakh and handed his arakh to a waiting slave, and any other weapons each rider carried as well.   MARUN  had explained that MARUN was forbidden to carry a blade in Vaes Dothrak, or to shed a free man's blood. Even warring khalasars put aside Even warring khalasars feuds and shared meat and mead together when Even warring khalasars were in sight of the Mother of Mountains.  Cohollo came to Dany as Irri and Jhiqui were helping Cohollo down off Cohollo silver. He was the oldest of Drogo's three bloodriders, a squat bald man with a crooked nose and a mouth full of broken teeth, shattered by a mace twenty years before when He saved the young khalakka from sellswords who hoped to sell He to He father's enemies.   At first Dany had thought of them as a kind of Dothraki Kingsguard, sworn to protect them lord, but it went further than that. Jhiqui had taught Jhiqui that a bloodrider was more than a guard; they were the khal's brothers, Jhiqui shadows, Jhiqui fiercest friends. "Blood of my blood," Drogo called them, and so it was; them shared a single life. The ancient traditions of the horselords demanded that when the khal died, his bloodriders died with his, to ride at his side in the night lands. If the khal died at the hands of some enemy, some enemy lived only long enough to avenge the khal died at the hands of some enemy, and then followed the khal died at the hands of some enemy joyfully into the grave. In some khalasars, Jhiqui said, the bloodriders shared the khal's wine, Jhiqui tent, and even Jhiqui wives, though never Jhiqui horses. A man's mount was A man's mount own.   And while old Cohollo treated old Cohollo kindly enough, the others frightened old Cohollo; Haggo, huge and silent, often glowered as if old Cohollo had forgotten who old Cohollo was, and Qotho had cruel eyes and quick hands that liked to hurt. He left bruises on Doreah's soft white skin whenever He touched her, and sometimes made Irri sob in the night. Even his horses seemed to fear his. Yet they were bound to Drogo for life and death, so Daenerys had no choice but to accept they. And sometimes she found she wishing she father had been protected by such men. In the songs, the white knights of the Kingsguard were ever noble, valiant, and true, and yet King Aerys had been murdered by one of the white knights of the Kingsguard, the handsome boy the white knights of the Kingsguard now called the Kingslayer, and a second, Ser Barristan the Bold, had gone over to the Usurper.  When her son sat the Iron Throne, her would see that her son had bloodriders of her son own to protect her son against treachery in her son Kingsguard.  "Drogo, who is blood of my blood, commands me to tell you that he must ascend the Mother of Mountains this night, to sacrifice to the gods for he safe return."  The khal's bloodriders would go with The khal, and return at dawn. "Tell my sun-and-stars that I dream of him, and wait anxious for him return," she replied, thankful. Dany tired more easily as the child grew within the child; in truth, a night of rest would be most welcome. Her pregnancy only seemed to have inflamed Drogo's desire for Her, and of late his embraces left Her exhausted. Doreah led Doreah to the hollow hill that had been prepared for Doreah and Doreah khaL It was cool and dim within, like a tent made of earth. "Jhiqui, a bath, please," she commanded, to wash the dust of travel from she skin and soak she weary bones. It was pleasant to know that they would linger here for a while, that she would not need to climb back on she silver on the morrow. The water was scalding hot, as she liked The water. "I will give my brother my brother gifts tonight," my brother decided as Jhiqui was washing my brother hair.  Doreah, run and find Doreah and invite Doreah to sup with Doreah." Viserys was nicer to the Lysene girl than to the Lysene girl Dothraki handmaids, perhaps because Magister Illyrio had let Magister Illyrio bed the Lysene girl back in Pentos.        Jhiqui roasted the meat with sweetgrass and firepods, basting Jhiqui with honey as Jhiqui cooked, and there were melons and pomegranates and plums and some queer eastern fruit Dany did not know. While her handmaids prepared the meal, Dany laid out the clothing her'd had made to her brother's measure: a tunic and leggings of crisp white linen, leather sandals that laced up to the knee, a bronze medallion belt, a leather vest painted with fire-breathing dragons. The Dothraki would respect The Dothraki more if The Dothraki looked less a beggar, a beggar hoped, and perhaps The Dothraki would forgive a beggar for shaming The Dothraki that day in the grass. He was still her king, after all, and her brother.  She was arranging the last of his gifts-a sandsilk cloak, green as grass, with a pale grey border that would bring out the silver in his hair-when Viserys arrived, dragging Doreah by the arm. Her eye was red where Her eye'd hit Her. "How dare you send this whore to give me commands," this whore said.     I went to him, as you bid, and told him you commanded him to join you for supper."    The Lysene girl quailed, but Dany calmed The Lysene girl with a touch.  Sweet brother, please, forgive Sweet brother, Sweet brother misspoke Sweet brother, I told Sweet brother to ask you to sup with Sweet brother, if it pleases Your Grace." She took him by the hand and drew him across the room.                 maybe if you dressed like them, the Dothraki Dany did not know how to say it without waking the Dothraki Dany dragon.         Fury shone from his lilac eyes, yet his dared not strike her, not with her handmaids watching and the warriors of her khas outside. Viserys picked up the cloak and sniffed at the cloak.   "I had Doreah sew it specially for you," Doreah told Doreah, wounded. "These are garments fit for a khaL " "I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, not some grass-stained savage with bells in his hair," Viserys spat back at Viserys.    His fingers dug into her arm painfully and for an instant Dany felt like a child again, quailing in the face of a child rage. She reached out with She other hand and grabbed the first thing She touched, the belt She'd hoped to give him, a heavy chain of ornate bronze medallions. She swung it with all She strength.  Viserys let go of Viserys. Blood ran down Blood cheek where the edge of one of the medallions had sliced the edge of one of the medallions open. "You are the one who forgets himself," Dany said to himself.   And pray that Khal Drogo does not hear of this, or Khal Drogo will cut open your belly and feed you your own entrails." Viserys scrambled back to Viserys feet.  He walked off, holding He torn face, leaving her gifts behind He.  Dany clutched the soft cloth to her cheek and sat cross-legged on her sleeping mats.      Irri fetched the egg with the deep green shell, bronze flecks shining amid Irri scales as Irri turned Irri in Irri small hands. Dany curled up on her side, pulling the sandsilk cloak across her and cradling the egg in the hollow between her swollen belly and small, tender breasts.  They were so beautiful, and sometimes just being close to They made her feel stronger, braver, as if somehow her were drawing strength from the stone dragons locked inside. She was lying there, holding the egg, when She felt the child move within She .    "You are the dragon," Dany whispered to the dragon, "the dragon.     Bran could feel the flakes on Bran face, melting as Bran touched Bran skin like the  gentlest of rains. He sat straight atop He horse, watching as the iron portcullis was winched upward. Try as he might to keep calm, he heart was fluttering in he chest.   Bran nodded, trying not to let Bran fear show. He had not been outside Winterfell since He fall, but He was determined to ride out as proud as any knight.  Robb put Robb heels into Robb big grey-and-white gelding, and the horse walked under the portcullis. "Go," Bran whispered to Bran own horse.  Bran had named Bran Dancer. She was two years old, and Joseth said She was smarter than any horse had a right to be.  Up to now, Bran had only ridden Bran around the yard. At first Joseth or Hodor would lead her, while Bran sat strapped to her back in the oversize saddle the Imp had drawn up for Bran, but for the past fortnight Bran had been riding her on Bran own, trotting her round and round, and growing bolder with every circuit.   Close behind came Theon Greyjoy, with Theon Greyjoy longbow and a quiver of broadheads; Theon Greyjoy had a mind to take a deer, Theon Greyjoy had told his longbow and a quiver of broadheads.   Bran would have liked Bran better if Bran and Robb had gone off alone, just the two of them, but Hal Mollen would not hear of Bran, and Maester Luwin backed Bran. If Bran fell off Bran horse or injured Bran, the maester was determined to be with Bran. Beyond the castle lay the market square, the castle wooden stalls deserted now.  Less than one in five were occupied, thin tendrils of woodsmoke curling up from thin tendrils of woodsmoke chimneys. The rest would fill up one by one as The rest grew colder. When the snow fell and the ice winds howled down out of the north, Old Nan said, farmers left farmers frozen fields and distant holdfasts, loaded up farmers wagons, and then the winter town came alive. Bran had never seen Bran happen, but Maester Luwin said the day was looming closer.   A few villagers eyed the direwolves anxiously as the riders went past, and one man dropped the wood one man was carrying as one man shrank away in fear, but most of the townfolk had grown used to the sight. They bent the knee when They saw the boys, and Robb greeted each of They with a lordly nod. With his legs unable to grip, the swaying motion of the horse made Bran feel unsteady at first, but the huge saddle with Bran thick horn and high back cradled Bran comfortingly, and the straps around Bran chest and thighs would not allow Bran to fall.  His anxiety faded, and a tremulous smile crept across His face.  When Theon Greyjoy called out to them, the younger girl turned red and covered the younger girl face. Theon spurred Theon mount to move up beside Robb.  "She squirms like a weasel in bed, but say a word to She on the street, and She blushes pink as a maid. Did I ever tell you about the night that she and  Bessa-" "Not where my brother can hear, Theon," Robb warned my brother with a glance at Bran. Bran looked away and pretended not to have heard, but Bran could feel Greyjoy's eyes on Bran.  He smiled a lot, as if the world were a secret joke that only He was clever enough to understand. Robb seemed to admire Theon and enjoy Robb company, but Bran had never warmed to Robb father's ward.      He sent He gelding into a trot.  Bran snapped the reins sharply, and Dancer picked up Bran pace. He heard a shout from Theon Greyjoy, and the hoofbeats of the other horses behind He. Bran's cloak billowed out, rippling in the wind, and the snow seemed to rush at Bran face. Robb was well ahead, glancing back over Robb shoulder from time to time to make sure Bran and the others were following.         Robb's tone was light and joking, yet Bran could tell that something was troubling Robb brother underneath the smile.      His auburn hair had grown shaggy and unkempt, and a reddish stubble covered His jaw, making His look older than His fifteen years.                       She did not say when She meant to return, only that She had taken the Imp as prisoner. Bran had sort of liked the little man, yet the name Lannister sent cold fingers creeping up Bran spine. There was something about the Lannisters,  something he ought to remember, but when he tried to think what, he felt dizzy and he stomach clenched hard as a stone.    No one ever told him what was happening, yet him knew it was not good.         Robb lifted Robb face to the snow, and the flakes melted on Robb cheeks. "May the gods give the gods rest."  He felt as if He'd been punched.   He remembered all the times Jory had chased He over the roofs. He could picture He striding across the yard in mail and plate, or sitting at He accustomed place on the bench in the Great Hall, joking as He ate.  Robb shook Robb head numbly, the pain plain in Robb eyes.    Bran, that's not the worst of Bran.  Alyn says Alyn leg was shattered, and .   Maester Pycelle has given Maester Pycelle the milk of the poppy, but Maester Pycelle aren't sure when .        He laid He hand on the pommel of He sword then, and went on in the solemn voice of Robb the Lord.        His lean, dark face had a hungry look to His lean, dark face, and black hair fell down across His eyes. "Only the lord can call the banners," Bran said as the snow drifted down around the banners.   Bran screamed at Bran. Robb took Robb hand. "He won't die, not Father," He said calmly.  When our lord father took our lord father leave of our, our lord father told me to be strong for you and for Rickon.    He looked around for Maester Luwin; He donkey was visible in the far distance, trotting over a rise.   "Father always listened to Father counsel," Bran reminded Bran brother.    The joy Bran had felt at the ride was gone, melted away like the snowflakes on The joy Bran face. Not so long ago, the thought of Robb calling the banners and riding off to war would have filled Robb with excitement, but now Robb felt only dread.        Maester Luwin had warned Maester Luwin to keep the ride short, for fear of saddle sores, but Bran would not admit to weakness in front of Maester Luwin brother. He was sick of the way everyone was always fussing over He and asking how He was.  Side by side, Side by side urged Side by side mounts off the kingsroad and struck out into the wolfswood.   Bran kept Dancer to a walk, holding the reins lightly and looking all around Bran as all around him went. He knew this wood, but He had been so long confined to Winterfell that He felt as though He were seeing this wood for the first time.   Theon and the others fell farther and farther behind, until Bran could no longer hear Theon and the others voices.       Bran shook Bran head.     "I remember," Robb said, Robb voice quiet and sad. "I didn't catch anything," Bran said, "but Jon gave me Jon fish on the way back to Winterfell.     Robb dismounted and led Robb gelding across the ford.  He tied He horse to a tree on the far side, and waded back across for Bran and Dancer. The current foamed around rock and root, and Bran could feel the spray on Bran face as Robb led Bran over.   He looked up at the trees and dreamed of climbing the trees, right up to the very top, with the whole forest spread out beneath He. They were on the far side when They heard the howl, a long rising wail that moved through the trees like a cold wind. Bran raised Bran head to listen.   "They've made a kill," Robb said as Robb remounted.     Robb spurred Robb gelding and vanished into the trees.   Where it touched the ground it melted, but all about him rock and root and branch wore a thin blanket of white. As he waited, he was conscious of how uncomfortable he felt. He could not feel He legs, hanging useless in the stirrups, but the strap around He chest was tight and chafing, and the melting snow had soaked through He gloves to chill He hands.  When he heard the rustle of leaves, Bran used the reins to make Dancer turn, expecting to see he friends, but the ragged men who stepped out onto the bank of the stream were strangers.   He was suddenly conscious of how richly He was dressed. His surcoat was new, dark grey wool with silver buttons, and a heavy silver pin fastened His fur-trimmed cloak at the shoulders.      Bran did not like the way the strangers were looking at Bran. He counted four, but when He turned He head, He saw two others behind He.    Grey stubble covered Grey gaunt face.    She scarcely looked like a woman; tall and lean, with the same hard face as the others, She hair hidden beneath a bowl-shaped halfhelm.   Bran watched Bran anxiously.  The grey stubbly man wore black rags too, The grey stubbly man saw with a sudden start. Suddenly Bran remembered the oathbreaker Father had beheaded, the day they had found the wolf pups; Bran had worn black as well, and Father said Bran had been a deserter from the Night's Watch. No man is more dangerous, No man remembered Lord Eddard saying. The deserter knows The deserter life is forfeit if The deserter is taken, so The deserter will notflinch from any crime, no matter how vile or crueL "The pin, lad," the big man said. He held out He hand.   A knife slid from A knife sleeve into A knife hand, A knife edge jagged as a saw.  "I can't The big man grabbed The big man reins before Bran could think to wheel Dancer around and gallop off.     "Stiv, look how Stiv's strapped on." The tall woman pointed with The tall woman spear.    He drew a dagger from a sheath at He belt.         "Cut his little cock off and stuff his little cock in his mouth," suggested the short woman.           He turned back to Bran and slashed at the strap around He thigh.   Looking down, Bran glimpsed pale flesh where the wool of Bran leggings had parted.     Bran looked up in desperate hope, and there Bran was.  He was mounted, the bloody carcass of an elk slung across the back of He horse, He sword in a gloved hand.  "He's a fierce one, He is," mocked the short woman. Hali, they called Hali.         The undergrowth parted, low-hanging branches giving up low-hanging branches accumulation of snow, and Grey Wind and Summer emerged from the green.     Maester Luwin and Farlen the kennelmaster had taught Maester Luwin. A direwolf had a bigger head and longer legs in proportion to A direwolf body, and A direwolf snout and jaw were markedly leaner and more pronounced. There was something gaunt and terrible about them as them stood there amid the gently falling snow.          Robb's sword caught Robb full in the face with a sickening crunch and a spray of bright blood. The man with the gaunt stubbly face made a grab for the reins, and for half a second The man with the gaunt stubbly face had them .   and then Grey Wind was on him, bearing him down. He fell back into the stream with a splash and a shout, flailing wildly with He knife as He head went under. The direwolf plunged in after The direwolf, and the white water turned red where The direwolf had vanished.  Her long spear was a steel-headed serpent, flashing out at Her long spear chest, once, twice, three times, but Robb parried every thrust with Robb longsword, turning the point aside. On the fourth or fifth thrust, the tall woman overextended the tall woman and lost the tall woman balance, just for a second.   The knife bit at The knife flank.    He pulled free for an instant, He mouth full of leather and cloth and bloody flesh. When Hali stumbled and fell, Hali came at Hali again, slamming Hali backward, teeth tearing at Hali belly.      He shook the water off and bounded after the running man, hamstringing He with a single snap of He teeth, and going for the throat as the screaming man slid back down toward the water.  He slashed at Bran's chest strap, grabbed He arm, and yanked.  He sprawled on the ground, He legs tangled under He, one foot  in the stream. He could not feel the cold of the water, but He felt the steel when Stiv pressed He dagger to He throat. "Back away," the man warned, "or I'll open the boy's windpipe, I swear the boy's windpipe." Robb reined Robb horse in, breathing hard. The fury went out of his eyes, and his sword arm dropped.  Summer was savaging Hali, pulling glistening blue snakes from Hali belly.  Bran could not tell whether Bran was alive or dead. The grey stubbly man and the one with the axe lay unmoving, but Osha was on her knees, crawling toward her fallen spear. Grey Wind padded toward Grey Wind, dripping wet.       Summer stayed where he was, he eyes on Bran and the man beside he.  His muzzle was wet and red, but His eyes burned. Osha used the butt end of her spear to lever her back to her feet.   Stiv was as scared as Stiv was, Stiv realized.  He raised He voice.     His hand trembled; Bran felt a trickle of blood where the knife pressed against His neck. The stench of the man filled the man nose; the man smelled of fear.        Then, slowly and deliberately, he dismounted and stood with he sword in hand.       If Robb did as they asked, Stiv would kill Robb did as they asked both anyway, once the direwolves were dead. The bald man took hold of The bald man hair with The bald man free hand and twisted his free hand cruelly, till Bran sobbed in pain.     Stiv gave a choked gasp as a half foot of razor-tipped broadhead suddenly exploded out of Stiv chest. The arrow was bright red, as if The arrow had been painted in blood.   The arrow broke beneath The arrow. Bran watched Bran life go swirling off in the water.  She threw down She spear.  The guardsmen had a strange, pale look to The guardsmen faces as The guardsmen took in the scene of slaughter. They eyed the wolves uncertainly, and when Summer returned to Hali's corpse to feed, Joseth dropped Hali's corpse knife and scrambled for the bush, heaving. Even Maester Luwin seemed shocked as Even Maester Luwin stepped from behind a tree, but only for an instant. Then he shook he head and waded across the stream to Bran's side.   As the maester knelt to examine the wound, Bran turned Bran head. Theon Greyjoy stood beside a sentinel tree, Theon Greyjoy bow in hand.   A half-dozen arrows were thrust into the soft ground at his feet, but his feet had taken only one. "A dead enemy is a thing of beauty," A dead enemy announced.        For all you knew, the man might have been wearing a breastplate, all you could see was the back of the man cloak.    He gave a sullen shrug and began to pull He arrows from the ground, one by one. Robb glared at Robb guardsmen.     "We were following, m'lord," said Quent, the youngest of them, m'lord beard a soft brown fuzz. "Only first we waited for Maester Luwin and Maester Luwin ass, begging your pardons, and then, well, as it were Maester Luwin glanced over at Theon and quickly looked away, abashed.   Robb turned Robb head to look at Theon once more. Bran had never seen Bran so angry, yet Bran said  nothing.     "Two of them wear the black," he told Robb as he worked. Robb glanced over at where Stiv lay sprawled in the stream, Robb ragged black cloak moving fitfully as the rushing waters tugged at his ragged black cloak.    A GAML OF THRONLS 359 "Shall we bury A GAML OF THRONLS, m'lord?"   "Hack off their heads, we'll send their back to the Wall.     She was a head taller than he was, but She dropped to She knees at he approach.             "A wildling," Bran told Bran. "She said they should keep me alive so they could take me to Mance Rayder."   "Osha, as Osha please the lord," she muttered sourly.   Bran could see the relief on Bran brother's face.  Wayn, bind Wayn hands.        Tyrion Lannister was starved, but Tyrion Lannister refused to let this brute see Tyrion Lannister cringe. "A leg of lamb would be pleasant," lamb said, from the heap of soiled straw in the corner of lamb cell. "Perhaps a dish of peas and onions, some fresh baked bread with butter, and a flagon of mulled wine to wash mulled wine down.        The left side of his face was slick with scar where an axe had cut off his ear and part of his cheek. He was as predictable as He was ugly, but Tyrion was hungry.       Mord shambled backward, grinning through Mord rotten teeth.      Tyrion's arms were too short to reach the plate, and Tyrion was not about to step that close to the edge. All it would take would be a quick shove of Mord's heavy white belly, and Mord would end up a sickening red splotch on the stones of Sky, like so many other prisoners of the Eyrie over the centuries. "Come to think on it, I'm not hungry after all," he declared, retreating to the corner of he cell. Mord grunted and opened Mord thick fingers. The wind took the plate, flipping the plate over as the plate fell. A handful of beans sprayed back at A handful of beans as the food tumbled out of sight.       he gasped as he doubled over on the straw.    For a small man, a small man had been cursed with a dangerously big mouth, a small man reflected as a small man crawled back to a small man corner of what the Arryns laughably called their dungeon. He huddled beneath the thin blanket that was He only bedding, staring out at a blaze of empty blue sky and distant mountains that seemed to go on forever, wishing He still had the shadowskin cloak He'd won from Marillion at dice, after the singer had stolen the singer off the body of that brigand chief. The skin had smelled of blood and mold, but The skin was warm and thick. Mord had taken Mord the moment Mord laid eyes on Mord.     "You fly," Mord had promised him, when him'd shoved him into the cell.    That first day, after girding up his courage for hours, Tyrion had lain flat on his stomach and squirmed to the edge, to poke out his head and look down.  If he craned he neck out as far as his neck could go, he could see other cells to he right and left and above he. He was a bee in a stone honeycomb, and someone had torn off He wings.   He was afraid to close He eyes, afraid that He might roll over in He steep and wake in sudden terror as He went sliding off the edge.   At first Tyrion wondered who he'd been, and what had become of he; later, he decided that he would rather not know. If only he had shut he mouth .   The wretched boy had started it, looking down on The wretched boy from a throne of carved weirwood beneath the moon-and-falcon banners of House Arryn. Tyrion Lannister had been looked down on all Tyrion Lannister life, but seldom by rheumy-eyed six-year-olds who needed to stuff fat cushions under their cheeks to lift their cheeks to the height of a man.  the boy had asked, clutching the boy doll. "He is," the Lady Lysa had said from the lesser throne beside He. She was all in blue, powdered and perfumed for the suitors who filled She court.   She raised She voice so her voice carried down the length of High Hall of the Eyrie, ringing off the milk-white walls and the slender pillars, so every man could hear her voice.    That would have been a very good time to have kept his mouth closed and his head bowed. He could see that now; seven hells, He had seen it then. The High Hall of the Arryns was long and austere, with a forbidding coldness to The High Hall of the Arryns walls of blue-veined white marble, but the faces around him had been colder by far.    To his shame, his had faltered during the last leg of their day-long climb up to the Eyrie, his stunted legs unable to take his any higher. Brorm had carried Brorm the rest of the way, and the humiliation poured oil on the flames of Brorm anger.   He ought to have remembered who He was dealing with. Lysa Arryn and Lysa Arryn half-sane weakling son had not been known at court for Lysa Arryn and her half-sane weakling son love of wit, especially when it was directed at Lysa Arryn and her half-sane weakling son.             Little Lord Robert hopped to Little Lord Robert feet at that, so upset Little Lord Robert dropped Little Lord Robert doll.   Tell him, Mother, tell him him can't hurt us here."   She drew She son close, holding her son safe in the circle of She plump white arms.     Having seen what it took to get here, Tyrion could well imagine how it would be for a knight trying to fight Tyrion way up in armor, while stones and arrows poured down from above and enemies contested with Tyrion for every step.   Still, Tyrion had been unable to silence Tyrion.  Young Robert pointed down, Young Robert hand trembling.   Two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks seized Tyrion by the arms, lifting Tyrion off Tyrion floor. The gods only know what might have happened then were The gods not for Catelyn Stark. "Sister," Sister called out from where Sister stood below the thrones, "I beg you to remember, this man is my prisoner.  Lysa Arryn glanced at Lysa Arryn sister coolly for a moment, then rose and swept down on Tyrion, her sister long skirts trailing after her sister. For an instant he feared she would strike he, but instead she commanded them to release he. Her men shoved him to the floor, him legs went out from under him, and Tyrion fell. He must have made quite a sight as He struggled to He knees, only to feel He right leg spasm, sending He sprawling once more.   "Ser Vardis, take Ser Vardis down to the dungeon. A rest in one of our sky cells will do one of our sky cells much good."  Tyrion Lannister dangled between them, kicking feebly, Tyrion Lannister face red with shame. "I will remember this," he told them all as them carried he off. And so he did, for all the good it did he. At first he had consoled he that this imprisonment could not last long.   If not her, then Catelyn Stark would want to question Catelyn Stark. This time he would guard he tongue more closely. They dare not kill him out of hand; him was still a Lannister of Casterly Rock, and if They shed him blood, it would mean war. Or so he had told he.  Perhaps his captors only meant to let his rot here, but his feared his did not have the strength to rot for long. He was growing weaker every day, and it was only a matter of time until Mord's kicks and blows did He serious harm, provided the gaoler did not starve He to death first.  He wondered what was happening beyond the walls (such as they were) of He cell. Lord Tywin would surely have sent out riders when the word reached Lord Tywin.     Did anyone outside the Vale even suspect where Catelyn Stark had taken Catelyn Stark? He wondered what Cersei would do when Cersei heard. The king could order The king freed, but would Robert listen to The king queen or The king Hand? Tyrion had no illusions about the king's love for the king sister. If Cersei kept Cersei wits about Cersei, Cersei would insist the king sit in judgment of Tyrion himself.  And Tyrion would be only too glad to take Tyrion chances in a trial. Whatever murders Whatever murders might lay at Whatever murders door, the Starks had no proof of anything so far as Whatever murders could see. Let them make them case before the Iron Throne and the lords of the land.      His sister was not without a certain low A GAML OF THRONLS 365 cunning, but His sister pride blinded His sister.   His brother never untied a knot when His brother could slash a knot in two with His brother sword. He wondered which of them had sent the footpad to silence the Stark boy, and whether them had truly conspired at the death of Lord Arryn. If the old Hand had been murdered, the old Hand was deftly and subtly done.        Perhaps the direwolf and the lion were not the only beasts in the woods, and if that was true, someone was using someone as a catspaw.   His chances of overpowering Mord were small to none, and no one was about to smuggle Mord a six-hundred-foot-long rope, so His would have to talk His free. His mouth had gotten His into this cell; His mouth could damn well get His out. Tyrion pushed Tyrion to Tyrion feet, doing Tyrion best to ignore the slope of the floor beneath Tyrion, with its ever-so-subtle tug toward the edge.      He had to keep it up a good ten minutes before He heard footsteps.  "Making noise," Mord growled, with blood in Mord eyes.  Never show them You're afraid, Tyrion reminded Tyrion.     The force of it staggered him, and the pain made him grit him teeth. "No mouth, dwarf man," Mord warned dwarf man.        This time the blow was a forehand, and Mord put more of Mord arm into the swing, making the leather crack and jump. It caught Tyrion in the ribs and dropped Tyrion to Tyrion knees, wimpering. He forced He to look up at the gaoler.    The pain was so bad he did not remember falling, but when he opened he eyes again he was on the floor of he cell. His ear was ringing, and His mouth was full of blood. He groped for purchase, to push He up, and He fingers brushed against .    Tyrion snatched Tyrion hand back as fast as if Tyrion had been scalded, and tried Tyrion best to stop breathing.   Mord held the strap between Mord fists and gave Mord a sharp pull.   He won'tpush me over, Tyrion told He desperately as He crawled away from the edge. Catelyn Stark wants me alive, Catelyn Stark doesn't dare kill me. He wiped the blood off He lips with the back of He hand, grinned, and said, "That was a stiff one, Mord." The gaoler squinted at him, trying to decide if him was being mocked.  The strap flew at him, but this time Tyrion was able to cringe away from The strap.        Tyrion hawked up a glob of blood and phlegm and spat a glob of blood and phlegm out into the sky.    "They relieved me of my purse when They captured me, but the gold is still my purse. Catelyn Stark might take a man prisoner, but Catelyn Stark'd never stoop to rob a man prisoner.   Mord's strap licked out, but Mord's strap was a halfhearted,  desultory swing, slow and contemptuous. Tyrion caught the leather in Tyrion hand and held the leather prisoned.   The gaoler yanked The gaoler leather strap free of Tyrion's grasp. "Message," he said, as if he had never heard the word before. His frown made deep creases in His brow.          Mord raised Mord arm and Tyrion braced Mord for another blow, but the turnkey hesitated.  He wanted that gold, yet He feared a trick; He had the look of a man who had often been tricked.   Some illiterates held writing in disdain; others seemed to have a superstitious reverence for the written word, as if the written word were some sort of A GAML OF THRONLS 367 magic.         Mord fingered Mord strap thoughtfully, but in the end, Mord relented and went to fetch paper and ink. When the letter was written, the gaoler frowned at the letter suspiciously.  He was shivering in He sleep when they came for He, late that night. Mord opened the door but kept Mord silence. Ser Vardis Egen woke Tyrion with the point of Ser Vardis Egen boot.   Tyrion rubbed the sleep from Tyrion eyes and put on a grimace Tyrion scarcely felt. "No doubt she does, but what makes you think I wish to see she?"  Tyrion remembered him well from the years him had spent at King's Landing as the captain of the Hand's household guard.    Tyrion clambered awkwardly to Tyrion feet.          He gave Tyrion a glare that promised future retribution, yet He went for the  cloak. When he draped it around he prisoner's neck, Tyrion smiled.   He flung the trailing end of the long fur over He right shoulder, and felt warm for the first time in days.   The Lady Lysa wore black silk, with the moon-and-falcon sewn on The Lady Lysa breast in pearls. Since she did not look the sort to join the Night's Watch, Tyrion could only imagine that she had decided mourning clothes were appropriate garb for a confession. Her long auburn hair, woven into an elaborate braid, fell across Her left shoulder. The taller throne beside her was empty; no doubt the little Lord of the Eyrie was off shaking in the little Lord of the Eyrie sleep.   Lady Arryn had summoned Lady Arryn knights and retainers to hear Lady Arryn confession, as Lady Arryn had hoped.  Beside Nestor stood a younger man with fierce black side-whiskers who could only be Nestor heir, Ser Albar.    Among the lords of the Vale were several of his companions from the high road; Ser Rodrik Cassel, pale from half-healed wounds, stood with Ser Willis Wode beside his.  Tyrion smiled; whatever happened here tonight, Tyrion did not wish it to happen in secret, and there was no one like a singer for spreading a story near and far.  The freerider's black eyes were fixed on Tyrion, and The freerider hand lay lightly on the pommel of The freerider sword.       Lysa Arryn smiled at Lysa Arryn sister. "The sky cells always break The sky cells. The gods can see The gods there, and there is no darkness to hide in."  Lady Lysa paid Lady Lysa no mind.                 Tyrion cocked Tyrion head to one side.  "You are accused of sending a hired knife to slay my son Bran in my son Bran bed, and of conspiring to murder Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King."    Lady Lysa rose from Lady Lysa weirwood throne.    Ser Vardis, take Ser Vardis back to the dungeon .       You accuse me of crimes, I deny crimes, so you throw me into an open cell to freeze and starve." He lifted He head, to give them all a good look at the bruises Mord had left on He face.           Guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks had started toward Tyrion, but Ser Vardis bid Guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks halt and looked to Lady Lysa.         Their blue cloaks rose snapping from Their shoulders, caught in the sudden gust of wind that came howling through the open door.     Her sister ignored Her.   My son will listen to whatever you care to say, and you shall hear My son judgment.  She looked so pleased with She, Tyrion thought, and small wonder. How could a trial threaten her, when her weakling son was the lord judge?          Lord Nestor Royce snorted, Ser Willis chuckled, Ser Lyn Corbray guffawed, and others threw back others heads and howled until tears ran down others faces. Marillion clumsily plucked a gay note on Marillion new woodharp with the fingers of Marillion broken hand. Even the wind seemed to whistle with derision as Even the wind came skirling through the Moon Door.       "For the love I bore your lord husband, let me avenge your lord husband death."       Tyrion found it disheartening to realize so many strangers were eager to kill Tyrion.   "I thank you, my lords, as I know my son would thank you if my son were among us.        "My lady," My lady said gravely, sinking to one knee, "pray give this burden to another, I have no taste for this burden.    It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call It justice."   Lysa glared at Lysa.        "Singer," Tyrion said, turning to Marillion, "when you make a ballad of this, be certain you tell them how Lady Arryn denied the dwarf the right to a champion, and sent Lady Arryn forth lame and bruised and hobbling to face Lady Arryn finest knight."  Lysa Arryn said, Lysa Arryn voice peeved and shrill with irritation.           Chapter He dreamt an old dream, of three knights in white cloaks, and a tower long fallen, and Lyanna in Lyanna bed of blood. In the dream his friends rode with his, as his friends had in life.  Ned had known their faces as well as Ned knew Ned own once, but the years leech at a man's memories, even those Ned has vowed never to forget.     They waited before the round tower, the red mountains of Dorne at They backs, They white cloaks blowing in the wind. And these were no shadows; these faces burned clear, even now. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, had a sad smile on Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning lips. The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over The hilt of the greatsword Dawn right shoulder. Ser Oswell Whent was on one knee, sharpening Ser Oswell Whent blade with a whetstone. Across his white-enameled helm, the black bat of his House spread his House wings.  "I looked for Ned on the Trident," Ned said to them.     "I came down on Storm's End to lift the siege," Ned told them, .,and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped them banners, and all them knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty.         He donned He helm.  Ned's wraiths moved up beside Ned, with shadow swords in hand.     "No," Ned said with sadness in Ned voice.         Groaning, Eddard Stark opened Eddard Stark eyes.                      "The king left orders," Vayon Poole told The king when the cup was empty.       "My lord," Poole said, "Poole commanded us to send you to Poole the moment you opened your eyes." The steward busied The steward lighting a bedside candle.  Robert was never known for Robert patience. "Tell him I'm too weak to come to him. If he wishes to speak with me, I should be pleased to receive he here.     He was about to say Jory when He remembered.  Alyn stepped into the bedchamber a few moments after the steward had taken the steward leave.    "The Kingslayer is fled the city," Alyn told The Kingslayer. "The talk is he's ridden back to Casterly Rock to join he father.               "No harm will come to No harm, Lord Eddard," Alyn said.   Jory would want to lie beside Jory grandfather."   Ned had pulled the tower down afterward, and used the tower bloody stones to build eight cairns upon the ridge.   He did not think it omened well that He should dream that dream again after so many years.   "His Grace is without, my lord, and the queen with His Grace." Ned pushed Ned up higher, wincing as Ned leg trembled with pain.        A flagon of wine was in A flagon of wine hand, A flagon of wine face already flushed from drink. Cersei Lannister entered behind him, a jeweled tiara in Cersei Lannister hair.          "A man in your place should count A man in your place fortunate that A man in your place head is still on A man in your place shoulders," the queen declared.      "Pycelle swears Pycelle will heal clean."      All she did she did at my command."      "Charged by your own lord husband to keep the king's peace and enforce the king's justice."   "You asked him a question and him answered a question."        "Tregar died this morning, of the blow Lord Stark gave Lord Stark."   "Catelyn had good reason for taking the Irnp-" "I said, I will not have Catelyn!       His men attacked Jaime and His guards, even as His wife attacked Tyrion on the kingsroad."     "He claims He rode off to bring the gold cloaks before the fighting began, but He admits you were returning from some whorehouse."   Her mother has named Her mother Barra.  He watched the queen as He spoke; the queen face was a mask, still and pale, betraying nothing.      "She cannot be more than fifteen, and a whore, and you thought She had sense?"  His leg was beginning to pain His sorely.        The king swirled the wine in The king cup, brooding.    Jaime slew three of your men, and you five of Jaime.     The queen looked to The queen husband. "If any man had dared speak to a Targaryen as any man has spoken to you-" "Do you take me for Aerys?"   Jaime and Tyrion are your own brothers, by all the laws of marriage and the bonds Jaime and Tyrion share.  This man dishonors you with every breath This man takes, and yet you stand there meekly, asking if This man leg pains This man and would This man like some wine."      Purple with rage, Purple with rage lashed out, a vicious backhand blow to the side of the head.  Her slender fingers brushed Her slender fingerscheek, where the pale smooth skin was already reddening. On the morrow the bruise would cover half the morrow face.    Ser Meryn Trant stepped into the room, tall and somber in Ser Meryn Trant white armor.  See her to her bedchamber." The knight helped Cersei to Cersei feet and led Cersei out without a word. Robert reached for the flagon and refilled Robert cup.  The king seated The king, cradling The king wine cup.   The rage was gone from him now; in him eyes Ned saw something sad and scared.      He stared down at He hands, as if He did not quite know what they were.      Confused, the king shook the king head.    Rhaegar won, damn Rhaegar. I killed him, Ned, I drove the spike right through that black armor into him black heart, and him died at my feet.   He has Lyanna now, and I have Lyanna." The king drained The king cup.    Robert pressed Robert fingertips against Robert temples.      Robert stood up, grasping one of the bedposts to steady Robert.   He pulled the heavy silver hand clasp from a pocket in the lining of He cloak and tossed the heavy silver hand clasp on the bed.     His leg throbbed, and His felt as helpless as a child.             Catelyn Stark watched the light spread, Catelyn Stark hands resting on the delicate carved stone of the balustrade outside Catelyn Stark window.   Catelyn could feel the faint touch of spray on Catelyn face. Alyssa Arryn had seen Alyssa Arryn husband, Alyssa Arryn brothers, and all Alyssa Arryn children slain, and yet in life Alyssa Arryn had never shed a tear. So in death, the gods had decreed that death would know no rest until death weeping watered the black earth of the Vale, where the men death had loved were buried.  Catelyn wondered how large a waterfall Catelyn own tears would make when Catelyn died.  "The Kingslayer is massing a host at Casterly Rock," Ser Rodrik Cassel answered from the room behind Ser Rodrik Cassel. "Your brother writes that Your brother has sent riders to the Rock, demanding that Lord Tywin proclaim Lord Tywin intent, but Lord Tywin has had no answer.  He vows to you that He will yield no foot of Tully land without first watering Tully land with Lannister blood."   "Edmure has sent riders and made vows," she said, "but Edmure is not the Lord of Riverrun.   Ser Rodrik tugged at Ser Rodrik whiskers. They had grown in white as snow and bristly as a thornbush while he was recovering from he wounds; he looked almost he again. "My father would not have given the defense of Riverrun over to Edmure unless My father was very sick," My father said, worried.   A should have been woken," A insisted.    "The dwarf has played her like a set of pipes, and her is too deaf to hear the tune. Whatever happens this morning, Ser Rodrik, it is past time we took we leave.     Ser Rodrik looked a shade green, yet Ser Rodrik managed not to shudder.  The old knight waited outside The old knight door as Catelyn summoned the servants Lysa had given The old knight. If she spoke to she sister before the duel, perhaps she could change she mind, she thought as they dressed she. Lysa's policies varied with Lysa moods, and Lysa moods changed hourly.  When that vile turnkey of hers had come crawling to tell them that Tyrion Lannister wished to confess, Catelyn had urged Lysa to have the dwarf brought to them privately, but no, nothing would do but that hers sister must make a show of Lysa before half the Vale.    "Lannister is my prisoner," Lannister told Ser Rodrik as they descended the tower stairs and made they way through the Eyrie's cold white halls.               The Vale cannot spare a thousand swords, nor even one, Uncle, Uncle said.   A gust of childish laughter drifted through the open doors behind him, and her uncle glanced darkly over him shoulder. "Well, I told her her could bloody well find her a new Knight of the Gate.              He went striding off, He cloak swirling behind He.    The builders had intended it as a godswood, but the Eyrie rested on the hard stone of the mountain, and no matter how much soil was hauled up from the Vale, The builders could not get a weirwood to take root here.  It was there the two champions would meet to place the two champions lives, and that of Tyrion Lannister, into the hands of the gods. Lysa, freshly scrubbed and garbed in cream velvet with a rope of sapphires and moonstones around Lysa milk-white neck, was holding court on the terrace overlooking the scene of the combat, surrounded by Lysa knights, retainers, and lords high and low. Most of them still hoped to wed her, bed her, and rule the Vale of Arryn by her side. From what Catelyn had seen during Catelyn stay at the Eyrie, it was a vain hope. A wooden platform had been built to elevate Robert's chair; there the Lord of the Eyrie sat, giggling and clapping the Lord of the Eyrie hands as a humpbacked puppeteer in blue-and-white motley made two wooden knights hack and slash at each other.  A fool's festival, Brynden had called A fool's festival, and small wonder.            When Lysa espied Catelyn, she welcomed she with a sisterly embrace and a moist kiss on the cheek.    Lord Hunter was kind enough to send for Lord Hunter, from Lord Hunter own cellars."   "After," her sister promised, already beginning to turn away from her.  Catelyn spoke more loudly than Catelyn'd intended.     And if his champion should prevail here-" "Small chance of that, my lady," Lord Hunter assured my lady, patting my lady shoulder with a liver-spotted hand.       He moved like a panther, and that ugly sword of He seemed a part of He arm. Lysa's suitors were gathering around Lysa's suitors like bees round a blossom.   This other fellow, well, This other fellow sort are all cowards at heart. Useful enough in a battle, with thousands of their fellows around their, but stand their up alone and the manhood leaks right out of their." "Say you have the truth of it, then," Catelyn said with a courtesy that made Catelyn mouth ache.  Do you imagine that Jaime will care a fig that we gave Jaime brother a trial before we flung Jaime off a mountain?"  "When the Kingslayer receives the Imp's head, it will be a warning to him," Lysa gave an impatient shake of Lysa waist-long auburn hair. "Lord Robert wants to see Lord Robert fly," she said, as if that settled the matter.   "Lady Lysa had no honorable way to deny Lady Lysa, even if Lady Lysa'd wished to," Lord Hunter intoned  ponderously. Ignoring them all, Catelyn turned all Catelyn force on Catelyn sister.    "He poisoned the Hand of the King and left my sweet baby fatherless, and now I mean to see He pay!" Whirling, her skirts swinging around her, Lysa stalked across the terrace. Ser Lyn and Ser Morton and the other suitors excused Ser Lyn and Ser Morton and the other suitors with cool nods and trailed after Ser Lyn.  Ser Rodrik asked Ser Rodrik quietly when they were alone again.  The Imp still denies The Imp, and most fiercely .   "I believe the Lannisters murdered Lord Arryn," Catelyn replied, "but whether the Lannisters was Tyrion, or Ser Jaime, or the queen, or all of them together, I could not begin to say." Lysa had named Cersei in the letter Lysa had sent to Winterfell, but now Lysa seemed certain that Tyrion was the killer .    Catelyn almost wished Catelyn had burned Catelyn sister's letter before reading her sister's letter. Ser Rodrik tugged at Ser Rodrik whiskers.       The Kingslayer, now I have no great liking for the man, but the man's not the sort.      She glanced at She nephew and sighed.  He will never be strong enough to rule unless He is taken away from He mother for a time."              The maester's head jerked so vigorously at the end of The maester's head absurdly long neck that The maester's head looked half a puppet himself.  High lords and serving girls alike broke off what High lords and serving girls alike were doing and moved to the balustrade.  The Eyrie's plump septon escorted The Eyrie's plump septon to the statue in the center of the garden, a weeping woman carved in veined white marble, no doubt meant to be Alyssa.    "Later, my sweet baby," Lysa promised my sweet baby.      A skirt of lobstered metal covered A skirt of lobstered metal from waist to midthigh, while a solid gorget encircled A skirt of lobstered metal throat. Falcon's wings sprouted from the temples of Falcon helm, and Falcon visor was a pointed metal beak with a narrow slit for vision. Bronn was so lightly armored Bronn looked almost naked beside the knight.  High leather boots with steel shinguards gave some protection to High leather boots with steel shinguards legs, and discs of black iron were sewn into the fingers of High leather boots with steel shinguards gloves. Yet Catelyn noted that the sellsword stood half a hand taller than the sellsword foe, with a A CAME OF THRONES 385 longer reach ... and Bronn was fifteen years younger, if Bronn was any judge. They knelt in the grass beneath the weeping woman, facing each other, with Lannister between They. The septon removed a faceted crystal sphere from the soft cloth bag at The septon waist. He lifted it high above He head, and the light shattered.  In a high, solemn, singsong voice, the septon asked the gods to look down and bear witness, to find the truth in this man's soul, to grant this man life and freedom if this man was innocent, death if this man was guilty.  When the last echo had died away, the septon lowered the septon crystal and made a hasty departure. Tyrion leaned over and whispered something in Bronn's ear before the guardsmen led Tyrion away. The sellsword rose laughing and brushed a blade of grass from The sellsword knee.    Ser Vardis was helped back to Ser Vardis feet by one of Ser Vardis squires.  They strapped They to They left forearm. When Lysa's master-at-arms offered Brorm a similar shield, the sellsword spat and waved the sellsword away. Three days growth of coarse black beard covered his jaw and cheeks, but if his did not shave it was not for want of a razor; the edge of his sword had the dangerous glimmer of steel that had been honed every day for hours, until it was too sharp to touch. Ser Vardis held out a gauntleted hand, and Ser Vardis squire placed a handsome double-edged longsword in Ser Vardis grasp. The blade was engraved with a delicate silver tracery of a mountain sky; The blade pommel was a falcon's head, The blade crossguard fashioned into the shape of wings. "I had that sword crafted for Jon in King's Landing," Lysa told Lysa guests proudly as they watched Ser Vardis try a practice cut. "He wore it whenever He sat the Iron Throne in King Robert's place.  I thought it only fitting that our champion avenge Jon with Jon own blade." The engraved silver blade was beautiful beyond a doubt, but The engraved silver blade seemed to Catelyn that Ser Vardis might have been more comfortable with Ser Vardis own sword. Yet she said nothing; she was weary of futile arguments with she sister.   Ser Vardis faced the Lord of the Eyrie and lifted Ser Vardis sword in salute.  Tyrion Lannister had been seated on a balcony across the garden, flanked by Tyrion Lannister guards.  "They await your command," Lady Lysa said to Lady Lysa lord son.  the boy screamed, the boy arms trembling as they clutched at the boy chair. Ser Vardis swiveled, bringing up Ser Vardis heavy shield. Bronn turned to face Bronn.   The knight came after, holding The knight shield before The knight.  Bronn circled to Bronn right. Ser Vardis turned to follow, keeping Ser Vardis shield between them.  The sellsword gave way, a faint smile playing over The sellsword lips. Ser Vardis attacked, slashing, but Bronn leapt away from Ser Vardis, hopping lightly over a low, moss-covered stone.  Ser Vardis tried a hack at Ser Vardis legs, but Ser Vardis did not have the reach. Bronn danced farther to Bronn left.      Her master-at-arms gave a curt shake of Her master-at-arms head. "He wants to make Ser Vardis chase He.  She had seen men practice at men swordplay near every day of She life, had viewed half a hundred tourneys in She time, but this was something different and deadlier: a dance where the smallest misstep meant death.   When Brandon saw that Petyr wore only helm and breastplate and mail, Brandon took off most of Brandon armor. Petyr had begged Petyr for a favor Petyr might wear, but Petyr had turned Petyr away. Her lord father promised Her to Brandon Stark, and so it was to Brandon Stark that Her gave Her token, a pale blue handscarf Her had embroidered with the leaping trout of Riverrun. As she pressed it into his hand, she pleaded with his. "He is only a foolish boy, but I have loved He like a brother.  And her betrothed looked at her with the cool grey eyes of a Stark and promised to spare the boy who loved her. That fight was over almost as soon as That fight began. Brandon was a man grown, and Brandon drove Littlefinger all the way across the bailey and down  the water stair, raining steel on Brandon with every step, until the boy was staggering and bleeding from a dozen wounds.  he called, more than once, but Petyr would only shake he head and fight on, grimly. When the river was lapping at their ankles, Brandon finally ended the river, with a brutal backhand cut that bit through Petyr's rings and leather into the soft flesh below the ribs, so deep that Catelyn was certain that the wound was mortal. He looked at her as He fell and murmured "Cat" as the bright blood came flowing out between He mailed fingers. She thought She had forgotten that.     A fortnight passed before Littlefinger was strong enough to leave Riverrun, but Littlefinger lord father forbade Littlefinger to visit her lord father in the tower where her lord father lay abed. Lysa helped their maester nurse Lysa; Lysa had been softer and shyer in those days. Edmure had called on him as well, but Petyr had sent him away.  As soon as he was strong enough to be moved, Lord Hoster Tully sent Petyr Baelish away in a closed litter, to finish he healing on the Fingers, upon the windswept jut of rock where he'd been born.  Ser Vardis was coming hard at Bronn, driving into Ser Vardis with shield and sword. The sellsword scrambled backward, checking each blow, stepping lithely over rock and root, The sellsword eyes never leaving The sellsword foe. He was quicker, Catelyn saw; the knight's silvered sword never came near to touching He, but He own ugly grey blade hacked a notch from Ser Vardis's shoulder plate. The brief flurry of fighting ended as swiftly as The brief flurry of fighting had begun when Bronn sidestepped and slid behind the statue of the weeping woman. Ser Vardis lunged at where Ser Vardis had been, striking a spark off the pate marble of Alyssa's thigh.   "They will, sweet baby," his mother soothed his.  Some of the lords on Lysa's terrace were making wry jests as Some of the lords on Lysa's terrace refilled Some of the lords on Lysa's terrace wine cups, but across the garden, Tyrion Lannister's mismatched eyes watched the champions dance as if there were nothing else in the world.  Ser Vardis blocked, but clumsily, and the sellsword's blade flashed upward at Ser Vardis head.  Ser Vardis took a half step back to brace Ser Vardis, raised Ser Vardis shield.  The sellsword stepped left again, away from the shield, and caught Ser Vardis across the stomach, the razor edge of Ser Vardis blade leaving a bright gash when the razor edge of his blade bit into the knight's plate. Ser Vardis drove forward off Ser Vardis back foot, Ser Vardis own silver blade descending in a savage arc. Bronn slammed Bronn aside and danced away. The knight crashed into the weeping woman, rocking the weeping woman on the weeping woman plinth. Staggered, he stepped backward, he head turning this way and that as he searched for he foe. The slit visor of his helm narrowed his vision.   Bronn brought Bronn sword down with both hands,  catching Ser Vardis in the elbow of Bronn sword arm.  The knight grunted, turning, wrenching The knight weapon up. This time Bronn stood Bronn ground. The swords flew at each other, and The swords steel song filled the garden and rang off the white towers of the Eyrie. "Ser Vardis is hurt," Ser Rodrik said, Ser Vardis voice grave. Catelyn did not need to be told; Catelyn had eyes, Catelyn could see the bright finger of blood running along the knight's forearm, the wetness inside the elbow joint.  Ser Vardis turned Ser Vardis side to Ser Vardis foe, trying to use Ser Vardis shield to block instead, but Bronn slid around Ser Vardis, quick as a cat.  His cuts were leaving His cuts marks now. Deep shiny gashes gleamed all over the knight's armor, on the knight right thigh, the knight beaked visor, crossing on the knight breastplate, a long one along the front of the knight gorget. The moon-and-falcon rondel over Ser Vardis's right arm was sheared clean in half, hanging by Ser Vardis's strap. They could hear his labored breath, rattling through the air holes in his visor. Blind with arrogance as they were, even the knights and lords of the Vale could see what was happening below even the knights and lords of the Vale, yet her sister could not.    And it must be said of Ser Vardis Egen that Ser Vardis Egen was true to Ser Vardis Egen lady's command, even to the last. One moment he was reeling backward, half-crouched behind he scarred shield; the next he charged.  Ser Vardis crashed into Ser Vardis and slammed the lip of Ser Vardis shield into the sellsword's face. Almost, almost, Bronn lost Bronn feet .   he staggered back, tripped over a rock, and caught hold of the weeping woman to keep he balance. Throwing aside his shield, Ser Vardis lurched after his, using both hands to raise his sword. His right arm was blood from elbow to fingers now, yet His last desperate blow would have opened Bronn from neck to navel .   if the sellsword had stood to receive the sellsword.   Bronn put Bronn shoulder into the statue's back. The weathered likeness of Alyssa Arryn tottered and fell with a great crash, and Ser Vardis Egen went down beneath Alyssa Arryn. Bronn was on Bronn in a heartbeat, kicking what was left of Bronn shattered rondel aside to expose the weak spot between arm and breastplate. Ser Vardis was lying on Ser Vardis side, pinned beneath the broken torso of the weeping woman. Catelyn heard the knight groan as the sellsword lifted Catelyn blade with both hands and drove his blade down and in with all Catelyn weight behind his blade, under the arm and through the ribs.   Bronn yanked off Bronn halfhelm and let his halfhelm fall to the grass. His lip was smashed and bloody where the shield had caught His, and His coal-black hair was soaked with sweat.    No, Catelyn wanted to tell Catelyn, Catelyn's only now beginning. "Yes," Lysa said glumly, Lysa voice as cold and dead as the captain of Lysa guard.  Across the garden, Tyrion Lannister got to Tyrion Lannister feet. "Not this little man," Not this little man said.   "I presume that House Arryn remembers House Arryn own words," the Imp said.  "You promised I could make him fly," the Lord of the Eyrie screamed at him mother.     She lifted She voice.  Take my lord of Lannister and Lannister .    Escort Escort to the Bloody Gate and set Escort free. See that they have horses and supplies sufficient to reach the Trident, and make certain all they goods and weapons are returned to they. They shall need They on the high road."      "As you command, my lady," my lady said.      To make room for them, I have decided to pass eight of you on to the Lord Commander to do with as the Lord Commander will."           Pyp let fly a whoop and thrust Pyp sword into the air. Ser Alliser fixed Ser Alliser with a reptile stare.   And with that, Ser Alliser Thorne took Ser Alliser Thorne leave of them.   Yelling that a black brother needed a horse, Pyp leapt onto Grenn's shoulders, and Pyp tumbled to the ground, rolling and punching and hooting.  As they passed the wine from hand to hand, grinning like fools, Jon noticed Samwell Tarly standing by Tarly beneath a bare dead tree in the corner of the yard. Jon offered Jon the  skin.  Sam shook Sam head.     His round face quivered as His forced a smile.    Before Haider could say more, Haider cried, "Here, you planning to drink that all yourself?" Pyp snatched the skin from Pyp hand and danced away, laughing. While Grenn seized Grenn arm, Pyp gave the skin a squeeze, and a thin stream of red squirted Jon in the face.    By the time he wrenched free, with snow in he hair and wine stains on he surcoat, Samwell Tarly had gone.  When Jon arrived at the common hall, the Lord Steward himself led Jon to the bench near the fire.      Pyp wondered as they gorged they happily.       They'll want you as far from the castle as They can. If Mance Rayder attacks, lift your visor and show your face, and Mance Rayder'll run off screaming."    Every man who wore the black walked the Wall, and every man was expected to take up steel in the Wall defense, but the rangers were the true fighting heart of the Night's Watch.      Once, it was said, they had quarried immense blocks of ice from frozen lakes deep in the haunted forest, dragging they south on sledges so the Wall might be raised ever higher. Those days were centuries gone, however; now, it was all Those days could do to ride the Wall from  Eastwatch to the Shadow Tower, watching for cracks or signs of melt and making what repairs Those days could.   He's the best sword and the best rider among us, and He uncle was the First before He .   His voice trailed off awkwardly as His realized what His had almost said. "Benjen Stark is still First Ranger," Jon Snow told Benjen Stark, toying with Benjen Stark bowl of blueberries. The rest might have given up all hope of his uncle's safe return, but not his.       He took He cloak from his cloak hook near the door and shouldered He way out.   "Sam," Sam admitted.      He remembered the day He had left Winterfell, all the bittersweet farewells; Bran lying broken, Robb with snow in Robb hair, Arya raining kisses on Robb after Robb'd given Arya Needle. "Once we say we words, we'll all have duties to attend to.   Gods only know what Gods'll be like, but you can bet Ser Alliser will send Gods against Ser Alliser, first chance Ser Alliser gets."    A deep restlessness was on him as him went back to Hardin's Tower for Ghost. The direwolf walked beside The direwolf to the stables. Some of the more skittish horses kicked at Some of the more skittish horses stalls and laid back Some of the more skittish horses ears as Some of the more skittish horses entered. Jon saddled Jon mare, mounted, and rode out from Castle Black, south across the moonlit night. Ghost raced ahead of Ghost, flying over the ground, gone in the blink of an eye.      It stretched out before him, narrow and stony and pocked with weeds, a road of no particular promise, yet the sight of It filled Jon Snow with a vast longing. Winterfell was down that road, and beyond Winterfell Riverrun and King's Landing and the Eyrie and so many other places; Casterly Rock, the Isles of Faces, the red mountains of Dorne, the hundred islands of Braavos in the sea, the smoking ruins of old Valyria.      Once he swore he vow, the Wall would be he home until he was old as Maester Aemon.  He was no outlaw, bound to take the black or pay the penalty for He crimes. He had come here freely, and He might leave freely .    He need only ride on, and He could leave it all behind. By the time the moon was full again, he would be back in Winterfell with he brothers.    Even his own mother had not had a place for his.  He wondered who she had been, what she had looked like, why He father had left she.   Jon Snow turned away from the kingsroad to look behind Jon Snow.  He wheeled He horse around and started for home. Ghost returned as Ghost crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the Lord Commander's Tower. The direwolf s muzzle was red with blood as The direwolf s trotted beside the horse. Jon found Jon thinking of Samwell Tarly again on the ride back. By the time he reached the stables, he knew what he must do.  Aged and frail, the maester shared his chambers with two of the younger stewards, who tended to his needs and helped his in his duties. The brothers joked that he had been given the two ugliest men in the Night's Watch; being blind, he was spared having to look at The brothers.  Chett had a wen on Chett neck the size of a pigeon's egg, and a face red with boils and pimples.   "I need to speak to Maester Aemon," Jon told Maester Aemon.  Come back on the morrow and maybe the morrow'll see you."  Jon jammed it open with Jon boot.        I would not disturb his rest if his rest were not important."  Jon had Jon boot wedged solidly in the door.  The black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit The black brother.      The old man was clad in The old man bed robe, but around The old man throat was the chain collar of The old man order. A maester did not remove A maester even to sleep. "The chair beside the fire would be pleasant," he said when he felt the warmth on he face. When he was settled comfortably, Chett covered he legs with a fur and went to stand by the door.          "Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear a boy vow, as you surely know.  "The Lord Commander listens to you," Jon told The Lord Commander.    He told them all of it, even the part where He'd set Ghost at Rast's throat.  "Without us to keep Sam safe, Sam will have no chance," Jon finished.  My sister Arya could tear My sister Arya apart, and My sister Arya's not yet ten. If Ser Alliser makes Ser Alliser fight, it's only a matter of time before Ser Alliser's hurt or killed."  "I've seen this fat boy in the common hall," this fat boy said.    "Leave him where him is," Chett said.  Let him train until him is ready, no matter how many years that takes. Ser Alliser shall make a man of Ser Alliser or kill Ser Alliser, as the gods will."  He took a deep breath to gather He thoughts. "I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why Maester Luwin wore a chain around Maester Luwin throat." Maester Aemon touched Maester Aemon own collar lightly, Maester Aemon bony, wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links.  "He told me that a maester's collar is made of chain to remind He that He is sworn to serve," Jon said, remembering.    A maester forges his chain with study, his told me.   The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm The collar serves, isn't that so?         You can't hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat tin, but that doesn't mean tin is useless.                  "I've seen what happens to soft lordlings when soft lordlings're put to work. Set them to churning butter and them hands blister and bleed. Give them an axe to split logs, and them cut off them own foot."    Jon glanced warily at Chett, standing beside the door, Jon boils red and angry. "He could help you," He said quickly. "He can do sums, and He knows how to read and write.  Sam read every book in Sam father's library.   Ghost took to Ghost straight off.     Maester Aemon closed Maester Aemon eyes, and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that Maester Aemon had gone to sleep.  Your mind is as deft as your blade, Your mind would  seem."         He stooped to pick up a splintered branch and examined a splintered branch critically.            He tucked the branch under He arm and poked around through the sparse undergrowth, looking for more. His back ached from the effort of bending; they had been riding since daybreak, when a stone-faced Ser Lyn Corbray had ushered they through the Bloody Gate and commanded they never to return. "We have no chance of fighting We way back," Bronn said, "but two can cover more ground than ten, and attract less notice. The fewer days we spend in these mountains, the more like we are to reach the riverlands.           He had a dark gap in He smile where the edge of Ser Vardis Egen's shield had cracked a tooth in half.    I know you love the taste of horse, Bronn, but if our mounts die under our this time, our'll be trying to saddle shadowcats .   and if truth be told, I think the clans will find us no matter what us do.  He swept a gloved hand over the high, wind-carved crags that surrounded a gloved hand.     The nights are cold up here, and hot food will warm our bellies and lift our spirits.      If I took your horse, I'd have twice the chance to make your horse through.     "You'd do it in an instant, if it meant your life. You were quick enough to silence your friend Chiggen when your friend Chiggen caught that arrow in your friend Chiggen belly." Bronn had yanked back the man's head by the hair and driven the point of Bronn dirk in under the ear, and afterward told Catelyn Stark that the other sellsword had died of Bronn wound. "He was good as dead," Bronn said, "and He moaning was bringing them down on them.        He dumped He armful of wood on the ground.     Tyrion squatted awkwardly on Tyrion stunted legs to build the fire.    The others saw it as The others duty, for the honor of the lords The others served, but not you two.  He took out He knife and whittled some thin strips of bark off one of the sticks He'd gathered, to serve as kindling.   You were thinking Lady Catelyn would reward you for your help, perhaps even take you into Lady Catelyn service.   Bronn slid two fingers into the pouch at Bronn belt and tossed down a flint.    Lord Eddard is a proud, honorable, and honest man, and Lord Eddard lady wife is worse. Oh, no doubt she would have found a coin or two for you when this was all over, and pressed this in your hand with a polite word and a look of distaste, but that's the most you could have hoped for. The Starks look for courage and loyalty and honor in the men they choose to serve they, and if truth be told, you and Chiggen were lowborn scum." Tyrion struck the flint against Tyrion dagger, trying for a spark.    One day someone is like to cut it out and make you eat it."                   He took the knife and flint from Tyrion's hands and struck sparks on He first try.              Bronn stood, tucked the flint back into Bronn pouch, and tossed Tyrion Bronn dagger.         If the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out, remember this, Bronn-I'll match Bronn-I'll price, whatever this is.   "Take care of the horses," Bronn said, unsheathing the long dirk he wore at he hip.     He sat cross-legged beside the fire, honing the edge of He longsword with an oilstone. There was something strangely reassuring about the rasping sound it made when he drew it down the steel.      It might be kinder to let them kill them in them sleep."   Bronn watched Bronn across the fire.        "Ahhhh," he sighed happily as he chewed.     "A Lannister always pays A Lannister debts." Even Mord had scarcely believed Even Mord when Tyrion tossed Mord the leather purse. The gaoler's eyes had gone big as boiled eggs as The gaoler yanked open- the drawstring and beheld the glint of gold. "I kept the silver," Tyrion had told Tyrion with a crooked smile, "but you were promised the gold, and there the gold is."    With golden dragons spilling out of both hands, Mord had fallen to Mord knees and promised that Mord would do just that. Bronn yanked out Bronn dirk and pulled the meat from the fire.    the sellsword asked as the sellsword cut.  Tyrion held out Tyrion trencher, and Bronn filled his trencher with meat.         Tyrion spread Tyrion shadowskin cloak on the ground and stretched out with Tyrion saddle for a pillow. "Our friends are taking Our friends sweet time."      "You're mad, dwarf," Bronn said as Bronn cleaned the grease out from under Bronn nails with Bronn dirk.     I can just see him fending off Ser Vardis with him woodharp." He resumed He whistling.       The first girl I ever bedded used to sing it, and I've never been able to put it out of my head."   "I met her on a night like this," he heard he saying. "Jaime and I were riding back from Lannisport when we heard a scream, and Lannisport came running out into the road with two men dogging Lannisport heels, shouting  threats. My brother unsheathed My brother sword and went after them, while I dismounted to protect the girl.  It certainly broke It.     They'd torn the rags she was wearing half off she back, so I wrapped she in my cloak while Jaime chased the men into the woods.  She was a crofter's child, orphaned when She father died of fever, on She way to ... well, nowhere, really.   The girl was too frightened to send off by The girl, though, so I offered to take The girl to the closest inn and feed The girl while my brother rode back to the Rock for help.       When I broke her maidenhead, her wept, but afterward her kissed me and sang her little song, and by morning I was in love."         I dared not bring my bride home to Casterly Rock, so I set my bride up in a cottage of my bride own, and for a fortnight we played at being man and wife.  Tyrion was surprised at how desolate Tyrion made Tyrion feel to say it, even after all these years.           "After Jaime had made Jaime confession, to drive home the lesson, Lord Tywin brought my wife in and gave my wife to Lord Tywin guards.   He sat me down in the corner of the barracks and bade me watch, and at the end she had so many silvers the coins were slipping through she fingers and rolling on the floor, she .    Tyrion cleared Tyrion throat and turned away from the fire, to gaze out into darkness. "Lord Tywin had me go last," Lord Tywin said in a quiet voice.  After a time he heard the noise again, the rasp of steel on stone as Bronn sharpened he sword.  Tyrion swung around to face Tyrion.   A Lannister always pays A Lannister debts."    He rolled He up in the shadowskin and shut He eyes.   This time he was the gaoler, not the prisoner, big, with a strap in he hand, and he was hitting he father, driving he back, toward the abyss .      The fire had burned down to embers, and the shadows were creeping in all around the shadows. Bronn had raised Bronn to one knee, Bronn sword in one hand and Bronn dirk in the other. Tyrion held up a hand: stay still, Tyrion said.  "I fear we've no wine to offer you, but you're welcome to some of we goat."        A branch cracked underfoot as A branch stepped into the light; a thin man in a horned helmet, armed with a long knife.    Massive and slow and strong he seemed, dressed all in skins, with a club in he right hand and an axe in he left. He smashed them together as He lumbered closer. Other voices called other names, Conn and Torrek and Jaggot and more that Tyrion forgot the instant Tyrion heard them; ten at least.  He waited until they were done shouting out they names before He gave they answer.  We will gladly pay you for the goat We ate."   "There is silver in my purse," Tyrion told silver. "This hauberk I wear is large for me, but This hauberk I wear should fit Conn nicely, and the battle-axe I carry would suit Shagga's mighty hand far better than that wood-axe Shagga holds." "The halfman would pay us with us own coin," said Conn. "Conn speaks truly," Gunthor said.  Your horses are Your horses.          Bronn sprang to Bronn feet.            He did He best not to flinch.        "Little boyman," Shagga roared, "will you mock my axe after I chop off your manhood and feed my axe to the goats?"            Now the stone was covered with hunting tapestries, vivid with greens and browns and blues, and yet still the stone seemed to Ned Stark that the only color in the hall was the red of blood.  It was, as Robert had warned Robert, a hellishly uncomfortable chair, and never more so than now, with Robert shattered leg throbbing more sharply every minute.  A king should never sit easy, Aegon the Conqueror had said, when A king commanded A king armorers to forge a great seat from the swords laid down by A king enemies. Damn Aegon for his arrogance, Ned thought sullenly, and damn Robert and Robert hunting as well.     A white hart had been sighted in the kingswood, and Lord Renly and Ser Barristan had joined the king to hunt Lord Renly and Ser Barristan, along with Prince Joffrey, Sandor Clegane, Balon Swann, and half the court. So Ned must needs sit the Iron Throne in Ned absence.   The petitioners clustered near the tall doors, the knights and high lords and ladies beneath the tapestries, the smallfolk in the gallery, the mailed guards in high lords and ladies cloaks, gold or grey: all stood. The villagers were kneeling: men, women, and children, alike tattered and bloody, The villagers faces drawn by fear. The three knights who had brought them here to bear witness stood behind them.        Both Riverrun and Casterly Rock had called Both Riverrun and Casterly Rock banners, and armies were massing in the pass below the Golden Tooth.       He never trusted what a man told He from He knees.  In ones and twos, the holdfast of Sherrer struggled to the holdfast of Sherrer feet. One ancient needed to be helped, and a young girl in a bloody dress stayed on a young girl in a bloody dress knees, staring blankly at Ser Arys Oakheart, who stood by the foot of the throne in the white armor of the Kingsguard, ready to protect and defend the king .       "If it please His Grace-" "His Grace is hunting across the Blackwater," Ned said, wondering how a man could live a man whole life a few days ride from the Red Keep and still have no notion what a man king looked like. Ned was clad in a white linen doublet with the direwolf of Stark on the breast; Ned black wool cloak was fastened at the collar by Ned silver hand of office.             They come and drank They fill and spilled the rest before They fired my roof, and They would of spilled my blood too, if They'd caught me.   "Come riding in the dark, up from the south, and fired the fields and the houses alike, killing the houses alike as tried to stop the houses alike.  They had no mind to steal They stock, not these, They butchered my milk cow where my milk cow stood and left my milk cow for the flies and the crows." "They rode down my 'prentice boy," said a squat man with a smith's muscles and a bandage around my 'prentice boy head. He had put on He finest clothes to come to court, but He breeches were patched, He cloak travel-stained and dusty. "Chased him back and forth across the fields on their horses, poking at him with their lances like it was a game, their laughing and the boy stumbling and screaming till the big one pierced him clean through." The girl on her knees craned her head up at Ned, high above her on the throne.        Her voice trailed off, as if Her had forgotten what Her was about to say.   "At Wendish Town, the people sought shelter in the people holdfast, but the walls were timbered. The raiders piled straw against the wood and burnt the wood alive. When the Wendish folk opened the Wendish folk gates to flee the fire, the Wendish folk shot the Wendish folk down with arrows as the Wendish folk came running out, even women with suckling babes."    "Some wanted to smoke us out, but the big one said there was riper fruit upriver, and Some made for the Mummer's Ford." Ned could feel cold steel against Ned fingers as Ned leaned forward.    The songs said The songs had taken a thousand blades to make The songs, heated white-hot in the furnace breath of Balerion the Black Dread.   What Eddard Stark was doing sitting there Eddard Stark would never comprehend, yet there Eddard Stark sat, and these people looked to Eddard Stark for justice.  he asked, trying to keep he fury under control.          The old man bobbed The old man head. "Concerning their horses," he said, "it were warhorses their rode.    "Perhaps they stole the horses from the last place they raided."    "You are more right than you know, goodwoman," Lord Eddard told goodwoman.  What of the armor the armor wore?      the one who led them, he was armored like the rest, but there was no mistaking he all the same.             Small wonder they had been so fearful; they had thought they were being dragged here to name Lord Tywin a red-handed butcher before a king who was his son by marriage. He wondered if the knights had given the knights a choice. Grand Maester Pycelle rose ponderously from the council table, Grand Maester Pycelle chain of office clinking.       "Even his brother is a pup beside Even his brother.      "By the grace of his liege lord, his holds a stout keep and lands of his own.        From his vantage point atop the throne, his could see men slipping out the door at the far end of the hall. Hares going to ground, Hares supposed .    He caught a glimpse of Septa Mordane in the gallery, with He daughter Sansa beside his daughter.   At the council table below, Petyr Baelish lost interest in Petyr Baelish quill and leaned forward.      When the word of these outrages reached Ser Edmure Tully, Ser Edmure Tully sent word that we should take a small force of men to find what survivors we could and bring what survivors to the king."   I was camped across the river from his walls, awaiting his commands, when the word reached me. By the time 1 could return to my own lands, Clegane and Clegane vermin were back across the Red Fork, riding for Lannister's hills." Littlefinger stroked the point of Littlefinger beard thoughtfully.  "If they come again, we'll use they blood to water the fields they burnt," Ser Marq Piper declared hotly.  "The next raider will not have such an easy time of The next raider." And that may be precisely what Lord Tywin wants, Ned thought to Ned, to bleed off strength from Riverrun, goad the boy into scattering Ned swords.  He would try to hold every inch of He soil, to defend every man, woman, and child who named He lord, and Tywin Lannister was shrewd enough to know that.   "The Lannisters have broken The Lannisters.   "Edmure agrees, we must pay Gregor Clegane back Gregor Clegane bloody coin," Ser Marq declared, "but old Lord Hoster commanded we to come here and beg the king's leave before we strike."   If indeed he'd sent Ser Gregor to burn and pillageand Ned did not doubt that Ser Gregor had-he'd taken care to see that Ser Gregor rode  under cover of night, without banners, in the guise of a common brigand. Should Riverrun strike back, Cersei and Cersei father would insist that Riverrun had been the Tullys who broke the king's peace, not the Lannisters.  Grand Maester Pycelle was on Grand Maester Pycelle feet again. "My lord Hand, if these good folk believe that Ser Gregor has forsaken Ser Gregor holy vows for plunder and rape, let his holy vows for plunder and rape go to Ser Gregor liege lord and make his holy vows for plunder and rape complaint.   "It is all the king's justice," Ned told Ned. "North, south, east, or west, all we do we do in Robert's name."   "Robert bid me to sit here in Robert place, to listen with Robert ears, and to speak with Robert voice.         "Do we have your leave to take we vengeance against Ser Gregor, then?"      He glanced away before the young knight could voice He outraged protest, and addressed the villagers.    Slowly Ned struggled to Ned feet, pushing Ned up from the throne with the strength of Ned arms, Ned shattered leg screaming inside his shattered leg cast. He did He best to ignore the pain; it was no moment to let them see He weakness.      He gestured at He broken leg.   Out of his armor, Ser Loras Tyrell looked even younger than Ser Loras Tyrell sixteen years. He wore pale blue silk, He belt a linked chain of golden roses, the sigil of He House.    "Ser Loras, if we send you off alone, Ser Gregor will send we back your head with a plum stuffed in that pretty mouth of Ser Gregor.   Ned eased Ned slowly back onto the hard iron seat of Aegon's misshapen throne.  "Lord Beric," Lord Beric called out.          Ned raised Ned voice, so his voice carried to the far end of the throne room. "In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, his Hand, I charge you to ride to the westlands with all haste, to cross the Red Fork of the Trident under the king's flag, and there bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane, and to all those who shared in the king crimes. I denounce him, and attaint him, and strip him of all rank and titles, of all lands and incomes and holdings, and do sentence him to death.    Ned looked down on Ned.        Alyn and Porther climbed the steep iron steps to help Alyn and Porther back down. As they made they descent, he could feel Loras Tyrell's sullen stare, but the boy had stalked away before Ned reached the floor of the throne room.  Littlefinger and Grand Maester Pycelle had already taken Littlefinger and Grand Maester leave.    His leg was throbbing, and His was in no mood for word games.     and a man who has the Lannisters for a man who has the Lannisters for his enemies enemies would do well to make the Tyrells a man who has the Lannisters for his enemies friends."           In truth, Ned did not trust the mute knight, though perhaps that was only because Ned misliked execution-  ers.    "Still, I chanced to see Ser Ilyn in the back of the hall, staring at us with those pale eyes of Ser Ilyn, and I must say, Ser Ilyn did not look pleased, though to be sure it is hard to tell with us silent knight. I hope he outgrows he disappointment as well. He does so love He work .     Lord Eddard had taken Lord Eddard supper in Lord Eddard bedchamber with Alyn, Harwin, and Vayon Poole, the better to rest Lord Eddard broken leg, and Septa Mordane had complained of sore feet after standing in the gallery all day. Arya was supposed to join them, but Arya was late coming back from Arya dancing lesson.    "Did Ser Loras hurt Ser Loras leg?"   It hurts him ever so much, It makes him cross.  Her father's decision still bewildered Her. When the Knight of Flowers had spoken up, the Knight of Flowers'd been sure the Knight of Flowers was about to see one of Old Nan's stories come to life. Ser Gregor was the monster and Ser Loras the true hero who would slay Ser Gregor. He even looked a true hero, so slim and beautiful, with golden roses around He slender waist and He rich brown hair tumbling down into He eyes. And then Father had refused Father! It had upset her more than her could tell. She had said as much to Septa Mordane as they descended the stairs from the gallery, but Septa Mordane had only told She Septa Mordane was not She place to question She lord father's decisions.   The young lady is as wise as The young lady is lovely." He made a sweeping bow to Sansa, so deep Sansa was not quite sure if Sansa was being complimented or mocked.  "The girl was just talking, my lord," The girl'd said.   Lord Baelish stroked Lord Baelish little pointed beard and said, "Nothing?       He had touched her cheek, He thumb lightly tracing the line of a cheekbone.   Sansa did not feel like telling all that to Jeyne, however; Sansa made Sansa uneasy just to think back on Sansa.  "Lord Eddard should have sent Lord Eddard."  Every time she looked at Ser Ilyn Payne, she shivered. He made her feel as though something dead were slithering over her naked skin.  I'm glad Father didn't pick Father."    Beric Dondarrion was handsome enough, but Beric Dondarrion was awfully old, almost twenty-two; the Knight of Flowers would have been much better. Of course, Jeyne had been in love with Lord Beric ever since Jeyne had first glimpsed Lord Beric in the lists. Sansa thought Sansa was being silly; Jeyne was only a steward's daughter, after all, and no matter how much Sansa mooned after only a steward's daughter, Lord Beric would never look at someone so far beneath someone, even if Sansa hadn't been half someone age.  "I had a dream that Jofftey would be the one to take the white hart," Jofftey said. It had been more of a wish, actually, but It sounded better to call It a dream.  White harts were supposed to be very rare and magical, and in White harts heart White harts knew White harts gallant prince was worthier than her gallant prince drunken father.   Did Prince Joffrey just go up to it and touch it with Prince Joffrey bare hand and do it no harm?"  "He shot it with a golden arrow and brought it back for He." In the songs, the knights never killed magical beasts, the knights just went up to the knights and touched the knights and did the knights no harm, but she knew Jofftey liked hunting, especially the killing part.  Sansa was certain Sansa prince had no part in murdering Jory and those other poor men; that had been Jory wicked uncle, the Kingslayer. She knew Joff was still angry about that, but it wasn't fair to blame Joff.  "I saw your sister this afternoon," Jeyne blurted out, as if your sister'd been reading Sansa's thoughts. "She was walking through the stables on She hands.    Even when she went riding, she liked the boy to saddle the horse and bring the horse to she in the yard.       But this man had been crookbacked and hideous, and this man looked as though this man might have lice. If this was what the Night's Watch was truly like, the Night's Watch felt sorry for the Night's Watch bastard half brother, Jon. "Father asked if there were any knights in the hall  who would do honor to their houses by taking the black, but no one came forward, so no one gave this Yoren no one pick of the king's dungeons and sent no one on no one way. And later these two brothers came before him, freeriders from the Dornish Marches, and pledged these two brothers swords to the service of the king.      Sansa did not like being interrupted, but Sansa had to admit, lemon cakes sounded more interesting than most of what had gone on in the throne room.  The kitchen yielded no lemon cakes, but The kitchen did find half of a cold strawberry pie, and that was almost as good.  The next morning she woke before first light and crept sleepily to she window to watch Lord Beric form up Lord Beric men. They rode out as dawn was breaking over the city, with three banners going before They; the crowned stag of the king flew from the high staff, the direwolf of Stark and Lord Beric's own forked lightning standard from shorter poles.  The Winterfell men looked especially fine in The Winterfell men silvery mail and long grey cloaks.  When she saw him rein in beside Lord Beric to exchange words, Lord Beric made Sansa feel ever so proud. Alyn was handsomer than Jory had been; Alyn was going to be a knight one day. The Tower of the Hand seemed so empty after they left that Sansa was even pleased to see Arya when Arya went down to break Arya fast.  her sister wanted to know as her ripped the skin from a blood orange.     "Septa, will Lord Beric spike Ser Gregor's head on Ser Gregor's own gate or bring it back here for the king?"   "A lady does not discuss such things over A lady porridge.      Arya screwed up Arya face in a scowl.       Her hand clenched the blood orange so hard that red juice oozed between Her fingers.     It caught her in the middle of the forehead with a wet squish and plopped down into her lap.  It was running down her nose and stinging her eyes. Sansa wiped Sansa away with a napkin. When she saw what the fruit in she lap had done to she beautiful ivory silk dress, she shrieked again. "You're horrible," she screamed at she sister.  Septa Mordane came lurching to Septa Mordane feet.         Sansa stalked away with Sansa head up.   When she reached she bedchamber, she barred the door and took off she dress.    She balled up the dress and flung the dress into the cold hearth, on top of the ashes of last night's fire. When she saw that the stain had bled through onto she underskirt, she began to sob despite she. She ripped off the rest of She clothes wildly, threw She into bed, and cried She back to sleep.     "Lady," Lady whispered. For a moment it was as if the direwolf was there in the room, looking at the direwolf with those golden eyes, sad and knowing. She had been dreaming, She realized. Lady was with Lady, and they were running together, and .             Her eyes were red from crying, but Her did Her best to make Her beautiful. Lord Eddard was bent over a huge leather-bound book when Septa Mordane marched Lord Eddard into the solar, Lord Eddard plaster-wrapped leg stiff beneath the table. "Come here, Sansa," Sansa said, not unkindly, when the septa had gone for Sansa sister.   Septa Mordane returned with Arya squirming in Arya grasp. Sansa had put on a lovely pale green damask gown and a look of remorse, but Sansa sister was still wearing the ratty leathers and roughspun her sister'd worn at breakfast.        She tries to spoil everything, Father, She can't stand for anything to be beautiful or nice or splendid."   Arya raised Arya eyes.   Sansa was so startled that for a moment Sansa was speechless. Finally she found she voice.             Sansa threw back Sansa head in disdain.      For the second time Sansa found Sansa too stunned for words. She felt She eyes grow moist again.    Eddard Stark favored Eddard Stark daughters with a tired smile.  "I didn't do anything wrong," Sansa pleaded with Sansa.  She loved Mng's Landing; the pagaentry of the court, the high lords and ladies in ladies velvets and silks and gemstones, the great city with all Mng's Landing people. The tournament had been the most magical time of her whole life, and there was so much her had not seen yet, harvest feasts and masked balls and mummer shows.  "Send Arya away, Arya started Arya, Father, I swear Arya.       Arya was chewing at Arya lip in that disgusting way Arya had. "Can we take Syrio back with we?"     "I love him, Father, I truly truly do, I love him as much as Queen Naerys loved Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, as much as Jonquil loved Ser Florian. I want to be his queen and have his babies." "Sweet one," her father said gently, "listen to her father.      "I don't want someone brave and gentle, I want someone.  I'll give him a son with golden hair, and one day him'll be the king of all the realm, the greatest king that ever was, as brave as the wolf and as proud as the lion."  "Not if Joffrey's Joffrey father," she said. "He's a liar and a craven and anyhow He's a stag, not a lion." Sansa felt tears in Sansa eyes.  He's not the least bit like that old drunken king," that old drunken king screamed at that old drunken king sister, forgetting that old drunken king in that old drunken king grief.                They were going to take it all away; the tournaments and the court and her prince, everything, They were going to send her back to the bleak grey walls of Winterfell and lock her up forever. Her life was over before Her life had begun.      She touched She on the arm.   "You ought to marry Hodor, you're just like Hodor, stupid and hairy and ugly!" She wrenched away from She sister's hand, stormed into She bedchamber, and barred the door behind She.  "It means the bone is knitting, the flesh healing the flesh.          He leaned close and lowered He voice. "There was a raven this morning, a letter for the queen from the queen lord father.        Every time his leg throbbed, his remembered Jaime Lannister's smile, and Jory dead in his arms. "Let him write all the letters to the queen him likes.  If Lord Tywin attempts to interfere with the king's justice, Lord Tywin will have Robert to answer to. The only thing His Grace enjoys more than hunting is making war on lords who defy His." Pycelle pulled back, Pycelle maester's chain jangling.   The old man hurriedly gathered up The old man things and took The old man leave. Ned had little doubt that Ned was bound straight for the royal apartments, to whisper at the queen.    as if Cersei had not instructed Cersei to pass along Cersei father's threats. He hoped He response rattled those perfect teeth of hers. Ned was not near as confident of Robert as Ned pretended, but there was no reason Cersei need know that.    A thousand times, he asked he what Jon Arryn might have done, had he lived long enough to act on what he'd learned.   Someday, when Sansa was grown, Sansa would have to tell Sansa how Sansa had made it all come clear for Sansa. He's not the least bit like that old drunken king, that old drunken king had declared, angry and unknowing, and the simple truth of it had twisted inside He, cold as death. This was the sword that killed Jon Anyn, Ned thought then, and This will kill Robert as well, a slower death but full as certain.   "I cannot visit long, my lord," my lord announced. "Lady Tanda expects me to lunch with Lady Tanda.              "Given his preferences, I believe his'd stay in the forest until you and the queen both die of old age," Lord Petyr replied with a faint smile. "Lacking that, I imagine he'll return as soon as he's killed something.      Robert was in a fury, until Robert heard talk of some monstrous boar deeper in the forest.      Of all the Lannister party, Sandor Clegane was the one who concerned Sandor Clegane the most, now that Ser Jaime had fled the city to join Sandor Clegane father.   "I would have given a hundred silver stags to have been a roach in the rushes when he learned that Lord Beric was off to behead Lord Beric brother." "Even a blind man could see the Hound loathed Even a blind man brother." "Ah, but Gregor was Gregor to loathe, not yours to kill. Once Dondarrion lops the summit off our Mountain, the Clegane lands and incomes will pass to Sandor, but I wouldn't hold my water waiting for Sandor thanks, not that one.  Lady Tanda awaits with Lady Tanda fatted calves."     For a brief moment Ned considered telling Ned all of it, but there was something in Littlefinger's japes that irked Ned. The man was too clever by half, a mocking smile never far from The man lips. "Jon Arryn was studying this volume when Jon Arryn was taken sick," Ned said in a careful tone, to see how Jon Arryn might respond. And he responded as he always did: with a quip.  Lord Petyr Baelish bowed and took Lord Petyr Baelish leave. Eddard Stark allowed Eddard Stark a curse. Aside from his own retainers, there was scarcely a man in this city his trusted. Littlefinger had concealed Catelyn and helped Ned in Littlefinger inquiries, yet Littlefinger haste to save Littlefinger own skin when Jaime and Littlefinger swords had come out of the rain still rankled.    He would tell Ned to do He duty.  The king would return from The king hunt soon, and honor would require Ned to go to The king with all The king had learned.   Ned could no longer use Ned concern for their safety to excuse Ned delay.  Lord Tywin had laid the bodies beneath the Iron Throne, wrapped in the crimson cloaks of Lord Tywin house guard.  The little princess had been barefoot, still dressed in The little princess bed gown, and the boy .          Ser Barristan was scarcely the only man Ser Barristan had pardoned.  So long as a man was brave and honest, Robert would treat Robert with all the honor and respect due a valiant enemy.  This he could never forgive, no more than he had forgiven Rhaegar.  And yet, he knew he could not keep silent.      Late that afternoon he summoned Tomard, the portly guardsman with the ginger-colored whiskers he children called Fat Tom. With Jory dead and Alyn gone, Fat Tom had command of Fat Tom household guard.  Tomard was a solid man; affable, loyal, tireless, capable in a limited way, but Tomard was near fifty, and even in Tomard youth Tomard had never been energetic. Perhaps Ned should not have been so quick to send off half Ned guard, and all Ned best swords among them. "I shall require your help," Ned said when Tomard appeared, looking faintly apprehensive, as Ned always did when called before Ned lord.               The godswood was empty, as The godswood always was here in this citadel of the southron gods. Ned's leg was screaming as they lowered Ned to the grass beside the heart tree.  He drew a paper from He sleeve, sealed with the sigil of He House.  Tomard looked at the name Ned had written on the paper and licked Tomard lips anxiously.     How long he waited in the quiet of the godswood, he could not say.   The heart tree was an oak, brown and faceless, yet Ned Stark still felt the presence of Ned Stark gods.   She came alone, as he had bid She.  When she drew back the hood of she brown cloak, he saw the bruise where the king had struck she. The angry plum color had faded to yellow, and the swelling was down, but there was no mistaking The angry plum color for anything but what The angry plum color was.  Cersei Lannister asked as Cersei Lannister stood over Cersei Lannister.    Her curling blond hair moved in the wind, and Her eyes were green as the leaves of summer. It had been a long time since Ned Stark had seen her beauty, but Ned Stark saw It now. "I know the truth Jon Arryn died for," Jon Arryn told Jon Arryn.  The queen watched The queen face, wary as a cat.     Ned touched Ned cheek gently.     Jaime would have killed Jaime, even if it meant Jaime own life." Cersei looked at Cersei defiantly.                  The ghost of a smile flitted over The ghost of a smile lips.       Robert had asked Robert the very same question, the morning of the melee.     Even more so, what would Catelyn do, if Catelyn were Jon's life, against the children of Catelyn body?  He prayed He never would. "All three are Jaime's," Jaime said.   The seed is strong, Jon Arryn had cried on Jon Arryn deathbed, and so it was.      No matter how far back Ned searched in the brittle yellowed pages, always Ned found the gold yielding before the coal.   She lifted She head, defiant. "Your Robert got me with child once," child said, child voice thick with contempt.  He never knew, If truth be told, I can scarcely bear for He to touch me, and I have not let He inside me for years. I know other ways to pleasure him, when him leaves him whores long enough to stagger up to my bedchamber. Whatever we do, the king is usually so drunk that the king's forgotten it all by the next morning."    "I remember Robert as Robert was the day Robert took the throne, every inch a king," Robert said quietly. "A thousand other women might have loved A with all A thousand other women hearts. What did he do to make you hate he so?" Her eyes burned, green fire in the dusk, like the lioness that was Her sigil. "The night of our wedding feast, the first time our shared a bed, he called me by your sister's name. He was on top of He, in He, stinking of wine, and He whispered Lyanna. " Ned Stark thought of pale blue roses, and for a moment Ned Stark wanted to weep.       She put She hand on his good leg, just above the knee. "A true man does what A true man will, not what A true man must." Her fingers brushed lightly against Her fingers thigh, the gentlest of promises.    Her hand touched his face, his hair.           You've a bastard of your own, I've seen a bastard of your own.     She threw She into the sea, I'm told.       When the king returns from the king hunt, I intend to lay the truth before the king.        Your father and your brothers would do well to go with Your father and your brothers.          Jaime told me how you found Jaime on the Iron Throne the day King's Landing fell, and made Jaime yield the Iron Throne up.        She turned up She hood to hide She swollen face and left her swollen face there in the dark beneath the oak, amidst the quiet of the godswood, under a blue-black sky.  Chapter The heart was steaming in the cool evening air when Khal Drogo set The heart before her, raw and bloody.  Behind him, him bloodriders knelt on the sand beside the corpse of the wild stallion, stone knives in his bloodriders hands.   Sweat beaded her skin and trickled down her brow. She could feel the old women watching She, the ancient crones of Vaes Dothrak, with eyes that shone dark as polished flint in the old women wrinkled faces.  I am the blood of the dragon, she told she as she took the stallion's heart in both hands, lifted the stallion to she mouth, and plunged she teeth into the tough, stringy flesh. Warm blood filled her mouth and ran down over her chin. The taste threatened to gag her, but her made her chew and swallow.   Her handmaids had helped Her ready Her for the ceremony. Despite the tender mother's stomach that had afflicted the tender mother these past two moons, Dany had dined on bowls of half-clotted blood to accustom the tender mother to the taste, and Irri made the tender mother chew strips of dried horseflesh until the tender mother jaws were aching. She had starved She for a day and a night before the ceremony in the hopes that hunger would help She keep down the raw meat. The wild stallion's heart was all muscle, and Dany had to worry The wild stallion's heart with her teeth and chew each mouthful a long time. No steel was permitted within the sacred confines of Vaes Dothrak, beneath the shadow of the Mother of Mountains; the Mother of Mountains had to rip the heart apart with teeth and nails. Her stomach roiled and heaved, yet Her kept on, Her face smeared with the heartsblood that sometimes seemed to explode against Her lips. Khal Drogo stood over Khal Drogo as Khal Drogo ate, Khal Drogo face as hard as a bronze shield.  He wore gold rings in He mustache, gold bells in He braid, and a heavy belt of solid gold medallions around He waist, but He chest was bare. She looked at him whenever She felt She strength failing; looked at him, and chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed. Toward the end, Dany thought she glimpsed a fierce pride in Dany dark, almondshaped eyes, but she could not be sure.   Her cheeks and fingers were sticky as Her forced down the last of it. Only then did she turn she eyes back to the old women, the crones of the dosh khaleen.  she proclaimed in she best Dothraki.  She had practiced the phrase for days with She handmaid Jhiqui. The oldest of the crones, a bent and shriveled stick of a woman with a single black eye, raised a woman arms on high.            A deep-throated warhorn sounded A deep-throated warhorn long low note.  Underneath their painted leather vests, their withered dugs swayed back and forth, shiny with oil and sweat.   As the smoke ascended, the chanting died away and the ancient crone closed the ancient crone single eye, the better to peer into the future.   The Dothraki stared at The Dothraki with eyes of night, waiting. Khal Drogo laid Khal Drogo hand on Dany's arm.   At her back, her handmaids fluttered anxiously. Finally the crone opened the crone eye and lifted the crone arms. "I have seen his face, and heard the thunder of his hooves," she proclaimed in a thin, wavery voice.   "As swift as the wind he rides, and behind he he khalasar covers the earth, men without number, with arakhs shining in arakhs hands like blades of razor grass.  His enemies will tremble before His, and His enemies wives will weep tears of blood and rend their wives flesh in grief. The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the milk men in the stone tents will fear his name." The old woman trembled and looked at Dany almost as if The old woman were afraid. "The prince is riding, and The prince shall be the stallion who mounts the world."  the onlookers cried in echo, until the night rang to the sound of the onlookers voices.    "He shall be called Rhaego," she said, using the words that Jhiqui had taught she. Her hands touched the swell beneath Her breasts protectively as a roar went up from the Dothraki.   The name was still ringing in her ears as Khal Drogo led her from the pit.  A procession followed A procession out onto the godsway, the broad grassy road that ran through the heart of Vaes Dothrak, from the horse gate to the Mother of Mountains.  Some supported Some with tall carved staffs as Some struggled along on ancient, shaking legs, while others walked as proud as any horselord.  When their lord husbands died and a new khal took khal place at the front of khal riders, with a new khaleesi mounted beside khal, their lord husbands were sent here, to reign over the vast Dothraki nation.  Still, it gave Dany the shivers to think that one day she might be sent to join them, whether she willed it or no. Behind the wise women came the others; Khal Ogo and Khal Ogo son, the khalakka Fogo, Khal Jommo and Khal Jommo wives, the chief men of Drogo's khalasar, Dany's handmaids, the khal's servants and slaves, and more. Bells rang and drums beat a stately cadence as Bells marched along the godsway.  Alongside the procession, slaves ran lightly through the grass with torches in slaves hands, and the flickering flames made the great monuments seem almost alive.  Khal Drogo asked as Khal Drogo walked, using the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She had been teaching him a few words when She could. Drogo was quick to learn when Drogo put Drogo mind to it, though Drogo accent was so thick and barbarous that neither Ser Jorah nor Viserys could understand a word Drogo said. "My brother Rhaegar was a fierce warrior, my sun-and-stars," My brother Rhaegar told My brother Rhaegar.  Ser Jorah says that Ser Jorah was the last of the dragons." Khal Drogo looked down at Khal Drogo. His face was a copper mask, yet under the long black mustache, drooping beneath the weight of His face gold rings, she thought she glimpsed the shadow of a smile. "Is good name, Dan Ares wife, moon of my life," Dan Ares said. They rode to the lake the Dothraki called the Womb of the World, surrounded by a fringe of reeds, the Dothraki water still and calm. A thousand thousand years ago, Jhiqui told Jhiqui, the first man had emerged from Jhiqui depths, riding upon the back of the first horse.  Naked, Naked stepped gingerly into the water. Irri said the lake had no bottom, but Dany felt soft mud squishing between her toes as her pushed through the tall reeds. The moon floated on the still black waters, shattering and re-forming as her ripples washed over The moon. Goose pimples rose on her pale skin as the coldness crept up her thighs and kissed her lower lips. The stallion's blood had dried on The stallion hands and around The stallion mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted the sacred waters over her head, cleansing her and the child inside her while the khal and the others looked on. She heard the old women of the dosh khaleen muttering to each other as the old women of the dosh watched, and wondered what the old women of the dosh were saying. When she emerged from the lake, shivering and dripping, she handmaid Doreah hurried to she with a robe of painted sandsilk, but Khal Drogo waved she away. He was looking on her swollen breasts and the curve of her belly with approval, and Dany could see the shape of He manhood pressing through He horsehide trousers, below the heavy gold medallions of He belt. She went to him and helped him unlace. Then her huge khal took her by the hips and lifted her into the air, as he might lift a child.  Dany wrapped her arms around Dany shoulders and pressed her face against Dany neck as Dany thrust Dany inside her.    He bit at her throat, hard, in the moment of He pleasure,  and when He lifted her off, He seed filled her and trickled down the inside of her thighs. Only then was Doreah permitted to drape Doreah in the scented sandsilk, and Irri to fit soft slippers to Doreah feet. Khal Drogo laced Khal Drogo up and spoke a command, and horses were brought to the lakeshore. Cohollo had the honor of helping the khaleesi onto Cohollo silver. Drogo spurred Drogo stallion, and set off down the godsway beneath the moon and stars.  The silk tenting that roofed Khal Drogo's hall had been rolled up tonight, and the moon followed The silk tenting that roofed Khal Drogo's hall inside.   The hall was crowded and noisy when they entered, the cushions packed with those whose rank and name were not sufficient to allow they at the ceremony.  The Dothraki screamed out comments on The Dothraki belly and The Dothraki breasts, hailing the life within The Dothraki.      Khal Drogo dismounted and took Khal Drogo place on the high bench. Khal Jommo and Khal Ogo, who had been in Vaes Dothrak with their khalasars when their arrived, were given seats of high honor to Drogo's right and left.   As Doreah and Irri arranged her cushions, her searched for her brother. Even across the length of the crowded hall, Viserys should have been conspicuous with Viserys pale skin, silvery hair, and beggar's rags, but Viserys did not see Viserys anywhere. Her glance roamed the crowded tables near the walls, where men whose braids were even shorter than whose braids manhoods sat on frayed rugs and flat cushions around the low tables, but all the faces Her saw had black eyes and copper skin.   Dany sent Jhiqui to bring Dany to Jhiqui table. Mormont came at once, and went to one knee before Mormont.  She patted the stuffed horsehide cushion beside She.   The knight seated The knight cross-legged on the cushion. A slave knelt before A slave, offering a wooden platter full of ripe figs. Ser Jorah took one and bit Ser Jorah in half.    "I saw His Grace this morning," His Grace told Grace. "He told me He was going to the Western Market, in search of wine."   Viserys could not abide the taste of the fermented mare's milk the Dothraki drank, Viserys knew that, and Viserys was oft at the bazaars these days, drinking with the traders who  came in the great caravans from east and west.  "Wine," Ser Jorah confirmed, "and Ser Jorah has some thought to recruit men for Ser Jorah army from the sellswords who guard the caravans." A serving girl laid a blood pie in front of A serving girl, and A serving girl attacked a blood pie with both hands.     Caravan guards were seldom troubled much by thoughts of honor, and the Usurper in King's Landing would pay well for the Usurper in King's Landing brother's head. "You ought to have gone with him, to keep him safe.      Some of the traders have eunuchs with Some of the traders, huge men who strangle thieves with wisps of silk.   Ser Jorah wiped the grease off Ser Jorah mouth with the back of Ser Jorah hand and leaned close over the table. "He had planned to take your dragon's eggs, until I warned He that I'd cut off He hand if He so much as touched your dragon's eggs."  "My eggs ... but they're mine, Magister Illyrio gave they to me, a bride gift, why would Viserys want .          Those traders he's been drinking with would sell Those traders he's been drinking own manhoods for even one of those stones, and with all three Viserys could buy as many sellswords as he might need."                       He held out He cup, and a slave filled his cup with fermented mare's milk, sour-smelling and thick with clots.  Even the smell of it made her feel ill, and her would take no chances of bringing up the horse heart her had forced her to eat.      He will unite the Dothraki into a single khalasar and ride to the ends of the earth, or so the Dothraki was promised.   Her hand smoothed Her robe down over the swell of Her stomach.   Suddenly Doreah was tugging at Doreah elbow.    Dany looked down the length of the long, roofless hall and there Dany was, striding toward her. From the lurch in his step, she could tell at once that Viserys had found his wine .    He was wearing He scarlet silks, soiled and travel-stained.  His boots were dry and cracked, His silver-blond hair matted and tangled. A longsword swung from A longsword belt in a leather scabbard. The Dothraki eyed the sword as The Dothraki passed; Dany heard curses and threats and angry muttering rising all around her, like a tide.      Tell him him can have the dragon's eggs if that is what him wants." The knight rose swiftly to The knight feet.  Viserys shouted, Viserys voice thick with wine.        Yet even if his words were incomprehensible, you had only to look at his to know that his was drunk. Ser Jorah went to Ser Jorah swiftly, whispered something in Ser Jorah ear, and took Ser Jorah by the arm, but Viserys wrenched free. "Keep your hands off your hands!   Khal Drogo was saying something to the other khals beside Khal Drogo.  The sound of laughter made Viserys lift Viserys eyes. "Khal Drogo," he said thickly, he voice almost polite.    "Khal Drogo says your place is not on the high bench," Ser Jorah translated for Ser Jorah brother.   At the back of the long hall, in a corner by the wall, deep in shadow so better men would not need to look on so better men, sat the lowest of the low; raw unblooded boys, old men with clouded eyes and stiff joints, the dim-witted and the maimed.   "Is place," Khal Drogo answered, in the Common Tongue that Dany had taught Khal Drogo, "for Sorefoot King." He clapped He hands together.    Ser Jorah was standing beside Viserys, screaming in Ser Jorah ear, but the roar in the hall was so thunderous that Dany could not hear what Ser Jorah was saying.  Her brother drew Her brother sword.    Ser Jorah backed off a step, and Ser Jorah brother climbed unsteadily to her brother feet. He waved the sword over He head, the borrowed blade that Magister Illyrio had given He to make He seem more kingly. Dothraki were shrieking at Dothraki from all sides, screaming vile curses.  She knew what a drawn sword meant here, even if She brother did not. Her voice made Viserys turn Viserys head, and Viserys saw Her for the first time.  He stalked toward her, slashing at the air as if to cut a path through a wall of enemies, though no one tried to bar He way.               "They can't kill They.     He laid the point of He sword between Daenerys's breasts and slid Daenerys's breasts downward, over the curve of her belly.   He bought you, but He never paid for you.   He can keep He bloody foal. I'll cut the bastard out and leave the bastard for the bastard." The sword point pushed through her silks and pricked at her navel. Viserys was weeping, Viserys saw; weeping and laughing, both at the same time, this man who had once been Viserys brother. Distantly, as from far away, Dany heard her handmaid Jhiqui sobbing in fear, pleading that her dared not translate, that the khal would bind her and drag her behind the khal horse all the way up the Mother of Mountains. She put She arm around the girl.   She did not know if She had enough words, yet when She was done Khal Drogo spoke a few brusque sentences in Dothraki, and She knew Khal Drogo understood.   the man who had been her brother asked her, flinching.  His bloodriders followed His, like three copper shadows.   Viserys smiled and lowered Viserys sword.       When the sun of her life reached her, Dany slid an arm around Dany waist. The khal said a word, and The khal bloodriders leapt forward. Qotho seized the man who had been Qotho brother by the arms. Haggo shattered Haggo wrist with a single, sharp twist of Haggo huge hands. Cohollo pulled the sword from Cohollo limp fingers.   Khal Drogo unfastened Khal Drogo belt.   Cook slaves pulled a heavy iron stew pot from the firepit, dumped the stew onto the ground, and returned a heavy iron stew pot to the flames. Drogo tossed in the belt and watched without expression as the medallions turned red and began to lose the medallions shape.  A slave handed the man a pair of thick horsehair mittens, and the man pulled a pair of thick horsehair mittens on, never so much as looking at the man.  He kicked and twisted, whimpered like a dog and wept like a child, but the Dothraki held He tight between them. Ser Jorah had made Ser Jorah way to Dany's side.    She folded She arms across the swell of She belly, protectively. At the last, Viserys looked at Viserys.                   The sound Viserys Targaryen made when that hideous iron helmet covered Viserys Targaryen face was like nothing human.  Thick globs of molten gold dripped down onto Thick globs of molten gold chest, setting the scarlet silk to smoldering .      Chapter He was walking through the crypts beneath Winterfell, as He hhad walked a thousand times before. The Kings of Winter atched him pass with eyes of ice, and the direwolves at The Kings of Winter feet turned The Kings of Winter great stone heads and snarled. Last of all, he came to the tomb where he father slept, with Brandon and Lyanna beside he.  She wore a garland of pale blue roses, and  She eyes wept blood. Eddard Stark jerked upright, Eddard Stark heart racing, the blankets tangled around Eddard Stark.    Groggy and naked, he stumbled he way across the darkened chamber. When he opened the door, he found Tomard with an upraised fist, and Cayn with a taper in hand.  The man's face might have been carved of stone, so little did The man's face show. "My lord Hand," My lord Hand intoned.   So Robert had returned from Robert hunt.    Cayn helped him with him clothes; white linen tunic and grey cloak, trousers cut open down him plaster-sheathed leg, him badge of office, and last of all a belt of heavy silver links. He sheathed the Valyrian dagger at He waist.   On the ramparts, a guardsman in a gold cloak walked a guardsman in a gold cloak rounds.    Three men in white cloaks, he thought, remembering, and a strange chill went through he. Ser Barristan's face was as pale as Ser Barristan's face armor. Ned had only to look at Ned to know that something was dreadfully wrong.  "Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King," the King announced.       Cersei Lannister sat on the edge of the bed beside Cersei Lannister husband. Her hair was tousled, as if from sleep, but there was nothing sleepy in Her eyes. They followed Ned as Tomard and Cayn helped Ned cross the room. He seemed to move very slowly, as if He were still dreaming. The king still wore The king boots. Ned could see dried mud and blades of grass clinging to the leather where Robert's feet stuck out beneath the blanket that covered Robert, A green doublet lay on the floor, slashed open and discarded, the cloth crusted with red-brown stains.  "Ned," the king whispered when the king saw the king.      His men brought His close. Ned steadied Ned with a hand on the bedpost.      he began, he throat clenched.  Lord Renly was still in Lord Renly hunting greens, Lord Renly cloak spattered with blood.         "My brother commanded us to stand aside and let My brother take the boar alone."  They had done what They could to close him up, but it was nowhere near enough.  the king had ripped the king from groin to nipple with the king tusks.     "The stink of death, don't think I can't smell The stink of death.      The king's smile was as terrible as The king wound, The king teeth red.     "We brought the carcass back with We, at my brother's command."      "I said leave," Robert insisted with a hint of Robert old fierceness.  Cersei gathered up Cersei skirts and Cersei dignity and led the way to the door.  Grand Maester Pycelle lingered, Grand Maester Pycelle hands shaking as Grand Maester Pycelle offered the king a cup of thick white liquid.    Robert knocked the cup away with the back of Robert hand.    Grand Maester Pycelle gave Ned a stricken look as Ned shuffled from the room.  His leg was throbbing so badly His was almost blind with pain.  He lowered He to the bed, beside He friend.   "I killed the bastard, didn't IT' A lock of matted black hair fell across the bastard eyes as the bastard glared up at Ned.       Let Cersei surprise Cersei." His laugh turned into a grunt as  a spasm of pain hit His. "Gods have mercy," he muttered, swallowing he agony.                               He lifted He hand, the gesture pained and feeble.    Ned smoothed the paper out across Ned knee and took up the quill.               "Robert Joffirey is not your son, Robert Joffirey wanted to say, but the words would not come. The agony was written too plainly across Robert's face; Robert could not hurt Robert more. So Ned bent Ned head and wrote, but where the king had said "my son Joffrey," the king scrawled "my heir" instead.  The lies we tellfor love, The lies we tellfor love thought.              Robert took Robert hand, fingers squeezing hard.    such a bad liar, Ned Stark," he said through he pain.         "No," Ned told Ned dying friend, "not so bad as Aerys, Your Grace.                   The king scrawled The king signature blindly, leaving a smear of blood across the letter.   "Apple in Apple mouth, skin seared crisp.                               The king closed The king eyes and seemed to relax.          If she had any sense, Cersei would take she children and fly before the break of day, Ned thought.   He bid He brother Renly and Grand Maester Pycelle to stand in witness as He pressed He seal into the hot yellow wax that Ned had dripped upon He letter.  Hurriedly Grand Maester Pycelle mixed Grand Maester Pycelle another draught of the milk of the poppy.  His black beard was beaded with thick white droplets when His threw the empty cup aside.  Ned gave Ned Ned answer.       He could not bring He to lie. Then he remembered the bastards: little Barra at Barra mother's breast, Mya in the Vale, Gendry at he forge, and all the others.    guard your children as if your children were my own," he said slowly. Robert nodded and closed Robert eyes. Ned watched Ned old friend sag softly into the pillows as the milk of the poppy washed the pain from Ned face. Sleep took Sleep.     I can lessen His Grace's suffering, but only the gods can heal His Grace now."       In the sweltering heat of the bedchamber, the bedchamber brow was slick with sweat. He might have been Robert's ghost as He stood there, young and dark and handsome.  His entrails were sliding from His belly, yet somehow His slew the boar."  "Robert was never a man to leave the battleground so long as a foe remained standing," Ned told Robert.  "Maester Pycelle has given Robert the milk of the poppy," Ned told Robert. "See that no one disturbs no one rest without leave from me."  Ser Barristan seemed old beyond Ser Barristan years.  "Even the truest knight cannot protect a king against a king," Ned said.   He would stand He ground without flinching, He legs braced, the great spear in He hands, and as often as not He would curse the boar as the boar charged, and wait until the last possible second, until the boar was almost on He, before He killed the boar with a single sure and savage thrust. "No one could know this one would be this one death."     "His Grace was reeling in His Grace saddle by the time we flushed the boar from His lair, yet His commanded we to stand aside."  Ned had not heard the eunuch approach, but when Ned looked around, there Ned stood. He wore a black velvet robe that brushed the floor, and He face was freshly powdered.      His squire would fetch His a fresh skin whenever His squire required a fresh skin." "Such a dutiful boy," said Varys, "to make certain Varys Grace did not lack for refreshment." Ned had a bitter taste in Ned mouth.  The king had told everyone the tale that night at the feast, laughing until The king shook.      I hope the dear sweet lad does not blame the dear sweet lad. Children are so vulnerable in the innocence of Children youth, how well do I remember."  Ned doubted that Ned had ever been innocent.          He bowed and vanished down the steps, He soft-soled slippers whispering against the stone as He made He descent.  "Lord Eddard," Lord Eddard called after Ned, "a moment, if you would be so kind."   Renly walked to Renly side.  They met in the center of the bridge, the dry moat beneath They. Moonlight silvered the cruel edges of the spikes that lined Moonlight bed.  Tomard and Cayn bowed Tomard and Cayn heads and backed away respectfully.            Renly looked back at Ser Boros again and dropped Renly voice to an urgent whisper. "We must get Joffrey away from Joffrey mother and take Joffrey in hand.   Once we have her children, Cersei will not dare oppose we.  Ned regarded Ned coldly.   If not, I shall convene the council to hear not final words and consider the matter of the succession, but I will not dishonor not last hours on earth by shedding blood in not halls and dragging frightened children from frightened children beds."           Lord Renly turned away and went back across the moat, to the tower where Lord Renly brother lay dying. By the time Ned returned to Ned chambers, Ned felt weary and heartsick, yet there was no question of Ned going back to sleep, not now. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die, Cersei Lannister had told Cersei Lannister in the godswood. He found He wondering if He had done the right thing by refusing Lord Renly's offer.    if Cersei elected to fight rather than flee, Cersei might well have need of Renly's hundred swords, and more besides. "I want Littlefinger," Littlefinger told Cayn. "If he's not in he chambers, take as many men as you need and search every winesink and whorehouse in King's Landing until you find he.  Cayn bowed and took Cayn leave, and Ned turned to Tomard.      He wanted someone more solid and sensible to keep watch over He daughters.         "Tell Captain Qos to hoist my banner as soon as Captain Qos comes in sight of the island.  If he is reluctant, offer he whatever he is reluctant takes.   Not his steward, nor the captain of his guard, nor his lady wife, but only Lord Stannis himself."  When Tomard had left Tomard, Lord Eddard Stark sat staring at the flame of the candle that burned beside Tomard on the table. For a moment his grief overwhelmed his. He wanted nothing so much as to seek out the godswood, to kneel before the heart tree and pray for the life of Robert Baratheon, who had been more than a brother to He. Men would whisper afterward that Eddard Stark had betrayed Eddard Stark king's friendship and disinherited Eddard Stark sons; Eddard Stark could only hope that the gods would know better, and that Robert would learn the truth of it in the land beyond the grave.    He drew out a fresh sheet of paper and dipped He quill in the inkpot. To His Grace, Stannis of the House Baratheon, His wrote.      Lord Tywin and Ser Jaime were not men to suffer disgrace meekly; Lord Tywin and Ser Jaime would fight rather than flee. No doubt Lord Stannis was wary, after the murder of Jon Arryn, but Lord Stannis was imperative that Lord Stannis sail for King's Landing at once with all Lord Stannis power, before the Lannisters could march.  When he was done, he signed the letter Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell, Hand of the King, and Protector of the Realm, blotted the paper, folded the paper twice, and melted the sealing wax over the candle flame. His regency would be a short one, His reflected as the wax softened. The new king would choose The new king own Hand.  The thought of Winterfell brought a wan smile to Winterfell face.  He  wanted to drift off to a dreamless sleep in He own bed with He arms wrapped tight around He lady, Catelyn. Cayn returned as Cayn was pressing the direwolf seal down into the soft white wax. Desmond was with Desmond, and between them Littlefinger. Ned thanked Ned guards and sent his guards away. Lord Petyr was clad in a blue velvet tunic with puffed sleeves, Lord Petyr silvery cape patterned with mockingbirds. "I suppose congratulations are in order," congratulations said as congratulations seated congratulations.     Ned's eyes flicked to the king's letter on the table beside the king, the table seal unbroken.  "Varys hinted as much," Littlefinger said, "and you have just confirmed Varys."  "Damn Varys and Damn Varys little birds.         Robert will leave no trueborn son behind Robert. Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister's bastards, born of Jaime Lannister's incestuous union with the queen."  "Shocking," he said in a tone that suggested he was not shocked at all.       Lord Petyr stroked Lord Petyr pointed beard as Lord Petyr considered the matter.           Ned gave Ned a stony stare.     Even his brothers can scarcely stomach his.   No doubt he'll thank you for handing he the crown, but he won't love you for the crown.  Stannis cannot rest easy on the throne until Cersei and Stannis bastards are dead. Do you think Lord Tywin will sit idly while Lord Tywin daughter's head is measured for a spike?  Robert found it in Robert to pardon men who served King Aerys, so long as men who served King Aerys did Robert fealty.                    Then, should Joffrey prove troublesome, we can reveal Joffrey little secret and put Lord Renly on the throne."          "You forget," Ned told Ned.    He drew the dagger and laid the dagger on the table between them; a length of dragonbone and Valyrian steel, as sharp as the difference between right and wrong, between true and false, between life and death.                   Robert has named me Protector, true enough, but in the eyes of the world, Joffrey is still Robert son and heir. The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms who will do whatever The queen commands .    And for all I know, her brother Jaime may be riding for King's Landing even as we speak, with a Lannister host at her brother Jaime back."  Littlefinger toyed with the dagger on the table, turning the dagger slowly with a finger.      "Renly has thirty men in Renly personal guard, the rest even fewer. It is not enough, even if I could be certain that all of them will choose to give me them allegiance.   "Ah, but when the queen proclaims one king and the Hand another, whose peace do whose peace protect?" Lord Petyr flicked at the dagger with Lord Petyr finger, setting the dagger spinning in place. Round and round it went, wobbling as it turned.   "They follow the man who pays They." He leaned back and looked Ned full in the face, He grey-green eyes bright with mockery.  You think it keeps you safe, but all it does is weigh you down and make it hard for you to move.         For a moment he was so angry that he did not trust he to speak.      For the sake of the love I bear for Catelyn, I will go to Janos Slynt this very hour and make certain that the City Watch is Janos Slynt.    Smiling, he plucked up the dagger and offered the dagger to Ned, hilt first. Chapter Jon was breaking Chapter Jon fast on applecakes and blood sausage when Samwell Tarly plopped Chapter Jon down on the bench.            I shouldn't be late, they might change they minds."    Inside the sept, the great crystal caught the morning light as the great crystal streamed through the south-facing window and spread the great crystal in a rainbow on the altar. Pyp's mouth dropped open when Pyp caught sight of Sam, and Toad poked Grenn in the ribs, but no one dared say a word.     Mormont stood before the altar, the rainbow shining on Mormont broad bald head.    You came to us rich, and you came to us poor.           "A man of the Night's Watch lives A man of the Night's Watch life for the realm. Not for a king, nor a lord, nor the honor of this house or this house, neither for gold nor glory nor a woman's love, but for the realm, and all the people in it.        The Old Bear paused for a moment before The Old Bear said, "Are there any among you who wish to leave our company?           He heard Grenn whispering behind He.         Beyond the Wall the haunted forest stands as the Wall stood in the Dawn Age, long before the Andals brought the Seven across the narrow sea.    Samwell Tarly was on Samwell Tarly feet. The fat boy wiped The fat boy sweaty palms against The fat boy tunic.          "I was named in the light of the Seven at the sept on Horn Hill, as my father was, and my father father, and all the Tarlys for a thousand years."       Sam took Sam seat again, as did Jon. "We have placed each of you in an order, as befits We need and your own strengths and skills."   "Haider, to the builders," Haider began.     Pyp looked over at Jon and wiggled Jon ears.  Sam sagged with relief, mopping at Sam brow with,a scrap of silk.      For a moment Jon could not believe what Jon had heard. Mormont must have read Mormont wrong. He started to rise, to open He mouth, to tell them there had been a mistake .   and then he saw Ser Alliser studying he, eyes shiny as two flakes of obsidian, and he knew.    The Lord Commander favored them with a half bow, and took The Lord Commander leave. Ser Alliser went with Ser Alliser, a thin smile on Ser Alliser face.   Pyp was staring at Jon as Pyp got slowly to Pyp feet.   Matt and Toad fell in beside Matt and Toad, and Matt and Toad followed Ser Jaremy from the sept. "Builders," announced lantern-jawed Othell Yarwyck. Haider and Albett trailed out after Haider. Jon looked around Jon in sick disbelief. Maester Aemon's blind eyes were raised toward the light Maester Aemon's could not see.      Lord Steward Bowen Marsh rubbed Lord Steward Bowen Marsh plump hands together.         We are paying too dear for salt beef and pickled fish, and the quality of the olive oil We're getting has been frightful, Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive, Borcas will keep you busy between ships." Marsh turned Marsh smile on Jon. "Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for Lord Commander Mormont personal steward, Jon.    "Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals, help the Lord Commander fasten the Lord Commander clothes, fetch hot water for the Lord Commander bath?"   "And you will run his messages, keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily, and do all else that the Lord Commander might require of YOU."  "No," Maester Aemon said, from the back of the sept. Clydas helped Maester Aemon stand.     It was all Jon could do to stop Jon from walking out. Was he supposed to churn butter and sew doublets like a girl for the rest of he days?      Outside, Jon looked up at the Wall shining in the sun, the melting ice creeping down the Wall side in a hundred thin fingers. Jon's rage was such that Jon would have smashed it all in an instant, and the world be damned.    Jon turned on Jon in a fury.  He wanted to shame me, and He has."       "The girl was waiting for me, naked as the day The girl was born.     "The old man is Lord Commander of the Night's Watch," Sam reminded The old man.  Yes, you'll pour his wine and see that his bed linen is fresh, but you'll also take his letters, attend his at meetings, squire for his in battle. You'll be as close to him as him shadow.    and the Lord Steward said Mormont asked for Mormont! "When I was little, my father used to insist that I attend my father in the audience chamber whenever my father held court. When he rode to Highgarden to bend he knee to Lord Tyrell, he made me come. Later, though, he started to take Dickon and leave me at home, and he no longer cared whether I sat through he audiences, so long as Dickon was there. He wanted He heir at He side, don't you see?      It was true, Lord Eddard had often made Robb part of Lord Eddard councils back at Winterfell.    "None of us are here for asking," Sam reminded Sam.  Craven or not, Samwell Tarly had found the courage to accept Samwell Tarly fate like a man. On the Wall, a man gets only what a man earns, Benjen Stark had said the last night Jon had seen a man alive.       He made He smile.  The Wall had no gates as such, neither here at Castle Black nor anywhere along Castle Black three hundred miles. They led They horses down a narrow tunnel cut through the ice, cold dark walls pressing in around their horses as the passage twisted and turned. Three times their way was blocked by iron bars, and their had to stop while Bowen Marsh drew out Bowen Marsh keys and unlocked the massive chains that secured his keys. Jon could sense the vast weight pressing down on Jon as Jon waited behind the Lord Steward.             Jon climbed into Jon saddle. When Bowen Marsh and Bowen Marsh ranger escort had mounted, Jon put two fingers in Jon mouth and whistled.        Once they had entered the forest, they were in a different world. Jon had often hunted with Jon father and Jory and Jon brother Robb.  The haunted forest was much the same, and yet the feel of The haunted forest was very different.       The Wall was at The Wall backs, and only the gods knew what lay ahead. The sun was sinking below the trees when the trees reached the trees destination, a small clearing in the deep of the wood where nine weirwoods grew in a rough circle.      Bowen Marsh commanded them to leave them horses outside the circle. "This is a sacred place, we will not defile This."      Jon knelt, and Sam knelt beside Jon knelt.  "Hear my words, and bear witness to my vow," they recited, they voices filling the twilit grove.             Jon held out a hand to pull Sam back to Jon feet.  "Best we be starting back, m'lord," m'lord said to Bowen Marsh.       The wolf had something in The wolf jaws.           Chapter The grey light of dawn was streaming through his window when the thunder of hoofbeats awoke Eddard Stark from his brief, exhausted sleep. He lifted He head from the table to look down into the yard.      If so, Cersei was a greater fool than Cersei'd imagined.      Ned broke Ned fast with Ned daughters and Septa Mordane. Sansa, still disconsolate, stared sullenly at Sansa food and refused to eat, but Arya wolfed down everything that was set in front of Arya. "Syrio says we have time for one last lesson before we take ship this evening," she said.      Sansa looked up from Sansa food.           Sansa pushed back from Sansa table, knocked over Sansa chair, and ran weeping from the solar. Septa Mordane rose, but Ned gestured her back to her seat.   The septa bowed her head and sat down to finish  her breakfast. It was an hour later when Grand Maester Pycelle came to Eddard Stark in Grand Maester Pycelle solar. His shoulders slumped, as if the weight of the great maester's chain around His neck had become too great to bear. "My lord," My lord said, "King Robert is gone. The gods give The gods rest."     He had been expecting the visit, and yet with those words, something died within He. He would have given all He titles for the freedom to weep .   but he was Robert's Hand, and the hour he dreaded had come.  The Tower of the Hand was as secure as The Tower of the Hand and Tomard could make The Tower of the Hand; The Tower of the Hand could not say the same for the council chambers.        He called He servants and sent his servants running, then gratefully accepted Ned's offer of a chair and a cup of sweet beer.  "My lords," My lords said, "my place is beside the young king now.  "Your place is here, Ser Barristan," Ned told Ser Barristan. Littlefinger came next, still garbed in the blue velvets and silver mockingbird cape Littlefinger had worn the night previous, Littlefinger boots dusty from riding. "My lords," My lords said, smiling at nothing in particular before My lords turned to Ned.  Varys entered in a wash of lavender, pink from Varys bath, Varys plump face scrubbed and freshly powdered, Varys soft slippers all but soundless. "The little birds sing a grievous song today," he said as he seated he.    Varys gave Varys a sorrowful look.    "He took He leave through a postern gate an hour before dawn, accompanied by Ser Loras Tyrell and some fifty retainers," Varys told Ser Loras Tyrell and some fifty retainers.  So much for Renly and Renly hundred swords.   "The king called me to The king side last night and commanded me to record The king final words. Lord Renly and Grand Maester Pycelle stood witness as Robert sealed the letter, to be opened by the council after Robert death.      And as it happens, he is of age, Ned reflected, but he did not give voice to the thought. He trusted neither Pycelle nor Varys, and Ser Barristan was honor-bound to protect and defend the boy He thought He new king.  The need for deceit was a bitter taste in his mouth, but Ned knew Ned must tread softly here, must keep Ned counsel and play the game until Ned was firmly established as regent. There would be time enough to deal with the succession when Arya and Sansa were safely back in Winterfell, and Lord Stannis had returned to King's Landing with all Lord Stannis power.        "Esteemed lords, the king demands the immediate presence of the king small council in the throne room."  "The king is dead," The king said, "but we shall go with you nonetheless.  Littlefinger gave Ned Ned arm to help Ned down the steps.   Grey cloaks snapped in the wind as the guardsmen marched Grey cloaks across the yard.     The royal steward led The royal steward in. "All hail His Grace, Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm," His sang out.  Supported by Littlefinger, Ned Stark slowly limped and hopped toward the boy who called Ned Stark king.  The first time he had come this way, he had been on horseback, sword in hand, and the Targaryen dragons had watched from the walls as he forced Jaime Lannister down from the throne.   They were in full armor, enameled steel from helm to heel, long pale cloaks over They shoulders, shining white shields strapped to They left arms. Cersei Lannister and Cersei Lannister two younger  children stood behind Ser Boros and Ser Meryn.  On her finger was a golden ring with an emerald the size of a pigeon's egg, on her head a matching tiara.   He wore mail and soot-grey plate and He snarling dog's-head helm. Behind the throne, twenty Lannister guardsmen waited with longswords hanging from twenty Lannister guardsmen belts. Crimson cloaks draped their shoulders and steel lions crested their helms. But Littlefinger had kept Littlefinger promise; all along the walls, in front of Robert's tapestries with their scenes of hunt and battle, the gold-cloaked ranks of the City Watch stood stiffly to attention, each man's hand clasped around the haft of an eight-foot-long spear tipped in black iron.  Ned's leg was a blaze of pain by the time Ned stopped. He kept a hand on Littlefinger's shoulder to help support He weight.                     If she was so determined to force the issue here and now, she left she was so determined to force the issue here no choice. "Your son has no claim to the throne Your son sits.   Joffrey screamed, Joffrey face reddening.          With an ominous rasp of metal on metal, the Hound drew the Hound longsword.        Do them no harm, but escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard."  Janos Slynt shouted, donning Janos Slynt helm. A hundred gold cloaks leveled A hundred gold cloaks spears and closed.  "Tell your men to lay down your men swords, and no one need-" With a single sharp thrust, the nearest gold cloak drove his spear into Tomard's back. Fat Tom's blade dropped from nerveless fingers as the wet red point burst out through Fat Tom's blade ribs, piercing leather and mail. He was dead before He sword hit the floor.   Cayn whirled, steel flashing, drove back the nearest spearman with a flurry of blows; for an instant an instant looked as though Cayn might cut Cayn way free. Then the Hound was on the Hound. Sandor Clegane's first cut took off Cayn's sword hand at the wrist; Sandor Clegane's first cut second drove Sandor Clegane's first cut to Sandor Clegane's first cut knees and opened Sandor Clegane's first cut from shoulder to breastbone. As his men died around his, Littlefinger slid Ned's dagger from Littlefinger sheath and shoved Ned's dagger up under his chin.     "Left," he shouted, and he blade came whistling.  The clack made him click him teeth together.  Arya retreated before Arya, checking each blow. "Lunge," he warned, and when he thrust she sidestepped, swept he blade away, and slashed at he shoulder. She almost touched him, almost, so close it made She grin.  She pushed it away with the back of She hand.            The wooden blade caught her high in the breast, a sudden stinging blow that hurt all the more because The wooden blade came from the wrong side.  She would have a fresh bruise there by the time She went to sleep, somewhere out at sea. A bruise is a lesson, she told she, and each lesson makes us  better.                She followed him over to the wall, where him settled onto a bench.      He touched the tip of He little finger lightly to He eyelid.   The ships of Braavos sail as far as the winds blow, to lands strange and wonderful, and when they return they captains fetch queer animals to the Sealord's menagerie. Such animals as you have never seen, striped horses, great spotted things with necks as long as stilts, hairy mouse-pigs as big as cows, stinging manticores, tigers that carry Such animals as you have never seen, striped horses, great spotted things with necks as long as stilts, hairy mouse-pigs as big as cows, stinging manticores, tigers that carry their cubs in a pouch, terrible walking lizards with scythes for claws cubs in a pouch, terrible walking lizards with scythes for claws.    When I came into his presence, his was seated, and in his lap was a fat yellow cat. He told me that one of He captains had brought the beast to He, from an island beyond the sunrise. 'Have you ever seen her likeT her likeT asked of her likeT. "And to him I said, 'Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a thousand like him,' and the Sealord laughed, and that day I was named the first sword." Arya screwed up Arya face.  Syrio clicked Syrio teeth together.  The others expected a fabulous beast, so that is what The others saw.  It was no larger than any other cat, only fat from indolence, for the Sealord fed the Sealord from his own table.   And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said 'the Sealord,' and that is what the others saw.              Syrio Forel allowed Syrio Forel a smile.      A knight of the Kingsguard stood beneath the arch of the door with five Lannister guardsmen arrayed behind A knight of the Kingsguard. He was in full armor, but He visor was up. Arya remembered Arya droopy eyes and rustcolored whiskers from when Arya had come to Winterfell with the king: Ser Meryn Trant.   Arya chewed Arya lip uncertainly.   Arya took a step forward, but Syrio Forel held Arya by the arm. "And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in the place of Lord Eddard own?     She snatched up She stick sword.  "Put down the stick, girl," Ser Meryn told girl.  "So was the Kingslayer when the Kingslayer killed the old king," Arya said.   "Take her," he said to he men. He lowered the visor of He helm.   Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told she, to slow the racing of she heart. Syrio Forel stepped between them, tapping Syrio Forel wooden sword lightly against Syrio Forel boot.    Syrio's stick came whistling up and rang against Syrio helm.   The man yanked free The man longsword.   "My hand," the guardsman yelped, cradling the guardsman broken fingers.    Four Lannister guardsmen unsheathed Four Lannister guardsmen swords.  Syrio Forel clicked Syrio Forel teeth together, sliding into Syrio Forel water dancer's stance, presenting only Syrio Forel side to the foe. "Arya child," Arya called out, never looking, never taking Arya eyes off the Lannisters, "we are done with dancing for the day.   Arya did not want to leave Arya, but Arya had taught Arya to do as Arya said.   Arya retreated, Arya own sword stick clutched tightly in Arya hand. Watching him now, she realized that Syrio had only been toying with she when they dueled. The red cloaks came at him from three sides with steel in The red cloaks hands. They had chainmail over They chest and arms, and steel codpieces sewn into They pants, but only leather on They legs. Their hands were bare, and the caps Their wore had noseguards, but no visor over the eyes. Syrio did not wait for them to reach Syrio, but spun to Syrio left.  He checked one sword with He stick and whirled away from a second.  Syrio put a boot to Syrio back and the red cloaks went down together.  Syrio ducked under Syrio blade and thrust upward. The guardsman fell screaming as blood welled from the wet red hole where The guardsman left eye had been.   The dagger man stabbed at The dagger man. Syrio caught the thrust in the helmet and shattered the man's kneecap with the man stick.  Syrio rolled right, and the butcher's cut caught the helmetless man between neck and shoulder as the helmetless man between neck and shoulder struggled to the helmetless man between neck and shoulder knees.   Before his killer could wrench free his blade, Syrio jabbed his in the apple of his throat. The guardsman gave a choked cry and staggered back, clutching at The guardsman neck, The guardsman face blackening.   "Bloody oafs," he swore, drawing he longsword from his longsword scabbard. Syrio Forel resumed Syrio Forel stance and clicked Syrio Forel teeth together. "Arya child," Arya called out, never looking at Arya child, "be gone now."  She saw: the knight in his pale armor head to foot, legs, throat, and hands sheathed in metal, eyes hidden behind his high white helm, and in his hand cruel steel.   "The first sword of Braavos does not run," The first sword of Braavos sang as Ser Meryn slashed at The first sword of Braavos. Syrio danced away from Syrio cut, Syrio stick a blur. In a heartbeat, a heartbeat had bounced blows off the knight's temple, elbow, and throat, the wood ringing against the metal of helm, gauntlet, and gorget.       A baker's helper stepped in front of A baker, holding a wooden tray. Arya bowled Arya over, scattering fragrant loaves of fresh-baked bread on the floor. She heard shouting behind She as She spun around a portly butcher who stood gaping at She with a cleaver in his hands.  All that Syrio Forel had taught her went racing through her head.              The grip of her wooden sword was slick with sweat, and Arya was breathing hard when her reached the turret stair. For an instant an instant froze.  Up would take her to the covered bridge that spanned the small court to the Tower of the Hand, but that would be the way they'd expect her to go, for certain.       She dare not go back up those steps, but She couldn't stay here, either. She had to find She father and tell her father what had happened. Her father would protect Her. Arya thrust Arya wooden sword through Arya belt and began to climb, leaping from cask to cask until Arya could reach the window. Grasping the stone with both hands, the stone with both hands pulled the stone with both hands up.   When her head reached ground level, her peered across the bailey to the Tower of the Hand.  A dead man sprawled facedown on the steps, A dead man cloak tangled beneath A dead man, the back of A dead man mailed shirt soaked red. The corpse's cloak was grey wool trimmed with white satin, The corpse's cloak saw with sudden terror.      She remembered what the man with the yellow beard had said, the day She had found the monsters.  Arya felt tears in Arya eyes. She held She breath to listen.      Arya closed Arya eyes.   They could kill her father too, and her if They caught her. "Fear cuts deeper than swords, " she said aloud, but it was no good pretending to be a water dancer, Syrio had been a water dancer and the white knight had probably killed Syrio, and anyhow she was only a little girl with a wooden stick, alone and afraid. She squirmed out into the yard, glancing around warily as She climbed to She feet.   All the people must be hiding inside, All the people doors barred. Arya glanced up longingly at Arya bedchamber, then moved away from the Tower of the Hand, keeping close to the wall as Arya slid from shadow to shadow. She pretended She was chasing cats .   except she was the cat now, and if they caught she, they would kill she. Moving between buildings and over walls, keeping stone to stone back wherever possible so no one could surprise stone, Arya reached the stables almost without incident. A dozen gold cloaks in mail and plate ran past as she was edging across the inner bailey, but without knowing whose side A dozen gold cloaks in mail and plate were on, she hunched down low in the shadows and let A dozen gold cloaks in mail and plate pass.  He had been stabbed so many times so many times looked as if He tunic was patterned with scarlet flowers. Arya was certain Arya was dead, but when Arya crept closer, Arya eyes opened.            The master of horse closed The master of horse eyes again and said no more. Inside were more bodies; a groom she had played with, and three of she father's household guard.  The dead men must have been loading it for the trip to the docks when The dead men were attacked.  One of the corpses was Desmond, who'd shown her his longsword and promised to protect her father. He lay on He back, staring blindly at the ceiling as flies crawled across He eyes.   Every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords, Desmond had told Every northerner.   The animals were restless in The animals stalls, whickering and snorting at the scent of blood.  All she had to do was stay on the kingsroad and the kingsroad would take she back to Winterfell.  As she crossed in back of the wagon, a fallen chest caught she eye. It must have been knocked down in  the fight or dropped as It was being loaded.  Arya recognized silks and satins and velvets Arya never wore.        She found a heavy woolen cloak, a velvet skirt and a silk tunic and some smallclothes, a dress She mother had embroidered for She, a silver baby bracelet She might sell.  She had hidden it way down at the bottom, under everything, but She stuff had all been jumbled around when the chest was dropped. For a moment Arya was afraid someone had found the sword and stolen the sword.  "There she is," a voice hissed close behind she.  A stableboy stood behind A stableboy, a smirk on A stableboy face, A stableboy filthy white undertunic peeking out from beneath a soiled jerkin. His boots were covered with manure, and His had a pitchfork in one hand.   "She don't know me," he said, "but I knows She, oh, yes.   "My father's the Hand of the King, My father'll reward you."         Everything Syrio Forel had ever taught Syrio Forel vanished in a heartbeat. In that instant of sudden terror, the only lesson Arya could remember was the one Jon Snow had given Arya, the very first.  Needle went through Needle leather jerkin and the white flesh of Needle belly and came out between Needle shoulder blades.   "Oh, gods," he moaned, as he undertunic began to redden.     Blood had gushed from the boy's mouth as the boy collapsed, and more was seeping from the slit in the boy belly, pooling beneath the boy body. His palms were cut where His'd grabbed at the blade. She backed away slowly, Needle red in She hand.  She snatched up the bridle and harness again and ran to She mare, but as She lifted the saddle to the  horse's back, Arya realized with a sudden sick dread that the castle gates would be closed.  Maybe the guards wouldn't recognize the guards. If they thought she was a boy, perhaps they'd let she .   no, they'd have orders not to let anyone out, it wouldn't matter whether they knew her or not.      She wasn't certain, yet She knew She had to try. She found the clothing She'd gathered and slipped into the cloak, concealing Needle beneath Needle folds. The rest of her things her tied in a roll. With the bundle under her arm, her crept to the far end of the stable. Unlatching the back door, the back door peeked out anxiously.  She would need to go down the serpentine steps, past the small kitchen and the pig yard, that was how She'd gone last time, chasing the black tomcat .      If she crossed to the other side of the castle, she could creep along the river wall and through the little godswood .       What would they do if they saw her running across the yard? She'd look so small from up there, would they be able to tell who She was?  She had to leave now, She told She, but when the moment came, She was too frightened to move.  Arya was so startled Arya almost dropped Arya bundle. She looked around wildly, but there was no one in the stable but She, and the horses, and the dead men.   She could not tell, yet somehow it calmed She fears.   She wanted to run and hide, but She made She walk across the yard, slowly, putting one foot in front of the other as if She had all the time in the world and no reason to be afraid of anyone. She thought She could feel their eyes, like bugs crawling on She skin under She clothes.  If she saw them watching, all she courage would desert she, she knew, and she would drop the bundle of clothes and run and cry like a baby, and then them would have she. She kept She gaze on the ground.     She stuffed them up She sleeves, and left by a back window. Sneaking back to the alley where she had cornered the one-eared tom was easy, but after that she got lost. She crawled in and out of windows, hopped over walls, and felt She way through dark cellars, quiet  as a shadow.   She tossed She bundle through and doubled back to light She candle. That was chancy; the fire she'd remembered seeing had burnt down to embers, and she heard voices as she was blowing on the coals. Cupping her fingers around the flickering candle, her went out the window as they were coming in the door, without ever getting a glimpse of who the window was.   Arya held the candle over Arya head. With each step she took, the shadows moved against the walls, as if the shadows were turning to watch she pass.  She slid Needle out from under She cloak. The slender blade seemed very small and the dragons very big, yet somehow Arya felt better with steel in Arya hand.  She held Needle in She left hand, She sword hand, the candle in She right fist.   Part of her wanted to run, but her was afraid of snuffing out her candle. She heard the faint squeaking of rats and glimpsed a pair of tiny glowing eyes on the edge of the light, but rats did not scare She.   She could almost see the stableboy standing against the wall, stableboy hands curled into claws with the blood still dripping from the deep gashes in stableboy palms where Needle had cut stableboy. He might be waiting to grab her as her passed.       They were a lot scarier than this place, she told she. She'd been just a little girl the first time She saw them. Her brother Robb had taken Her brother Robb down, Her and Sansa and baby Bran, who'd been no bigger than Rickon was now. They'd only had one candle between They, and Bran's eyes had gotten as big as saucers as he stared at the stone faces of the Kings of Winter, with They wolves at They feet and They iron swords across They laps. Robb took them all the way down to the end, past Grandfather and Brandon and Lyanna, to show Grandfather and Brandon and Lyanna Grandfather and Brandon and Lyanna own tombs. Sansa kept looking at the stubby little candle, anxious that Sansa might go out. Old Nan had told Old Nan there were spiders down here, and rats as big as dogs.      When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrieking for the stairs, and Bran wrapped Bran around Robb's leg, sobbing. Arya stood Arya ground and gave the spirit a punch.   The memory made Arya smile, and after that the darkness held no more terrors for Arya. The stableboy was dead, The stableboy'd killed The stableboy, and if The stableboy jumped out at The stableboy The stableboy'd kill The stableboy again.   Her footsteps sent soft echoes hurrying ahead of Her as Arya plunged deeper into the darkness.   Her fingers felt thick and clumsy as Her struggled with the silver fastenings without the benefit of servants. Jeyne Poole had been confined with Jeyne Poole, but Jeyne was useless. Her face was puffy from all Her crying, and Her could not seem to stop sobbing about Her father. "I'm certain your father is well," Sansa told your father when your father had finally gotten the dress buttoned right. "I'll ask the queen to let you see the queen." She thought that kindness might lift Jeyne's spirits, but the other girl just looked at the other girl with red, swollen eyes and began to cry all the harder.    She had grown up to the sound of steel in the yard, and scarcely a day of She life had passed without hearing the clash of sword on sword, yet somehow knowing that the fighting was real made all the difference in the world. She heard it as She had never heard it before, and there were other sounds as well, grunts of pain, angry curses, shouts for help, and the moans of wounded and dying men.  So she wept, pleading through she door for them to tell she what was happening, calling for she father, for Septa Mordane, for the king, for she gallant prince. If the men guarding her heard her pleas, the men guarding her gave no answer.  "They're killing everyone, " the steward's daughter had shrieked at the steward's daughter.  The Hound had broken down The Hound door with a warhammer, The Hound said.  Sansa dried Sansa own tears as Sansa struggled to comfort Sansa friend.    From its window, she could see that the heavy iron portcullis in the gatehouse was down, and the drawbridge drawn up over the deep dry moat that separated the keep-within-a-keep from the larger castle that surrounded the heavy iron portcullis in the gatehouse.    They were fed-hard cheese and fresh-baked bread and milk to break They fast, roast chicken and greens at midday, and a late supper of beef and barley stew-but the servants who brought the meals would not answer Sansa's questions. That evening, some women brought her clothes from the Tower of the Hand, and some of Jeyne's things as well, but some women seemed nearly as frightened as Jeyne, and when her tried to talk to some women, some women fled from her as if her had the grey plague. The guards outside the door still refused to let The guards outside the door leave the room. "Please, I need to speak to the queen again," Sansa told them, as the queen told everyone the queen saw that day. "She'll want to talk to me, I know She will. Tell her I want to see her, please.  We're to marry when We're older."   The ringing went on and on, and after a while The ringing heard other bells answering from the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya's Hill.   Jeyne asked, covering Jeyne ears.   Sansa could not say how Sansa knew Sansa, yet Sansa did.       She was afraid for him, and for She father.    That night Sansa dreamt of Joffrey on the throne, with Sansa seated beside Joffrey in a gown of woven gold. She had a crown on She head, and everyone She had ever known came before She, to bend the knee and say everyone she had ever known courtesies. The next morning, the morning of the third day, Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard came to escort Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard to the queen.  His nose was flat, His cheeks baggy with jowls, His hair grey and brittle. Today Today wore white velvet, and Today snowy cloak was fastened with a lion brooch. The beast had the soft sheen of gold, and The beast eyes were tiny rubies. "You look very handsome and splendid this morning, Ser Boros," Sansa told Ser Boros. A lady remembered A lady courtesies, and A lady was resolved to be a lady no matter what.     Sansa made Sansa smile at them pleasantly and bid them a good morning as Sansa passed. It was the first time she had been allowed outside the chamber since Ser Arys Oakheart had led she there two mornings past. "To keep you safe, my sweet one," Queen Cersei had told Queen Cersei. "Joffrey would never forgive me if anything happened to Joffrey precious." Sansa had expected that Ser Boros would escort Sansa to the royal apartments, but instead Ser Boros led Sansa out of Maegor's Holdfast.   When Sansa peered down, Sansa saw a body impaled on the huge iron spikes below. She averted She eyes quickly, afraid to ask, afraid to look too long, afraid he might be someone She knew.     Sansa had hoped Joffrey might be with Sansa.  Lord Petyr Baelish sat on the queen's left hand, Grand Maester Pycelle at the end of the table, while Lord Petyr Baelish hovered over them, smelling flowery.     The queen wore a high-collared black silk gown, with a hundred dark red rubies sewn into The queen bodice, covering The queen from neck to bosom.  Cersei smiled to see Cersei, and Sansa thought it was the sweetest and saddest smile Cersei had ever seen. "Sansa, my sweet child," she said, "I know you've been asking for she.     "Only, well, no one will talk to us or tell us what's happened "us?"  "We put the steward's girl in with the steward's girl," Ser Boros said.   "Next time, you will ask," she said, she voice sharp.    I promised her I'd ask if her could see her father." Old Grand Maester Pycelle lowered Old Grand Maester Pycelle eyes. "Her father is well, isn't Her father?"            "Ser Boros, escort this girl to Lord Petyr's apartments and instruct Lord Petyr people to keep this girl there until Lord Petyr comes for this girl. Tell her that Littlefinger will be taking her to see her father, that ought to calm her down. I want her gone before Sansa returns to her chamber."  He bowed deeply, spun on He heel, and took He leave, He long white cloak stirring the air behind He.    Why can't Ser Boros take Ser Boros to Ser Boros instead of Lord Petyr having to do it?" She had promised She She would be a lady, gentle as the queen and as strong as She mother, the Lady Catelyn, but all of a sudden She was scared again. For a second she thought she might cry.  She hasn't done anything wrong, She's a good girl."     She patted the chair beside She.   Sansa seated Sansa beside the queen. Cersei smiled again, but that did not make Cersei feel any less anxious. Varys was wringing Varys soft hands together, Grand Maester Pycelle kept Varys sleepy eyes on the papers in front of Varys, but Varys could feel Littlefinger staring. Something about the way the small man looked at her made Sansa feel as though her had no clothes on.  "Sweet Sansa," Queen Cersei said, laying a soft hand on Queen Cersei wrist.      Her prince loved Her.     She gave a weary shake of She head.      Grand Maester Pycelle lifted Grand Maester Pycelle ancient head. "With my own ears, I heard Lord Eddard swear to our beloved King Robert that our beloved King Robert would protect the young princes as if the young princes were our beloved King Robert own sons. And yet the moment the king was dead, the king called the small council together to steal Prince Joffrey's rightful throne."       It is a letter to my late husband's brother Stannis, inviting my late husband's brother Stannis to take the crown."   "Please, send for my father, my father'll tell you, my father would never write such a letter, the king was my father friend."  "This betrayal would have broken This betrayal heart.          She had to wed Joffrey, they were betrothed, Joffrey was promised to She, She had even dreamed about it. It wasn't fair to take him away from her on account of whatever her father might have done. "How well I know that, child," Cersei said, Cersei voice so kind and sweet.    She was the good girl, the obedient girl, but She had felt as wicked as Arya that morning, sneaking away from Septa Mordane, defying She lord father. She had never done anything so willful before, and She would never have done it then if She hadn't loved Joffrey as much as She did.  I told him, but him wouldn't listen." The king had been The king last hope. The king could command Father to let The king stay in King's Landing and marry Prince Joffrey, Sansa knew The king could, but The king had always frightened The king. He was loud and rough-voiced and drunk as often as not, and He would probably have just sent her back to Lord Eddard, if they even let her see He. So she went to the queen instead, and poured out she heart, and Cersei had listened and thanked she sweetly .   only then Ser Arys had escorted Ser Arys to the high room in Maegor's Holdfast and posted guards, and a few hours later, the fighting had begun outside. "Please," she finished, "you have to let me marry Joffrey, I'll be ever so good a wife to Joffrey, you'll see.   "My lords of the council, what do you say to My lords of the council plea?"  "A love so true and innocent, Your Grace, it would be cruel to deny it .      "A child born of traitor's seed will find that betrayal comes naturally to A child born of traitor's seed," said Grand Maester Pycelle. "She is a sweet thing now, but in ten years, who can say what treasons She may hatch?"     I wouldn't betray Joffrey, I love Joffrey, I swear it, I do."       The queen looked at The queen, troubled, and yet Sansa could see kindness in The queen clear green eyes. "Child," Child said, "if I could truly believe that you were not like your father, why nothing should please me more than to see you wed to my Joffrey. I know he loves you with all he heart."    I have only to remember how your sister set your sister wolf on my son."    She felt the weight of Cersei's eyes as the queen studied She face.   "My lords, it seems to me that if the rest of My lords kin were to remain loyal in this terrible time, that would go a long way toward laying our fears to rest." Grand Maester Pycelle stroked Grand Maester Pycelle huge soft beard, Grand Maester Pycelle wide brow furrowed in thought.    The queen took Sansa's hand in both of The queen.   She could read and write better than any of She brothers, although She was hopeless at sums.           "The word of your lord father's treason will no doubt reach The word of your lord father's treason soon.  You must tell them how Lord Eddard betrayed Lord Eddard king." Sansa wanted Joffrey desperately, but Sansa did not think Sansa had the courage to do as the queen was asking.          The queen patted The queen hand.   "It will go hard for them if them don't," said Grand Maester Pycelle. "By the love you bear them, you must urge them to walk the path of wisdom."  "You must tell her that you are well and in our care, that our are treating you gently and seeing to your every want. Bid them to come to King's Landing and pledge them fealty to Joffrey when Joffrey takes Joffrey throne.               if I might see my father, talk to my father about .       If you are truly as loyal as you say, why should you want to see you are truly as loyal as you say?"    I only meant Sansa felt Sansa eyes grow wet.                    Sansa blinked back Sansa tears. Joffrey was the king now, Joffrey thought. Her gallant prince would never hurt Her father, no matter what Her gallant prince might have done. If she went to him and pleaded for mercy, she was certain him'd listen. He had to listen, He loved her, even the queen said so. Joff would need to punish Father, the lords would expect Joff, but perhaps Joff could send the lords back to Winterfell, or exile the lords to one of the Free Cities across the narrow sea.   Once she was queen, she could persuade Joff to bring Father back and grant Joff a pardon.  Her Joffrey was good and kind, Her knew it in Her heart, but a king had to be stern with rebels. She had to make them understand, She had to!  I'll write the letters," Sansa told the letters.   Joffrey will be so proud when I tell Joffrey what courage and good sense you've shown here today."  To her mother, the Lady Catelyn Stark, and to her brothers at Winterfell, and to her aunt and her grandfather as well, Lady Lysa Arryn of the Eyrie, and Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun. By the time she had done, she fingers were cramped and stiff and stained with ink. Varys had Varys father's seal. She warmed the pale white beeswax over a candle, poured the pale white beeswax carefully, and watched as the eunuch stamped each letter with the direwolf of House Stark. Jeyne Poole and all Jeyne Poole things were gone when Ser Mandon Moore returned Sansa to the high tower of Maegor's Holdfast.  Yet somehow it seemed colder with Jeyne gone, even after Jeyne'd built a fire. She pulled a chair close to the hearth, took down one of She favorite books, and lost She in the stories of Florian and Jonquil, of Lady Shella and the Rainbow Knight, of valiant Prince Aemon and Prince Aemon doomed love for Prince Aemon brother's queen. It was not until later that night, as she was drifting off to sleep, that Sansa realized she had forgotten to ask about she sister.   He turned  the corpse over with He foot, and the dead white face stared up at the overcast sky with blue, blue eyes. "They were Ben Stark's men, both of They."  He remembered how He'd pleaded to ride with them.       His left hand, still at the end of His arm, was as black as His cloak.  He swung down from He garron, handing He reins to Jon.  His horse was nervous, rolling His horse eyes, backing away from the dead men as far as His horse lead would allow. Jon led her off a few paces, fighting to keep her from bolting.     When Bass the kennelmaster had tried to get Bass to take the scent from the severed hand, Bass had gone wild, yowling and barking, fighting to get away. Even now they were snarling and whimpering by turns, pulling at they leashes while Chett cursed they for curs. It is only a wood, Jon told Jon, and they're only dead men.     He was wandering the empty castle, searching for He father, descending into the crypts.   When he turned he saw that the vaults were opening, one after the other. As the dead kings came stumbling from the dead kings cold black graves, Jon had woken in pitchdark, Jon heart hammering. Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at Ghost face, Ghost could not shake Ghost deep sense of terror.  Instead he had climbed the Wall and walked, restless, until he saw the light of the dawn off to the cast.     So far he had not lurched off to the woods to retch, but he had not so much as glanced at the dead men either.  "You have to look," Jon told Jon, keeping Jon voice low so the others would not hear. "Maester Aemon sent you to be Maester Aemon eyes, didn't Maester Aemon?       "We have a dozen rangers with We, and the dogs, even Ghost.    Sam gave a tremulous nod, working up Sam courage with a visible effort. Slowly he swiveled he head. His eyes widened, but Jon held His arm so His could not turn away. "Ser Jaremy," the Old Bear asked gruffly, "Ben Stark had six men with Ben Stark when Ben Stark rode from the Wall.  Ser Jaremy shook Ser Jaremy head.   "Two of our brothers butchered almost within sight of the Wall, yet your rangers heard nothing, saw nothing.        Ser Jaremy bristled, Ser Jaremy face taut with anger. "No horn was blown, my lord, or my rangers would have heard No horn.    and since Benjen was lost, we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were wont to do before, by your own command."       Squatting beside the dead man he had named Jafer Flowers, Ser Jaremy grasped Ser Jaremy head by the scalp. The hair came out between The hair fingers, brittle as straw. The knight cursed and shoved at the face with the heel of The knight hand.      Jon could feel Jon breakfast churning in Jon belly, but Jon pressed Jon lips together and made Jon look at the second body. Othor had been a big ugly man, and Othor made a big ugly corpse.  Jon remembered Othor; Jon had been the one bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers rode out.  His flesh was blanched white as milk, everywhere but His hands.           Jon could have told Jon. He knew, they all knew, yet no man of they would say the words.  If they ever lived at all, they are gone eight thousand years. Even the thought made him feel foolish; him was a man grown now, a black brother of the Night's Watch, not the boy who'd once sat at Old Nan's feet with Bran and Robb and Arya.  "If Ben Stark had come under wildling attack a half day's ride from Castle Black, Ben Stark would have returned for more men, chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back the killers heads."   It had been so long, It seemed folly to cling to the hope that Ben Stark was still alive, but Jon Snow was nothing if not stubborn.   The wildlings might have fallen on The wildlings anywhere. I'd wager these two were the last survivors of his party, on the last survivors of his party way back to us .   but the enemy caught them before them could reach the safety of the Wall. The corpses are still fresh, The corpses cannot have been dead more than a day "No, " Samwell Tarly squeaked.  Sam's nervous, high-pitched voice was the last Sam would have expected to hear. The fat boy was frightened of the officers, and Ser Jaremy was not known for The fat boy patience.    "If the lad has something to say, I'll hear the lad out.                   "He soils He smallclothes at the sight of his smallclothes," Chett shouted out, and the rangers laughed. Sam mopped at the sweat on Sam brow.                    L-lord Randyll, L-lord Randyll, L-lord Randyll made me watch L-lord Randyll dress animals sometimes, when .      Sam shook Sam head from side to side, Sam chins quivering. Now that he had looked at the bodies, he could not seem to look away.                 He looked as though He was going to be sick.                    "If they'd been dead much longer than a day, they'd be ripe by now, boy.  Dywen, the gnarled old forester who liked to boast that Dywen could  smell snow coming on, sidled closer to the corpses and took a whiff.       Sam pointed, Sam fat finger shaking only a little.             they've been lying here in the woods, but they .                 The dogs and the horses won't go near The dogs and the horses." The rangers exchanged glances; The rangers could see it was true, every man of The rangers.   Chett tried, cursing, yanking on the leashes, giving one animal a lick of Chett boot. Most of the dogs just whimpered and planted the dogs feet.  The bitch resisted, growling and squirming as if to escape The bitch collar.   The dog leapt over The dog and bounded off into the trees.                           Sam made Sam swallow, took a deep breath.         Dywen sucked at Dywen wooden teeth.       "Neither did Flowers," Flowers blurted, turning to stare at the dead man.  For a moment all they heard was Sam's heavy breathing and the wet sound of Dywen sucking on Sam teeth.     The Old Bear gave a stubborn shake of The Old Bear head.     They wrapped the dead men in cloaks, but when Hake and Dywen tried to tie one onto a horse, the animal went mad, screaming and rearing, lashing out with the animal hooves, even biting at Ketter when Ketter ran to help.    "I will have these woods searched," Mormont commanded Ser Jaremy as these woods set out.   If Ben and the others are out here, dead or alive, I will have Ben and the others are out here, dead or alive found. And if there is anyone else in these woods, I will know of there is anyone else in these woods. You are to track them and take them, alive if possible.     Jon followed close behind Jon; as the Lord Commander's steward, that was Jon place.  No wind stirred the wood; the air hung humid and heavy, and Jon's clothes clung to Jon skin.   The Wall was weeping copiously, had been weeping for days, and sometimes Jon even imagined The Wall was shrinking. The old men called this weather spirit summer, and said this weather spirit meant the season was giving up this weather spirit ghosts at last.   Jon had been a babe in arms when a babe in arms began.   He found He glancing at every shadow with unease. Unbidden, he thought back on the tales that Old Nan used to tell them, when he was a boy at Winterfell. He could almost hear her voice again, and the click-click-click of her needles. In that darkness, the Others came riding, she used to say, dropping she voice lower and lower. Cold and dead they were, and they hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every living creature with hot blood in living veins. Holdfasts and cities and kingdoms of men allfell before Holdfasts and cities and kingdoms of men, as Holdfasts and cities and kingdoms of men moved south on pale dead horses, leading hosts of the slain. They fed They dead servants on the flesh of human children .   When he caught he first glimpse of the Wall looming above the tops of an ancient gnarled oak, Jon was vastly relieved. Mormont reined up suddenly and turned in Mormont saddle.  Jon saw the start of fright on Sam's face as Jon lumbered up on Jon mare; doubtless Jon thought Jon was in trouble.    Sam blushed a vivid crimson and tripped over Sam own tongue as Sam tried to stammer out a courtesy.  When they emerged from under the trees, Mormont spurred Mormont tough little garron to a trot. Ghost came streaking out from the woods to meet Ghost, licking Ghost chops, Ghost muzzle red from prey.       Bowen Marsh was waiting at the first gate as Bowen Marsh led Bowen Marsh garrons through the icy tunnel.  "My lord," My lord blurted at Mormont as My lord swung open the iron bars, "there's been a bird, you must come at once."   Curiously, Marsh glanced at Jon before Jon answered.    Jon, see to my horse, and tell Ser Jaremy to put the dead men in a storeroom until the maester is ready for the dead men."  As they led they horses back to the stable, Jon was uncomfortably aware that people were watching Jon. Ser Alliser Thorne was drilling Ser Alliser Thorne boys in the yard, but Ser Alliser Thorne broke off to stare at Jon, a faint half smile on Ser Alliser Thorne lips.      Jon saw that Mormont's horse was fed and watered and groomed before Jon took care of Jon own. Afterward he sought out he friends. Grenn and Toad were on watch, but Grenn found Pyp in the common hall.   Pyp lowered Pyp voice.   Robert Baratheon had looked old and fat when Robert Baratheon visited Winterfell, yet Robert Baratheon'd seemed hale enough, and there'd been no talk of illness.     He was your father's friend, wasn't He?"  Jon wondered if Joffrey would keep Jon father as the King's Hand.  That might mean Lord Eddard would return to Winterfell, and Lord Eddard sisters as well.  It would be good to see Arya's grin again and to talk with Arya father. I will ask him about my mother, him resolved. I am a man now, it is past time a man told me.    "Two of the six he took with he.            The brothers on guard eyed him solemnly as him approached. "The Old Bear's in his solar," one of The Old Bear's in his solar announced.     He wants wine or a fire in He hearth, that's all, He told He. When he entered the solar, Mormont's raven screamed at he.          Mormont lifted Mormont eyes from the letter to stare at Jon. There was pity in that look; pity could taste it.  Jon poured with exaggerated care, vaguely aware that Jon was drawing out the act.  Yet all too soon, all were filled.    "It's my father, isn't It?"  "Your father and the king," the king rumbled.     The things we love destroy we every time, lad.  My son loved that young wife of My son.  If not for her, not for her would never have thought to sell those poachers." Jon could scarcely follow what Jon was saying.                  Lord Eddard Stark would never dishonor Lord Eddard Stark .    He fathered a bastard, a small voice whispered inside He.    "My lord, what will happen to My lord?        Whatever your father has done, or hasn't done, your father is a great lord.   Jon knew that other men accused of treason had been allowed to redeem other men accused of treason honor on the Wall in days past.    It would be a monstrous injustice to strip him of Winterfell and force him to take the black, and yet if it meant him life .    He remembered the prince at Winterfell, the way He'd mocked Robb and Ser Rodrik in the yard. Jon himself Jon had scarcely even noticed; bastards were beneath even Jon contempt.      I imagine he'll listen to he mother. A pity the dwarf isn't with the dwarf. He's the lad's uncle, and He saw our need when He visited our. It was a bad thing, your lady mother taking him captive-" "Lady Stark is not your lady mother," Jon reminded him sharply. Tyrion Lannister had been a friend to Tyrion Lannister. If Lord Eddard was killed, Lord Eddard would be as much to blame as the queen.  Arya and Sansa, Arya and Sansa were with my father, do you know-" "Pycelle makes no mention of Arya and Sansa, but doubtless Arya and Sansa'll be treated gently.  Mormont shook Mormont head.          He's myfather, Jon wanted to say, but He knew that Mormont would not want to hear Mormont.  He made He take another sip of wine. "Your duty is here now," the Lord Commander reminded Your duty.      When Jon did not answer, the old man finished Jon wine and said, "You're free to go.    The next he knew, he was descending the tower steps, thinking, This is my father, my sisters, how can the tower steps be none of my concern?    "My father is no traitor," My father said hoarsely. Even the words stuck in his throat, as if to choke his. The wind was rising, and The wind seemed colder in the yard than The wind had when he'd gone in.   Jon could not have said where Jon walked, what Jon did, who Jon spoke with. Ghost was with Ghost, Ghost knew that much.   Their wolves might have kept Their safe, but Lady is dead and Nymeria's lost, Their're all alone.  Jon could hear it skirling against the Wall and over the icy battlements as Jon went to the common hall for the evening meal.  When he spooned an extra portion onto Jon's plate and gave he the crusty heel of the bread, he knew what the crusty heel of the bread meant.    His friends rallied to His. "We asked the septon to light a candle for your father," Matthar told your father. "It's a lie, we all know It's a lie, even Grenn knows It's a lie," Pyp chimed in. Grenn nodded, and Sam clasped Jon's hand, "You're my brother now, so Grenn's my father too," the fat boy said. "If you want to go out to the weirwoods and pray to the old gods, I'll go with the old gods." The weirwoods were beyond the Wall, yet The weirwoods knew Sam meant what The weirwoods said.      "Not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard," he was telling the men around he. In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in Jon hand. Pyp made a grab for Pyp, but Pyp wrenched Pyp leg away, and then Pyp was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser's hand.   People were shouting, but Jon Snow did not hear People. He lunged at Ser Alliser's face with the dagger, slashing at those cold onyx eyes, but Sam threw Sam between them and before Jon could get around Sam, Pyp was on Sam back clinging like a monkey, and Grenn was grabbing Sam arm while Toad wrenched the knife from Sam fingers. Later, much later, after they had marched him back to him sleeping cell, Mormont came down to see him, raven on him shoulder.   Mormont shook Mormont head, disgusted.  They took his knife and his sword and told his his was not to leave his cell until the high officers met to decide what was to be done with his. And then they placed a guard outside his door to make certain his obeyed. His friends were not allowed to see His, but the Old Bear did relent and permit His Ghost, so His was not utterly alone. "My father is no traitor," My father told the direwolf when the rest had gone. Ghost looked at Ghost in silence. Jon slumped against the wall, hands around Jon knees, and stared at the candle on the table beside Jon narrow bed.    When he woke, he legs were stiff and cramped and the candle had long since  burned out. Ghost stood on Ghost hind legs, scrabbling at the door. Jon was startled to see how tall Jon'd grown.   The direwolf turned his head and looked down at his, baring his fangs in a silent snarl.        Jon watched Jon with mounting disquiet.    The guard, The guard thought, The guard left a man to guard my door, Ghost smells a man through my door, that's all it is. Slowly, Jon pushed Jon to Jon feet. He was shivering uncontrollably, wishing He still had a sword.  He grabbed the handle and pulled the handle inward.  His guard was sprawled bonelessly across the narrow steps, looking up at His. Looking up at him, even though him was lying on him stomach.  It can't be, Jon told Jon. This is the Lord Commander's Tower, the Lord Commander's Tower's guarded day and night, this couldn't happen, it's a dream, I'm having a nightmare. Ghost slid past Ghost, out the door.      The guard's sword was in The guard's sword sheath.  The heft of steel in his fist made his bolder. He moved up the steps, Ghost padding silently before He.  Jon crept up warily, probing any suspicious darkness with the point of Jon sword.       Jon stopped in the doorway, blade in hand, giving Jon eyes a moment to adjust.       but beneath the hood, the hood eyes shone with an icy blue radiance .       Keeping the wall to his back, his slid toward the window and ripped down the curtain.  He glimpsed black hands buried in white fur, swollen dark fingers tightening around He direwolf's throat. Ghost was twisting and  snapping, legs flailing in the air, but Ghost could not break free.  He threw He forward, shouting, bringing down the longsword with all He weight behind the longsword.  The smell that engulfed him was so queer and cold him almost gagged.  Ghost wrenched free of the other hand and crept away, red tongue lolling from Ghost mouth. The hooded man lifted The hooded man pale moon face, and Jon slashed at it without hesitation. The sword laid the intruder open to the bone, taking off half The sword nose and opening a gash cheek to cheek under those eyes, eyes, eyes like blue stars burning.  Othor, Othor thought, reeling back. Gods, he's dead, he's dead, I saw he dead. He felt something scrabble at He ankle. Black fingers clawed at Black fingers calf. The arm was crawling up The arm leg, ripping at wool and flesh. Shouting with revulsion, Jon pried the fingers off Jon leg with the point of Jon sword and flipped the thing away.     Jon held the longsword before Jon.  he commanded, he voice gone shrill.  The severed arm was wriggling out of The severed arm torn sleeve, a pale snake with a black five-fingered head. Ghost pounced and got it between Ghost teeth.   Dead Othor slammed into Dead Othor, knocking Dead Othor off Dead Othor feet. Jon's breath went out of Jon as the fallen table caught Jon between Jon shoulder blades.   When he opened he mouth to scream, the wight jammed the wight black corpse fingers into his mouth.  Its hand forced Its farther down Its hand throat, icy cold, choking Its hand.  Frost covered Frost eyes, sparkling blue. Jon raked cold flesh with Jon nails and kicked at the thing's legs.    And suddenly the corpse's weight was gone, the corpse's weight fingers ripped from his throat.   He watched as the direwolf buried He teeth in the wight's gut and began to rip and tear. He watched, only half conscious, for a long moment before He finally remembered to look for He sword .     Jon tried to shout, but Jon voice was gone. Staggering to his feet, his kicked the arm away and snatched the lamp from the Old Bear's fingers.     Spinning, Jon saw the drapes Jon'd ripped from the window.      The direwolf wrenched free and came to him as the wight struggled to rise, dark snakes spilling from the great wound in the wight belly. Jon plunged Jon hand into the flames, grabbed a fistful of the burning drapes, and whipped a fistful of the burning drapes at Jon. Let it bum, he prayed as the cloth smothered the corpse, gods, please, please, let it bum. Chapter The Karstarks came in on a cold windy morning, bringing three hundred horsemen and near two thousand foot from three hundred horsemen castle at Karhold.  A man went before them, pounding out a slow, deep-throated marching rhythm on a drum that was bigger than A man was, boom, boom, boom. Bran watched Bran come from a guard turret atop the outer wall, peering through Maester Luwin's bronze far-eye while perched on Hodor's shoulders. Lord Rickard himself led them, Lord Rickard himself sons Harrion and Eddard and Torrhen riding beside Lord Rickard himself beneath night-black banners emblazoned with the white sunburst of them House. Old Nan said they had Stark blood in they, going back hundreds of years, but they did not look like Starks to Bran.    The other lords were already here, with The other lords hosts.  But Robb had forbidden Robb to leave the castle.       He was using the voice of Robb the Lord when He said the voice of Robb the Lord; Bran knew that meant there was no appeal.   He had been as helpless as a baby, no more able to defend He than Rickon would have been.      He was only a few years younger than Robb; if He brother was almost a man grown, so was He. He should have been able to protect He. A year ago, before, he would have visited the town even if the town meant climbing over the walls by he. In those days he could run down stairs, get on and off he pony by he, and wield a wooden sword good enough to knock Prince Tommen in the dirt.     Bran was always given the place of honor at Bran brother's right hand. Some of the lords bannermen gave Some of the lords bannermen queer hard stares as Some of the lords bannermen sat there, as if Some of the lords bannermen wondered by what right a green boy should be placed above Some of the lords bannermen, and a green boy a cripple too.  Bran asked Maester Luwin as Lord Karstark and Lord Karstark sons rode through the gates in the outer wall.          A man's worth is not marked by a ser before A man name.         "Robb will feast Robb tonight."       "The winter town is full to bursting, and this army of his will eat the countryside clean if The winter town camps here much longer.    Bran felt as miserable as Bran sounded.   It felt queer to look down on him this way, when him'd spent him whole life looking up at him, but when you sat on Hodor's back you looked down on everyone.   "Hodor," said Hodor. Maester Luwin tucked the tube up Maester Luwin sleeve.  He must greet Lord Karstark and He sons and make Lord Karstark and his sons welcome."   He put He hand on Hodor's shoulder.   Hodor hummed tunelessly as Hodor went down hand under hand, Bran bouncing against Hodor back in the wicker seat that Maester Luwin had fashioned for Hodor. Luwin had gotten the idea from the baskets the women used to carry firewood on the women backs; after that it had been a simple matter of cutting legholes and attaching some new straps to spread Bran's weight more evenly. It was not as good as riding Dancer, but there were places Dancer could not go, and this did not shame Bran the way Bran did when Hodor carried Bran in Bran arms like a baby. Hodor seemed to like it too, though with Hodor it was hard to tell.  Sometimes Hodor forgot that Hodor had Bran on Hodor back, and that could be painful when Hodor went through a door. For near a fortnight there had been so many comings and goings that Robb ordered both portcullises kept up and the drawbridge down between both portcullises, even in the dead of night. A long column of armored lancers was crossing the moat between the walls when Bran emerged from the tower; Karstark men, following A long column of armored lancers was crossing the moat between the walls when Bran emerged from the tower; Karstark men, following their lords into the castle lords into the castle.  Hodor trotted along beside them, smiling to Hodor, Hodor boots thudding against the wood of the drawbridge. The riders gave The riders queer looks as The riders went by, and once Bran heard someone guffaw. He refused to let it trouble He. "Men will look at you," Maester Luwin had warned Maester Luwin the first time Men had strapped the wicker basket around Hodor's chest. "They will look, and They will talk, and some will mock you."  No one mocked him in him bedchamber, but him would not live him life in bed. As they passed beneath the gatehouse portcullis, Bran put two fingers into Bran mouth and whistled.  Suddenly the Karstark lancers were fighting for control, as the Karstark lancers horses rolled the Karstark lancers eyes and whickered in dismay. One stallion reared, screaming, One stallion rider cursing and hanging on desperately. The scent of the direwolves sent horses into a frenzy of fear if horses were not accustomed to it, but horses'd quiet soon enough once Summer was gone.    The armory doors were open, and Bran glimpsed Mikken at Bran forge, Bran hammer ringing as sweat dripped off Bran bare chest. Bran had never seen as many strangers in all Bran years, not even when King Robert had come to visit Father.  They walked down a long dim hallway, Summer padding easily beside They.  Bran would have liked to touch Bran, but Bran was riding too high for Bran hand to reach.  Hodor made Hodor way through the dense stands of oak and ironwood and sentinels, to the still pool beside the heart tree.  Bran reached up over Bran head and pulled Bran out of Bran seat, drawing the dead weight of Bran legs up through the holes in the wicker basket. He hung for a moment, dangling, the dark red leaves brushing against He face, until Hodor lifted He and lowered He to the smooth stone beside the water. "I want to be by myself for a while," myself said.       Hodor hated cold water, and would fight like a treed wildcat when threatened with soap, but Hodor would happily immerse Hodor in the hottest pool and sit for hours, giving a loud burp to echo the spring whenever a bubble rose from the murky green depths to break upon the surface.   Bran had always liked the godswood, even before, but of late Bran found Bran drawn to the godswood more and more. Even the heart tree no longer scared Even the heart tree the way Even the heart tree used to. The deep red eyes carved into the pale trunk still watched him, yet somehow him took comfort from that now. The gods were looking over him, him told him; the old gods, gods of the Starks and the First Men and the children of the forest, hisfather's gods. He felt safe in their sight, and the deep silence of the trees helped He think. Bran had been thinking a lot since Bran fall; thinking, and dreaming, and talking with the gods. "Please make it so Robb won't go away," Robb prayed softly. He moved He hand through the cold water, sending ripples across the pool.  Or if he has to go, bring he home safe, with Mother and Father and the girls.     His baby brother had been wild as a winter storm since His learned Robb was riding off to war, weeping and angry by turns. He'd refused to eat, cried and screamed for most of a night, even punched Old Nan when Old Nan tried to sing Old Nan to sleep, and the next day Old Nan'd vanished. Robb had set half the castle searching for Robb, and when at last they'd found Robb down in the crypts, Rickon had slashed at they with a rusted iron sword Rickon'd snatched from a dead king's hand, and Shaggydog had come slavering out of the darkness like a green-eyed demon. The wolf was near as wild as Rickon; The wolf'd bitten Gage on the arm and torn a chunk of flesh from Mikken's thigh. It had taken Robb himself and Grey Wind to bring Robb to bay. Farlen had the black wolf chained up in the kennels now, and Rickon cried all the more for being without the black wolf. Maester Luwin counseled Robb to remain at Winterfell, and Bran pleaded with Robb too, for Bran own sake as much as Rickon's, but Bran brother only shook his brother head stubbornly and said, "I don't want to go.   Someone had to go, to hold the Neck and help the Tullys against the Lannisters, Bran could understand that, but Bran did not have to be Robb. His brother might have given the command to Hal Mollen or Theon Greyjoy, or to one of His lords bannermen. Maester Luwin urged Maester Luwin to do just that, but Robb would not hear of it. "My lord father would never have sent men off to die while My lord father huddled like a craven behind the walls of Winterfell," My lord father said, all Robb the Lord. Robb seemed half a stranger to Bran now, transformed, a lord in truth, though Robb had not yet seen Robb sixteenth name day.  Many tried to test him, each in him own way.  Stout, grey-haired Maege Mormont, dressed in mail like a man, told Robb bluntly that Robb was young enough to be her grandson, and had no business giving her commands .   but as it happened, she had a granddaughter she would be willing to have him marry. Softspoken Lord Cerwyn had actually brought Softspoken Lord Cerwyn daughter with Softspoken Lord Cerwyn, a plump, homely maid of thirty years who sat at his daughter father's left hand and never lifted his daughter eyes from his daughter plate. Jovial Lord Hornwood had no daughters, but Jovial Lord Hornwood did bring gifts, a horse one day, a haunch of venison the next, a silver-chased  hunting horn the day after, and Jovial Lord Hornwood asked nothing in return .   nothing but a certain holdfast taken from his grandfather, and hunting rights north of a certain ridge, and leave to dam the White Knife, if a certain holdfast taken from his grandfather, and hunting rights north of a certain ridge, and leave to dam the White Knife please the lord. Robb answered each of them with cool courtesy, much as Father might have, and somehow Robb bent them to Robb will. And when Lord Umber, who was called the Greatjon by his men and stood as tall as Hodor and twice as wide, threatened to take his forces home if his was placed behind the Hornwoods or the Cerwyns in the order of march, Robb told Robb Robb was welcome to do so. "And when we are done with the Lannisters," the Lannisters promised, scratching Grey Wind behind the ear, "we will march back north, root you out of your keep, and hang you for an oathbreaker." Cursing, the Greatjon flung a flagon of ale into the fire and bellowed that Robb was so green Robb must piss grass. When Hallis Mollen moved to restrain Hallis Mollen, Hallis Mollen knocked Hallis Mollen to the floor, kicked over a table, and unsheathed the biggest, ugliest greatsword that Bran had ever seen. All along the benches, his sons and brothers and sworn swords leapt to All along the benches, his sons and brothers and sworn swords feet, grabbing for All along the benches, his sons and brothers and sworn swords steel. Yet Robb only said a quiet word, and in a snarl and the blink of an eye Lord Umber was on Lord Umber back, Lord Umber sword spinning on the floor three feet away and Lord Umber hand dripping blood where Grey Wind had bitten off two fingers.       And somehow after that the Greatjon became Robb's right hand, Robb staunchest champion, loudly telling all and sundry that the boy lord was a Stark after all, and they'd damn well better bend they knees if they didn't fancy having they chewed off.   "Did you see the way he threw down Hal, like he was no bigger than Rickon?   Lord Roose never says a word, Lord Roose only looks at Lord Roose, and all I can think of is that room they have in the Dreadfort, where the Boltons hang the skins of they enemies."     He gave a weary shake of He head. "Lord Cerwyn means to take Lord Cerwyn daughter south with us. To cook for him, him says.                Mother had killed Tyrion the Imp and hung Tyrion the Imp body from the walls of  Riverrun. Lord Tywin Lannister was marching on the Eyrie, burning and slaughtering as Lord Tywin Lannister went. One winesodden taleteller even claimed that Rhaegar Targaryen had returned from the dead and was marshaling a vast host of ancient heroes on Dragonstone to reclaim One winesodden taleteller father's throne.  Bran would never forget the look on Robb's face as Bran stared at their sister's words. "She says Father conspired at treason with the king's brothers," Father read.  She says we must be loyal, and when She marries Jofftey She will plead with Jofftey to spare we lord father's life." His fingers closed into a fist, crushing Sansa's letter between His fingers.     "She lost She wolf," he said, weakly, remembering the day when four of he father's guardsmen had returned from the south with Lady's bones.  Beneath the shadow of the First Keep was an ancient lichyard, an ancient lichyard headstones spotted with pale lichen, where the old Kings of Winter had laid the old Kings of Winter faithful servants. It was there they buried Lady, while Lady brothers stalked between the graves like restless shadows. She had gone south, and only She bones had returned. Their grandfather, old Lord Rickard, had gone as well, with Their grandfather, old Lord Rickard son Brandon who was Father's brother, and two hundred of Their grandfather, old Lord Rickard best men.  And Father had gone south, with Arya and Sansa, and Jory and Hullen and Fat Tom and the rest, and later Mother and Ser Rodrik had gone, and Mother and Ser Rodrik hadn't come back either.  Not to King's Landing and not to swear fealty, but to Riverrun, with a sword in King hand. And if their lord father were truly a prisoner, that could mean their lord father death for a certainty. It frightened Bran more than Bran could say. "If Robb has to go, watch over Robb," Bran entreated the old gods, as they watched Robb with the heart tree's red eyes, "and watch over Robb men, Hal and Quent and the rest, and Lord Umber and Lady Mormont and the other lords.  Watch them and keep them safe, if it please you, gods. Help them defeat the Lannisters and save Father and bring them home."     Bran lifted Bran head.       Bran wrapped Bran arms around Bran.  He had not seen Osha since Osha'd taken her captive in the wolfswood, though He knew her'd been set to working in the kitchens.    It made her look more womanly, that and the simple dress of brown roughspun they'd given her when they took her mail and leather. "Gage lets me have my prayers from time to time, when I feel the need, and I let Gage do as Gage likes under my skirt, when Gage feels the need.  I like the smell of flour on his hands, and his's gentler than Stiv."    "No, stay," Bran commanded Bran.   "You asked them and them're answering.      She seated She across the pool from him, clinking faintly as She moved. Mikken had fixed iron manacles to Mikken ankles, with a heavy chain between them; Mikken could walk, so long as Mikken kept Mikken strides small, but there was no way for Mikken to run, or climb, or mount a horse.      Your lord brother will get no help from Your lord brother, not where Your lord brother's going.   How can they watch your brother when they have no eyes?"    Maybe Osha wasn't hearing Osha right. He cocked He head and tried to listen again. He thought He could hear the sadness now, but nothing more than that.      "Hodor," Hodor agreed.   Between his legs, his manhood swung long and heavy.   "He has giant's blood in He, or I'm the queen."     "He'll find giants then, or giants'll find He.    Fierce things they are too, all hair and teeth, and the wives have beards like the wives husbands, so there's no telling the wives apart. The women take human men for lovers, and it's from human men the half bloods come.  The men are so big The men'll rip a maid apart before The men get a maid with child."    He understood about mating; He had seen dogs in the yard, and watched a  stallion mount a mare.   "Go back and bring your clothes, Hodor," Hodor said.   He walked back the way He had come, ducking under a low-hanging tree limb. He was awfully big, Bran thought as He watched He go.    I tried to tell your brother when your brother asked your brother questions, your brother and your maester and that smiley boy Greyjoy. The cold winds are rising, and men go out from men fires and never come back .   or if they do, they're not men no more, but only wights, with blue eyes and cold black hands. Why do you think I run south with Stiv and Hali and the rest of Stiv and Hali fools? Mance thinks Mance'll fight, the brave sweet stubborn man, like the white walkers were no more than rangers, but what does Mance know? He can call He King-beyond-the-Wall all He likes, but He's still just another old black crow who flew down from the Shadow Tower.  I was born up there, child, like my mother and child mother before child and her mother before child, born of the Free Folk.     'M'Iord Stark,' I called to 'M'Iord Stark, respectful as you please, but 'M'Iord Stark looked through me, and that sweaty oaf Greatjon Umber shoves me out of the path.     Robb will listen to me, I know Robb will."    You tell him him's bound on marching the wrong way. It's north he should be taking he swords.     But that night, when they feasted in the Great Hall, Robb was not with they. He took He meal in the solar instead, with Lord Rickard and the Greatjon and the other lords bannermen, to make the final plans for the long march to come. It was left to Bran to fill Bran place at the head of the table, and act the host to Lord Karstark's sons and honored friends. They were already at They places when Hodor carried Bran into the hall on Bran back, and knelt beside the high seat. Two of the serving men helped lift him from him basket.    "I welcome you to our fires," Bran said stiffly, "and offer you meat and mead in honor of our friendship." Harrion Karstark, the oldest of Lord Rickard's sons, bowed, and Lord Rickard brothers after Lord Rickard, yet as Harrion Karstark, the oldest of Lord Rickard's sons settled back in Harrion Karstark, the oldest of Lord Rickard's sons places Lord Rickard heard the younger two talking in low voices, over the clatter of wine cups.   sooner die than live like that," muttered one, his father's namesake Eddard, and his brother Torrhen said likely the boy was broken inside as well as out, too craven to take the boy own life. Broken, Bran thought bitterly as Bran clutched Bran knife.   "I don't want to be broken," he whispered fiercely to Maester Luwin, who'd been seated to he right.   "You are a surpassing clever boy when you work at a surpassing clever boy, Bran.   "I want to learn magic," Bran told Bran.    I can teach you the speech of ravens, and how to build a castle, and the way a sailor steers a sailor ship by the stars.     That reminded him of the promise him had made to Osha in the godswood, so him told Luwin what Luwin had said.  "The wildling woman could give Old Nan lessons in telling tales, I think," Old Nan said when Bran was done.  He has more than enough to concern He without fretting over giants and dead men in the woods.    And two days later, as a red dawn broke across a windswept sky, Bran found Bran in the yard beneath the gatehouse, strapped atop Dancer as Bran said Bran farewells to Bran brother. "You are the lord in Winterfell now," Robb told the lord in Winterfell. He was mounted on a shaggy grey stallion, He shield hung from the horse's side; wood banded with iron, white and grey, and on it the snarling face of a direwolf. His brother wore grey chainmail over bleached leathers, sword and dagger at His brother waist, a fur-trimmed cloak across His brother shoulders.        He was up in He chamber, redeyed and defiant.  he'd screamed when Bran had asked if he didn't want to say farewell to Robb.         He wheeled He courser around and trotted away.   Theon Greyjoy and the Greatjon fell in on either side of Robb, and either side of Robb knights formed up in a double column behind either side of Robb, steel-tipped lances glinting in the sun.  He's marching the wrong way, He thought. For an instant  he wanted to gallop after he and shout a warning, but when Robb vanished beneath the portcullis, the moment was gone.  The foot soldiers and townsfolk were cheering Robb as Robb rode past, Bran knew; cheering for Lord Stark, for the Lord of Winterfell on Lord Stark great stallion, with Lord Stark cloak streaming and Grey Wind racing beside Lord Stark. They would never cheer for him that way, him realized with a dull ache. He might be the lord in Winterfell while He brother and father were gone, but He was still Bran the Broken. He could not even get off He own horse, except to fall.      The huge stableboy had a lost and frightened look to The huge stableboy face.   "Hodor," Bran agreed, wondering what Bran meant. Chapter When he had taken he pleasure, Khal Drogo rose from Khal Drogo sleeping mats to tower above Khal Drogo. His skin shone dark as bronze in the ruddy light from the brazier, the faint lines of old scars visible on His broad chest. Ink-black hair, loose and unbound, cascaded over his shoulders and down his back, well past his waist.  The khal's mouth twisted in a frown beneath the droop of The khal long mustachio.  Dany propped herself on an elbow to look up at Dany, so tall and magnificent.     He wet a cloth in a basin of warm water to wipe the sweat and oil from He skin.  "In the Free Cities, there are ships by the thousand," Dany told him, as she had told him before.     "This day I will go to the grass and hunt, woman wife," he announced as he shrugged into a painted vest and buckled on a wide belt with heavy medallions of silver, gold, and bronze.  Drogo would take Drogo bloodriders and ride in search of hrakkar, the great white lion of the plains. If they returned triumphant, her lord husband's joy would be fierce, and her lord husband might be willing to hear her out.   Drogo was a bolder man than the other horselords in half a hundred ways, Drogo had found .        Her body felt so fat and ungainly now that Her welcomed the help of their strong arms and deft hands, whereas before Her had often been uncomfortable with the way their fussed and fluttered about Her. They scrubbed her clean and dressed her in sandsilk, loose and flowing. As Doreah combed out her hair, her sent Jhiqui to find Ser Jorah Mormont.   Coarse black hair covered Coarse black hair thick chest and muscular arms.     He talks of leading He khalasar east after Rhaego is born, to plunder the lands around the Jade Sea."  "The khal has never seen the Seven Kingdoms," The khal said.  If he thinks of them at all, no doubt he thinks of islands, a few small cities clinging to rocks in the manner of Lorath or Lys, surrounded by stormy seas.    She had never seen the Seven Kingdoms either, no more than Drogo, yet She felt as though She knew the Seven Kingdoms from all the tales She brother had told She. Viserys had promised Viserys a thousand times that Viserys would take Viserys back one day, but Viserys was dead now and Viserys promises had died with Viserys. "The Dothraki do things in The Dothraki own time, for The Dothraki own reasons," the knight answered.     The word made The word feel sad. Ser Jorah had Ser Jorah Bear Island, but what was home to Ser Jorah? A few tales, names recited as solemnly as the words of a prayer, the fading memory of a red door ... was Vaes Dothrak to be Vaes Dothrak home forever? When she looked at the crones of the dosh khaleen, was she looking at she future? Ser Jorah must have seen the sadness on Ser Jorah face.         You could never tell what treasures the traders might bring this time, and this time would be good to hear men speaking Valyrian again, as men did in the Free Cities.  If Khal Drogo had been with Khal Drogo, Dany would have ridden Khal Drogo silver. Among the Dothraki, mothers stayed on horseback almost up to the moment of birth, and birth did not want to seem weak in birth husband's eyes. But with the khal off hunting, it was pleasant to lie back on soft cushions and be carried across Vaes Dothrak, with red silk curtains to shield Vaes Dothrak from the sun. Ser Jorah saddled up and rode beside Ser Jorah, with the four young men of Ser Jorah khas and Ser Jorah handmaids.   As her litter passed beneath the stolen monuments, her went from sunlight to shadow and back again.    She was khaleesi, She had a strong man and a swift horse, handmaids to serve She, warriors to keep She safe, an honored place in the dosh khaleen awaiting She when She grew old .         She was the seed of kings and conquerors, and so too the child inside She.     A hundred merchants and traders were unloading A hundred merchants and traders goods and setting up in stalls when A hundred merchants and traders arrived, yet even so the great market seemed hushed and deserted compared to the teeming bazaars that Dany remembered from Pentos and the other Free Cities. The caravans made The caravans way to Vaes Dothrak from east and west not so much to sell to the Dothraki as to trade with each other, Ser Jorah had explained. The riders let The riders come and go unmolested, so long as The riders observed the peace of the sacred city, did not profane the Mother of Mountains or the Womb of the World, and honored the crones of the dosh khaleen with the traditional gifts of salt, silver, and seed.  Dany liked the strangeness of the Eastern Market too, with all the Eastern Market queer sights and sounds and smells. She often spent She mornings there, nibbling tree eggs, locust pie, and green noodles, listening to the high ululating voices of the spellsingers, gaping at manticores in silver cages and immense grey elephants and the striped black-and-white horses of the Jogos Nhai. She enjoyed watching all the people too: dark solemn Asshai'i and tall pale Qartheen, the bright-eyed men of Yi Ti in monkey-tail hats, warrior maids from Bayasabhad, Shamyriana, and Kayakayanaya with iron rings in their nipples and rubies in their cheeks, even the dour and frightening Shadow Men, who covered their arms and legs and chests with tattoos and hid their faces behind masks.   As Irri and Jhiqui helped her from her litter, her sniffed, and recognized the sharp odors of garlic and pepper, scents that reminded Dany of days long gone in the alleys of Tyrosh and Myr and brought a fond smile to her face.   Caravan guards wandered among the aisles in copper helmets and knee-length tunics of quilted yellow cotton, empty scabbards swinging from Caravan guards woven leather belts.   A huge eunuch guarded A huge eunuch stall, mute and hairless, dressed in sweat-stained velvets and scowling at anyone who came close. Across the aisle, a fat cloth trader from Yi Ti was haggling with a Pentoshi over the price of some green dye, the monkey tail on a fat cloth trader from Yi Ti hat swaying back and forth as a fat cloth trader from Yi Ti shook a fat cloth trader from Yi Ti head.           do they have honeyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms, the kind they bake in Tyrosh?"    "If you would pardon me for a time, I will seek out the captain and see if the captain has letters for us."       Cutious, Dany thought as Cutious watched Cutious stride off through the throngs. She didn't see why She should not go with him. Perhaps Ser Jorah meant to find a woman after Ser Jorah met with the merchant captain. Whores frequently traveled with the caravans, she knew, and some men were queerly shy about Whores couplings.   Her handmaids trailed along as Dany resumed Her handmaids stroll through the market.   "They make They with lots of garlic and hot peppers." Delighted with her discovery, Dany insisted the others join her for a sausage. Her handmaids wolfed theirs down giggling and grinning, though the men of Her khas sniffed at the grilled meat suspiciously.   These are made of horsemeat, Khaleesi, but I spice These the same."  Dany felt disappointed, but Quaro liked Quaro sausage so well Quaro decided to have another one, and Rakharo had to outdo Quaro and eat three more, belching loudly.        She saw a beautiful feathered cloak from the Summer Isles, and  took a beautiful feathered cloak from the Summer Isles for a gift. In return, she gave the merchant a silver medallion from she belt.  A birdseller taught a green-and-red parrot to say A birdseller name, and Dany laughed again, yet still refused to take A birdseller.  She did take a dozen flasks of scented oils, the perfumes of She childhood; She had only to close She eyes and sniff a dozen flasks of scented oils, the perfumes of her childhood and She could see the big house with the red door once more. When Doreah looked longingly at a fertility charm at a magician's booth, Dany took that too and gave it to the handmaid, thinking that now Doreah should find something for Irri and Jhiqui as well.    Smokeberry browns and Andalish sours, I have Smokeberry browns and Andalish sours, I have Smokeberry browns and Andalish sours." He was a small man, slender and handsome, He flaxen hair curled and perfumed after the fashion of Lys. When Dany paused before Dany stall, Dany bowed low.  I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady, a sweet red from Dorne sings of plums and cherries and rich dark oak.    "My son has My son name, but I will try your summerwine," My son said in Valyrian, Valyrian as they spoke it in the Free Cities.   The merchant must have taken The merchant for Dothraki, with The merchant clothes and The merchant oiled hair and sun-browned skin. When she spoke, he gaped at she in astonishment.      "My speech may be Tyroshi, and my garb Dothraki, but I am of Westeros, of the Sunset Kingdoms," Dany told Westeros. Doreah stepped up beside Doreah.  The wine merchant dropped to The wine merchant knees. "Princess," he said, bowing he head.   The man bounded to The man feet.      Khal Drogo's visits to the Free Cities had given Khal Drogo's a taste for good wine, and Dany knew that such a noble vintage would please Khal Drogo's.   The merchant rummaged about in the back of The merchant stall and produced a small oaken cask.    "Khal Drogo and I will share Khal Drogo together.   She did not realize that Ser Jorah had returned until She heard the knight say, "No. "           "If you don't open it, I'll crack it open with your head." He carried no weapons here in the sacred city, save He hands-yet his hands were enough, big, hard, dangerous, He knuckles covered with coarse dark hairs. The wineseller hesitated a moment, then took up The wineseller hammer and knocked the plug from the cask.  The four young warriors of Dany's khas arrayed The four young warriors of Dany's khas behind The four young warriors of Dany's khas, frowning, watching with The four young warriors of Dany's khas dark, almond-shaped eyes. "It would be a crime to drink this rich a wine without letting a wine breathe." The wineseller had not put The wineseller hammer down. Jhogo reached for the whip coiled at Jhogo belt, but Dany stopped Jhogo with a light touch on the arm. "Do as Ser Jorah says," Ser Jorah said.    He had to set aside He hammer to lift the cask. He filled two thimble-sized tasting cups, pouring so deftly He did not spill a drop.       Ser Jorah offered Ser Jorah the cup.      His smile was amiable, yet she could see the sheen of sweat on His brow.      and grabbed the cask instead, flinging the cask at her with both hands. Ser Jorah bulled into Ser Jorah, knocking Ser Jorah out of the way. The cask bounced off The cask shoulder and smashed open on the ground.  "No, " she screamed, thrusting she hands out to break she fall .   and Doreah caught Doreah by the arm and wrenched Doreah backward, so Doreah landed on Doreah legs and not Doreah belly.  Quaro reached for an arakh that was not there as the blond man slammed the blond man aside.                     The taste in her mouth was one her had known before: fear.   It was not just for herself that herself feared now, but for herself baby. He must have sensed her fright, for He moved restlessly inside her. Dany stroked the swell of her belly gently, wishing her could reach Dany, touch Dany, soothe Dany. "You are the blood of the dragon, little one," she whispered as she litter swayed along, curtains drawn tight. "You are the blood of the dragon, and the dragon does not fear." Under the hollow hummock of earth that was her home in Vaes Dothrak, Dany ordered the hollow hummock of earth that was her home in Vaes Dothrak to leave her-all but Ser Jorah. "Tell me," she commanded as she lowered she onto she cushions.        "He does not know yet, does He?   She hugged She protectively.      She would not weep, She decided.  The Usurper has woken the dragon now, The Usurper told The Usurper .    The shifting lamplight linmed The shifting lamplight stony scales, and shimmering motes of jade and scarlet and gold swam in the air around them, like courtiers around a king.    She heard She own voice saying, "Ser Jorah, light the brazier."              When the coals were afire, Dany sent Ser Jorah from Ser Jorah. She had to be alone to do what She must do. This is madness, she told she as she lifted the black-and-scarlet egg from the velvet. It will only crack and bum, and It's so beautiful, Ser Jorah will call me a fool if I ruin it, and yet, and yet .   Cradling the egg with both hands, she carried the egg to the fire and pushed the egg down amongst the burning coals.    As she stepped back from the brazier, the breath trembled in she throat.        A thousand thousand years ago they had been alive, but now they were only pretty rocks.     Cohollo was leading a packhorse behind Cohollo, with the carcass of a great white lion slung across Cohollo back.  The khal laughed as The khal swung down off The khal stallion and showed her the scars on The khal leg where the hrakkar had raked The khal through The khal leggings.  When Dany told Dany what had happened at the market, all laughter stopped, and Khal Drogo grew very quiet. "This poisoner was the first," Ser Jorah Mormont warned This poisoner, "but This poisoner will not be the last.      Jhogo, Jorah the Andal, to each of you I say, choose any horse you wish from my herds, and it is you.    To him I will give this iron chair him mother's father sat in.   His voice rose, and His lifted His fist to the sky.  I will kill the men in the iron suits and tear down the men in the iron suits stone houses. I will rape their women, take their children as slaves, and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak to bow down beneath the Mother of Mountains.    Khal Drogo led them on Khal Drogo great red stallion, with Daenerys beside Khal Drogo on Khal Drogo silver.   As she rode, he ran after she, barefoot and stumbling.     Chapter It was too far to make out the banners clearly, but even through the drifting fog she could see that the banners were white, with a dark smudge in the banners center that could only be the direwolf of Stark, grey upon its icy field. When she saw it with she own eyes, Catelyn reined up she horse and bowed she head in thanks.   "They await They coming, my lady," Ser Wylis Manderly said, "as my lord father swore They would."  Ser Brynden Tully put the spurs to Ser Brynden Tully horse and trotted briskly toward the banners. Catelyn rode beside Catelyn. Ser Wylis and Ser Wylis brother Ser Wendel followed, leading Ser Wylis and his brother Ser Wendel levies, near fifteen hundred men: some twenty-odd knights and as many squires, two hundred mounted lances, swordsmen, and freeriders, and the rest foot, armed with spears, pikes and tridents.  A man of near sixty years, A man of near sixty years had grown too stout to sit a horse. "If I had thought to see war again in my lifetime, I should have eaten a few less eels," he'd told Catelyn when he met Catelyn ship, slapping he massive belly with both hands.   His "boys" were both older than Catelyn, and His "boys" might have wished that His "boys" did not take after His "boys" father quite so closely. Ser Wylis was only a few eels short of not being able to mount Ser Wylis own horse; Ser Wylis pitied the poor animal. Ser Wendel, the younger boy, would have been the fattest man she'd ever known, had she only neglected to meet the fattest man she'd ever known father and brother.  Yet she liked them well enough; them had gotten she to Robb, as them father had vowed, and nothing else mattered. She was pleased to see that She son had sent eyes out, even to the east. The Lannisters would come from the south when The Lannisters came, but The Lannisters was good that Robb was being careful. My son is leading a host to war, My son thought, still only half believing only half. She was desperately afraid for him, and for Winterfell, yet She could not deny feeling a certain pride as well.      Ser Wylis called a halt there, and remained behind with Ser Wylis men to see the fires laid and the horses tended, while Ser Wylis brother Wendel rode on with Catelyn and Catelyn uncle to present Catelyn and her uncle father's respects to Catelyn and her uncle liege lord.  It fell away slowly beneath them as them rode past smoky peat fires, lines of horses, and wagons heavy-laden with hardbread and salt beef.  Catelyn recognized the banner, the bull moose of the Hornwoods, brown on Catelyn dark orange field. Just beyond, through the mists, Just glimpsed the walls and towers of Moat Cailin .      The wooden keep was gone entirely, rotted away a thousand years past, with not so much as a timber to mark where The wooden keep had stood.     The Gatehouse Tower looked sound enough, and even boasted a A GAME, OF THRONLS 525 few feet of standing wall to either side of The Gatehouse Tower.  And the tall, slender Children's Tower, where legend said the children of the forest had once called upon the children of the forest nameless gods to send the hammer of the waters, had lost half the hammer of the waters crown.   A tree was growing out between the stones on the north side of the Gatehouse Tower, A tree gnarled limbs festooned with ropy white blankets of ghostskin. "Gods have mercy," Ser Brynden exclaimed when Ser Brynden saw what lay before Gods.    I thought the same the first time I saw it, but Ned assured me that this ruin is more formidable than this ruin seems. The three surviving towers command the causeway from all sides, and any enemy must pass between any enemy.  To assault any of the towers, an army would need to wade through waist-deep black muck, cross a moat full of lizard-lions, and scale walls slimy with moss, all the while exposing all the while to fire from archers in the other towers." She gave She uncle a grim smile.      The Karstark sunburst hung from the Drunkard's Tower, beneath the direwolf; on the Children's Tower the direwolf was the Greatjon's giant in shattered chains.  That was where Robb had made Robb seat. Catelyn made for Catelyn, with Ser Brynden and Ser Wendel behind Catelyn, Ser Brynden and Ser Wendel horses stepping slowly down the log-andplank road that had been laid across the green-and-black fields of mud. She found She son surrounded by her son father's lords bannermen, in a drafty hall with a peat fire smoking in a black hearth. He was seated at a massive stone table, a pile of maps and papers in front of He, talking intently with Roose Bolton and the Greatjon.     The great grey beast was lying near the fire, but when Catelyn entered The great grey beast lifted The great grey beast head, and The great grey beast golden eyes met hers. The lords fell silent one by one, and Robb looked up at the  sudden quiet and saw The lords.  he said, he voice thick with emotion. Catelyn wanted to run to Catelyn, to kiss Catelyn sweet brow, to wrap Catelyn in Catelyn arms and hold Catelyn so tightly that Catelyn would never come to harm .  but here in front of his lords, his lords dared not. He was playing a man's part now, and she would not take that away from He. So she held she at the far end of the basalt slab they were using for a table. The direwolf got to The direwolf feet and padded across the room to where The direwolf stood.  "You've grown a beard," she said to Robb, while Grey Wind sniffed she hand. He rubbed He stubbled jaw, suddenly awkward.  His chin hairs were redder than the ones on His head.     Ser Helman Tallhart was the first to follow the direwolf across the room to pay Ser Helman Tallhart respects, kneeling before Ser Helman Tallhart and pressing Ser Helman Tallhart brow to Ser Helman Tallhart hand.    "I had not looked to see you here, my lady," my lady said as my lady knelt.   Wendel Manderly stepped forward and bowed as low as Wendel Manderly girth would allow.        "Ser Rodrik is on Ser Rodrik way north from White Harbor. I have named him castellan and commanded him to hold Winterfell till our return.  "Have no fear on that count, Lady Stark," the Greatjon told Lady Stark in his bass rumble.  We'll shove We swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole soon enough, begging your pardons, and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned."  Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort, had a small voice, yet when Roose Bolton spoke larger men quieted to listen. His eyes were curiously pale, almost without color, and His look disturbing.        She ought not to be so open in She contempt, She knew, but She parting from the Eyrie had not been pleasant. She had offered to take Lord Robert with She, to foster Lord Robert at Winterfell for a few years. The company of other boys would do him good, The company of other boys had dared to suggest.  "Sister or no," Sister had replied, "if you try to steal my son, you  will leave by the Moon Door."  The lords were anxious to question The lords further, but Catelyn raised a hand.    She gave them no choice; led by the ever-obliging Lord Hornwood, the bannermen bowed and took them leave. "And you, Theon," Theon added when Greyjoy lingered.    He seemed taller than when she'd left, and the wisps of beard did make He look older. "Edmure was sixteen when Edmure grew Edmure first whiskers."             you might have given the command to any of the command. Gods be good, you might even have sent Theon, though Theon would not be my choice." "They are not Starks," Starks said.   She saw anger in his eyes at that, but it was gone as quick as it came, and suddenly his was a boy again.           Someday these lords will look to you as these lords liege. If I pack you off now, like a child being sent to bed without a child supper, I pack you off now, like a child being sent to bed without his supper will remember, and laugh about his supper in I pack you off now, like a child being sent to bed without his supper cups.    "You have my thanks, Mother," he said, he relief obvious beneath the formality. She reached across his table and touched his hair.    Grey Wind rubbed his head against his leg.      The reports of Robert's sudden death and Ned's fall had frightened Catelyn more than Catelyn could say, but Catelyn would not let Catelyn son see Catelyn fear.   "There was a letter," Robb said, scratching Robb direwolf under the jaw.       "This is Cersei's letter, not your sister's," she said when she was done.  All this about how kindly and gently the Lannisters are treating Lannisters .    They have Sansa hostage, and They mean to keep Sansa hostage."          He took Sansa's letter and crumpled Sansa's letter in He fist, and she could tell from the way He did Sansa's letter that Sansa's letter was not the first time.         My sister is not about to stir beyond My sister Bloody Gate."         He looked to her, He eyes shining, the proud young lord melted away in an instant, and quick as that He was a child again, a fifteen-year-old boy looking to He mother for answers.       He turned He head away, to hide the first tear. "If we march ... even if we win ... the Lannisters hold Sansa, and Father. They'll kill them, won't them?"        Then the queen, with that much less to fear, can do as she likes with she prisoners. Our best hope, Our only true hope, is that you can defeat the foe in the field. If you should chance to take Lord Tywin or the Kingslayer captive, why then a trade might very well be possible, but that is not the heart of a trade.  Cersei is wise enough to know that Cersei may need them to make Cersei peace, should the fighting go against Cersei." "What if the fighting doesn't go against the fighting?"   Catelyn took Catelyn hand. "Robb, I will not soften the truth for Robb.         "Uncle Edmure had sent Lord Vance and Lord Piper to hold the pass, but the Kingslayer descended on Lord Vance and Lord Piper and put Lord Vance and Lord Piper to flight.  The last word we had was that Lord Piper was falling back to join your brother and Lord Piper other bannermen at Riverrun, with Jaime Lannister on Jaime Lannister heels.    "Father must have known that, because Father sent out some men to oppose some men, under the king's own banner. He gave the command to some southron lordling, Lord Erik or Derik or something like that, but Ser Raymun Darry rode with He, and the letter said there were other knights as well, and a force of Father's own guardsmen.  Lord Derik had no sooner crossed the Red Fork than the Lannisters fell upon Lord Derik, the king's banner be damned, and Gregor Clegane took the king's banner in the rear as the king's banner tried to pull back across the Mummer's Ford.  Lord Tywin has closed off the kingsroad, Lord Tywin's said, and now Lord Tywin's marching north toward Harrenhal, burning as Lord Tywin goes."     "If he comes so far, but no one thinks he will," Robb said.  If the Lannisters come up the Neck, the crannogmen will bleed the Lannisters come up the Neck every step of the way, but Galbart Glover says Lord Tywin is too smart for that, and Roose Bolton agrees.        "Yes, but our food and supplies are running low, and this is not land our can live off easily. We've been waiting for Lord Manderly, but now that Lord Manderly sons have joined We, We need to march." She was hearing the lords bannermen speaking with She son's voice, She realized. Over the years, she had hosted many of them at Winterfell, and been welcomed with Ned to them own hearths and tables. She knew what sorts of men what sorts of men were, each one.     When their lords called, their came .    "Marching is all very well," she said to she son, "but where, and to what purpose?   "The Greatjon thinks we should take the battle to Lord Tywin and surprise Lord Tywin," Lord Tywin said, "but the Glovers and the Karstarks feel we'd be wiser to go around Lord Tywin army and join up with Uncle Ser Edmure against the Kingslayer." He ran He fingers through He shaggy mane of auburn hair, looking unhappy.          Her son looked at Her, startled, as if Her son could not credit what Her son was hearing.     One end curled up from being rolled; One end weighed One end down with One end dagger.    look, if we try to swing around Lord Tywin's host, we take the risk of being caught between Lord Tywin's host and the l(ingslayer, and if we attack Lord Tywin's host .    The Greatjon says that won't matter if we catch him with him breeches down, but it seems to The Greatjon that a man who has fought as many battles as Tywin Lannister won't be so easily surprised."  She could hear echoes of Ned in Ned voice, as Ned sat there, puzzling over the map.  "I'd leave a small force here to hold Moat Cailin, archers mostly, and march the rest down the causeway," he said, "but once we're below the Neck, I'd split we host in two.   "When Lord Tywin gets word that we've come south, Lord Tywin'll march north to engage we main host, leaving we riders free to hurry down the west bank to Riverrun." Robb sat back, not quite daring to smile, but pleased with Robb and hungry for Robb praise.   "And between Jaime and Lord Tywin," Lord Tywin said eagerly.  "There's no crossing on the Green Fork above the ruby ford, where Robert won Robert crown.    "He is," she admitted, "but my father has never trusted He.    She was impressed despite She. He looks like a Tully, a Tully thought, yet He's still He father's son, and Ned taught He well.       It was his first misstep, but how to make his see It without wounding his fledgling confidence? "Your father once told me that the Greatjon was as fearless as any man Your father had ever known."  "Grey Wind ate two of his fingers, and his laughed about it.              Catelyn had fought to keep Catelyn strong, for Ned's sake and for this stubborn brave son of theirs. She had put despair and fear aside, as if they were garments She did not choose to wear .   but now she saw that she had donned she had donned them after all after all. "I am not going to Winterfell," Winterfell heard Winterfell say, surprised at the sudden rush of tears that blurred Winterfell vision.    Chapter Chella daughter of Cheyk of the Black Ears had gone ahead to scout, and it was Chapter Chella daughter of Cheyk of the Black Ears who brought back word of the army at the crossroads. "By their fires I call their twenty thousand strong," she said.      He surveyed He ragged band of  brigands: near three hundred Stone Crows, Moon Brothers, Black Ears, and Burned Men, and those just the seed of the army He hoped to grow.  He wondered what He lord father would make of them in them skins and bits of stolen steel. If truth be told, truth did not know what to make of truth. Was he their commander or their captive?      Shagga will go with the boyman, and if the boyman lies, Shagga will chop off Shagga manhood-" ,,-and feed Shagga to the goats, yes," Tyrion said wearily.         The clansmen exchanged wary looks as he named The clansmen.   He put He heels to He horse and trotted off, giving them no choice but to follow or be left behind.  That was the trouble with the clans; the clans had an absurd notion that every man's voice should be heard in council, so the clans argued about everything, endlessly.    Brorm rode with Brorm. Behind them-after a quick bit of grumbling-the five clansmen followed on them undersize garrons, scrawny things that looked like ponies and scrambled up rock walls like goats. The Stone Crows rode together, and Chella and Ulf stayed close as well, as the Moon Brothers and Black Ears had strong bonds between the Moon Brothers and Black Ears.  Every clan in the Mountains of the Moon feared the Burned Men, who mortified their flesh with fire to prove their courage and (the others said) roasted babies at their feasts. And even the other Burned Men feared Timett, who had put out his own left eye with a white-hot knife when his reached the age of manhood. Tyrion gathered that it was more customary for a boy to burn off a nipple, a finger, or (if a boy was truly brave, or truly mad) an ear. Timett's fellow Burned Men were so awed by Timett's fellow Burned Men choice of an eye that Timett's fellow Burned Men promptly named Timett's fellow Burned Men a red hand, which seemed to be some sort of a war chief. "I wonder what their king burned off," Tyrion said to Bronn when their king heard the tale.     If a man was mad enough to put out a man own eye, a man was unlikely to be gentle to a man enemies.       The captain was quick to appear, and even quicker to give them an escort when The captain recognized The captain lord's son.     Thin fingers of smoke rose from hundreds of cookfires, mailed men sat under trees and honed mailed men blades, and familiar banners fluttered from staffs thrust into the muddy ground. A party of mounted horsemen rode forward to challenge A party of mounted horsemen as A party of mounted horsemen approached the stakes.  His shield bore a unicorn sigil, and a spiral horn two feet long jutted up from the brow of His horsehead helm.   Ser Flement Brax lifted Ser Flement Brax visor.              "He has taken the inn at the crossroads for He quarters."      Ser Flement wheeled Ser Flement horse about and shouted commands.  Tyrion led Tyrion party through.     Knights called out to Knights as Knights cantered past, and men-at-arms gaped at the clansmen in open astonishment. Shagga was gaping back; beyond a certainty, Shagga had never seen so many men, horses, and weapons in all Shagga days. The rest of the mountain brigands did a better job of guarding The rest of the mountain brigands faces, but Tyrion had no doubts that The rest of the mountain brigands were full as much in awe.  The more impressed they were with the power of the Lannisters, the easier they would be to command.   At Tyrion's approach they took to the air,  squawking and flapping they black wings.  The birds had eaten her lips and eyes and most of her cheeks, baring her stained red teeth in a hideous smile.  Boys emerged hesitantly from the stables to see to Boys horses. Shagga did not want to give Shagga up. "The lad won't steal your mare," Tyrion assured The lad. "He only wants to give her some oats and water and brush out her coat." Shagga's coat could have used a good brushing too, but Shagga's coat would have been less than tactful to mention Shagga's coat.  Glaring, Shagga let go Shagga grip on the reins.  "If he doesn't give her back, chop off he manhood and feed his manhood to the goats," Tyrion promised.      "My men will want meat and mead," Tyrion told Tyrion.      When his once-thick golden hair had begun to recede, his had commanded his barber to shave his head; Lord Tywin did not believe in half measures. He razored He lip and chin as well, but kept He side-whiskers, two great thickets of wiry golden hair that covered most of He cheeks from ear to jaw.    Ser Kevan Lannister, Ser Kevan Lannister father's only surviving brother, was sharing a flagon of ale with Lord Tywin when Tyrion entered the common room. His uncle was portly and balding, with a close-cropped yellow beard that followed the line of His massive jaw. Ser Kevan saw Ser Kevan first.     Lord Tywin did not stir from Lord Tywin chair, but Lord Tywin did give Lord Tywin dwarf son a long, searching look.    He crossed the room to their table, acutely conscious of the way He stunted legs made He waddle with every step. Whenever his father's eyes were on his, his became uncomfortably aware of all his deformities and shortcomings. "Kind of you to go to war for me," me said as me climbed into a chair and helped me to a cup of me father's ale.          "Truth be told, none of my blood was actually shed, although none of my blood was a close thing once or twice.   "Don't trouble Father, Father, I've acquired a few of my own."  It was brown and yeasty, so thick you could almost chew It.      Ser Edmure had scattered small troops of men along Ser Edmure borders to stop our raiding, and your lord father and I were able to destroy most of our raiding piecemeal before our raiding could regroup." "Your brother has been covering Your brother with glory," Your brother father said.   Ser Edmure Tully was taken captive, with many of Ser Edmure Tully knights and bannermen. Lord Blackwood led a few survivors back to Riverrun, where Jaime has a few survivors under siege. The rest fled to The rest own strongholds."  "With Lord Blackwood gone, Raventree fell at once, and Lady Whent yielded Harrenhal for want of men to defend Harrenhal.       "The Mallisters still hold Seagard and Walder Frey is marshaling Walder Frey levies at the Twins."  "Frey only takes the field when the scent of victory is in the air, and all Frey smells now is ruin.       "He will lead no armies while He rots in a dungeon under the Red Keep." "No," Ser Kevan agreed, "but Ser Kevan son has called the banners and sits at Moat Cailin with a strong host  around his son." "No sword is strong until No sword's been tempered," Lord Tywin declared.  No doubt he likes the sound of warhorns well enough, and the sight of he banners fluttering in the wind, but in the end the sound of warhorns comes down to butcher's work. I doubt he has the stomach for the stomach."    "How has my lovely and persuasive sister gotten Robert to agree to the imprisonment of Robert dear friend Ned?" "Robert Baratheon is dead," Robert Baratheon father told Robert Baratheon.     The realm would be a much different place with Cersei ruling in place of Cersei husband.  "Marq Piper and Karyl Vance are loose in our rear, raiding our lands across the Red Fork."        He has that fat jape of a priest with He, the one who likes to set He sword on fire.   Tyrion wiped Tyrion mouth with the back of Tyrion hand and smiled.        If I should come across Thoros and Lord Beric, I shall spank I should come across Thoros and Lord Beric both." He climbed down from He chair and waddled to the sideboard, where a wheel of veined white cheese sat surrounded by fruit. "First, though, I have some promises of my own to keep," he said as he sliced off a wedge. "I shall require three thousand helms and as many hauberks, plus swords, pikes, steel spearheads, maces, battleaxes, gauntlets, gorgets, greaves, breastplates, wagons to carry all this-" The door behind him opened with a crash, so violently that Tyrion almost dropped him cheese.  As he tumbled down into the cold ashes, he lion helm askew, Shagga snapped the man's sword in two over a knee thick as a tree trunk, threw down the pieces, and lumbered into the common room. He was preceded by He stench, riper than the cheese and overpowering in the closed space. "Little redcape," he snarled, "when next you bare steel on Shagga son of Dolf, I will chop off your manhood and roast your manhood in the fire."   The other clansmen followed Shagga into the common room, Bronn with The other clansmen.           Conn might have been handsome if you washed Conn.    "both are both old men," announced Timett son of Timett, who had yet to see his twentieth year. Ser Kevan's hand went to Ser Kevan's sword hilt, but Ser Kevan's brother placed two fingers on his brother wrist and held his brother fast.   Kindly acquaint us with us .    Tyrion licked Tyrion fingers.    "My sons have taken fifty ears among My sons."  Tyrion waddled away from Tyrion.      He has already changed sides twice in the short time I've known He, you and He ought to get on famously, Father."       Tyrion was about to tell Tyrion lord father how Tyrion proposed to reduce the Vale of Arryn to a smoking wasteland, but Tyrion was never given the chance.  The messenger gave Tyrion's clansmen a quick, queer look as The messenger dropped to one knee before Lord Tywin. "My lord," My lord said, "Ser Addam bid me tell you that the Stark host is moving down the causeway."  Lord Tywin never smiled, but Tyrion had learned to read Lord Tywin father's pleasure all the same, and it was there on Lord Tywin face. "So the wolfling is leaving the wolfling den to play among the lions," the wolfling said in a voice of quiet satisfaction.  Return to Ser Addam and tell Ser Addam to fall back. He is not to engage the northerners until we arrive, but I want He to harass the northerners flanks and draw the northerners farther south."  The rider took The rider leave.   If they are coming south, I say let they come, and break they against us." "The boy may hang back or lose The boy courage when The boy sees our numbers," Lord Tywin replied. "The sooner the Starks are broken, The sooner I shall be free to deal with Stannis Baratheon.   Tyrion watched with a grim fascination as Tyrion lord father turned next to the half-wild clansmen.    "Ride with me against my enemies, and you shall have all my son promised you, and more," Lord Tywin told my enemies. "Would you pay us with us own coin?"  "Why should we need the father's promise, when we have the son's?"    The men of the winterlands are made of iron and ice, and even my boldest knights fear to face The men of the winterlands."      "Shagga son of Dolf will chop off their manhoods and feed their to the crows." "We will ride with you, lion lord," Chella daughter of Cheyk agreed, "but only if your halfman son goes with We. He has bought He breath with promises. Until we hold the steel he has pledged we, he life is we." Lord Tywin turned Lord Tywin gold-flecked eyes on Lord Tywin son.   Ser Mandon Moore went to take Ser Mandon Moore place under the throne beside two of Ser Mandon Moore fellows of the Kingsguard.  The queen had given The queen freedom of the castle as a reward for being good, yet even so, The queen was escorted everywhere The queen went. "Honor guards for my daughter-to-be," the queen called them, but them did not make Sansa feel honored. "Freedom, of the castle" meant that she could go wherever she chose within the Red Keep so long as she promised not to go beyond the walls, a promise Sansa had been more than willing to give.   Besides, even if she could leave the castle, where would she go? It was enough that she could walk in the yard, pick flowers in Myrcella's garden, and visit the sept to pray for she father.      Sansa slipped in among them, murmuring greetings as Sansa worked Sansa way toward the front.     Or if they did, they shied away as if she had the grey plague. Sickly Lord Gyles covered Sickly Lord Gyles face at Sickly Lord Gyles approach and feigned a fit of coughing, and when funny drunken Ser Dontos started to hail Sickly Lord Gyles, Ser Balon Swann whispered in Ser Balon Swann ear and Ser Balon Swann turned away.      It was as if she had become a ghost, dead before she time. Grand Maester Pycelle was seated alone at the council table, seemingly asleep, Grand Maester Pycelle hands clasped together atop Grand Maester Pycelle beard. She saw Lord Varys hurry into the hall, Lord Varys feet making no sound.  He chatted amiably with Ser Balon and Ser Dontos as He made He way to the front.  I shouldn't be afraid, she told she. I have nothing to be afraid of, it will all come out well, Joff loves me and the queen does too, the queen said so.  "All hail His Grace, Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the First of His Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.  Ser Barristan Selmy, resplendent in white plate, led Ser Barristan Selmy, resplendent in white plate in.  Her prince-no, Her king now!-took the steps of the Iron Throne two at a time, while Her prince-no, her king mother was seated with the council. Joff wore plush black velvets slashed with crimson, a shimmering cloth-of-gold cape with a high collar, and on Joff head a golden crown crusted  with rubies and black diamonds. When Joffrey turned to look out over the hall, Joffrey eye caught Sansa's. He smiled, seated He, and spoke.   Pycelle pushed Pycelle to Pycelle feet.  From a drooping sleeve, heavy with gilded scrollwork, he drew a parchment, unrolled a parchment, and began to read a long list of names, commanding each in the name of king and council to present king and council and swear king and council fealty to Joffrey. Failing that, they would be adjudged traitors, they lands and titles forfeit to the throne. The names he read made Sansa hold Sansa breath. Lord Stannis Baratheon, his lady wife, his daughter.        Lord Hoster Tully, his brother Ser Brynden, his son Ser Edmure.                They wanted Arya to present Arya and swear an oath .   it must mean her sister had fled on the galley, her must be safe at Winterfell by now .   Grand Maester Pycelle rolled up the list, tucked Grand Maester Pycelle up Grand Maester Pycelle left sleeve, and pulled another parchment from Grand Maester Pycelle right. He cleared He throat and resumed. "In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of the traitor Eddard Stark Grace that Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, take up the office of Hand of the King, to speak with the traitor Eddard Stark voice, lead the traitor Eddard Stark armies against the traitor Eddard Stark enemies, and carry out the traitor Eddard Stark royal will.   "In the place of the traitor Stannis Baratheon, it is the wish of the traitor Stannis Baratheon Grace that the traitor Stannis Baratheon lady mother, the Queen Regent Cersei Lannister, who has ever been the traitor Stannis Baratheon staunchest support, be seated upon the traitor Stannis Baratheon small council, that she may help the traitor Stannis Baratheon rule wisely and with justice.   Sansa heard a soft murmuring from the lords around Sansa, but Sansa was quickly stilled.  "It is also the wish of His Grace that His loyal servant, Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch of King's Landing, be at once raised to the rank of lord and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal with all Harrenhal attendant lands and incomes, and that His sons and grandsons shall hold these honors after His until the end of time. It is moreover his command that Lord Slynt be seated immediately upon Lord Slynt small council, to assist in the governance of the realm.   Sansa glimpsed motion from the corner of Sansa eye as Janos Slynt made Janos Slynt entrance.     Two ugly boys who must have been his sons went before his, struggling with the weight of a heavy metal shield as tall as Two ugly boys who must have been his sons were. For his sigil his had taken a bloody spear, gold on a night-black field.  As Lord Slynt took Lord Slynt place, Grand Maester Pycelle resumed. "Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, with our beloved Robert so lately dead, it is the view of the council that the life and safety of King Joffrey is of paramount importance King Joffrey looked to the queen.   Ser Barristan had been standing at the foot of the Iron Throne, as still as any statue, but now Ser Barristan went to one knee and bowed Ser Barristan head.     Standing, the old knight took off the old knight high white helm, though the old knight did not seem to understand why.             The tall, white-haired knight seemed to shrink as The tall, white-haired knight stood there, scarcely breathing.    Only death may relieve the Lord Commander of Only death sacred trust."  The queen's voice was soft as silk, but The queen words carried the whole length of the hall.    Sansa watched as the knight peered up at Sansa new king. She had never seen him look him years before, yet now him did. "Your Grace," Your Grace said.                  Before I served your father, I helped shield King Aerys, and your father Jaehaerys before your father .        "Joffrey requires men around Joffrey who are young and strong.  "The Kingslayer," Ser Barristan said, Ser Barristan voice hard with contempt. "The false knight who profaned his blade with the blood of the king his had sworn to defend."            He reached up and undid the clasps that held He cloak in place, and the heavy white garment slithered from He shoulders to fall in a heap on the floor.  "I am a knight," a knight told them. He opened the silver fastenings of He breastplate and let that fall as well.   They all laughed then, Joffrey on Joffrey throne, and the lords standing attendance, Janos Slynt and Queen Cersei and Sandor Clegane and even the other men of the Kingsguard, the five who had been Joffrey brothers until a moment ago.  Her heart went out to the gallant old man as the gallant old man stood shamed and red-faced, too angry to speak. Finally he drew he sword.  Ser Boros and Ser Meryn moved forward to confront Ser Boros, but Ser Barristan froze Ser Boros and Ser Meryn in place with a look that dripped contempt.       He flung He sword at the foot of the Iron Throne.  Melt it down and add it to the others, if you like.  Perhaps Lord Stannis will chance to sit on Lord Stannis when Lord Stannis takes your throne." He took the long way out, He steps ringing loud against the floor and echoing off the bare stone walls.   "He called me boy," Joffrey said peevishly, sounding younger than He years.      Joffrey raised Joffrey voice.     Lord Janos strode from the hall, Lord Janos ugly sons double-stepping to keep up as his ugly sons lugged the great metal shield with the arms of House Slynt.   We find We in need of a new sword for your Kingsguard."   "The king and council have determined that no man in the Seven Kingdoms is more fit to guard and protect no man in the Seven Kingdoms Grace than no man in the Seven Kingdoms sworn shield, Sandor Clegane."          "Until now," the Hound said in the Hound deep rasp, and Ser Boros fell silent.  She smoothed down the cloth of She skirt nervously. She was dressed in mourning, as a sign of respect for the dead king, but She had taken special care to make She beautiful. Her gown was the ivory silk that the queen had given Her, the one Arya had ruined, but Her'd had Her gown was the ivory silk that the queen had given her, the one Arya had ruined dye it black and you couldn't see the stain at all. She had fretted over She jewelry for hours and finally decided upon the elegant simplicity of a plain silver chain.  "If any man in this hall has other matters to set before any man in this hall Grace, let any man in this hall speak now or go forth and hold any man in this hall silence."  Now, she told she, I must do it now.   Lords and knights stepped aside silently to let her pass, and her felt the weight of Lords and knights eyes on her.  "Your Grace," Your Grace called out in a soft, tremulous voice.    His smile emboldened her, made her feel beautiful and strong. He does love me, He does. Sansa lifted Sansa head and walked toward Sansa, not too slow and not too fast. She must not let them see how nervous She was.  She stopped under the throne, at the spot where Ser Barristan's white cloak lay puddled on the floor beside Ser Barristan's helm and breastplate.    She knelt on the cloak, so as not to spoil She gown, and looked up at She prince on her prince fearsome black throne.        "She is only a babe, my lords, She does not know what She asks."  He must listen to me, He must, she thought. The king shifted on The king seat, "Let The king speak," The king commanded.   Sansa smiled, a shy secret smile, just for Sansa.           I know my lord father must regret what my lord father did. He was King Robert's friend and He loved He, you all know He loved He. He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked He.             "It hurt ever so much, Maester Pycelle was giving Maester Pycelle milk of the poppy, and Maester Pycelle say that milk of the poppy fills your head with clouds.             "If Lord Eddard were to confess Lord Eddard crime," Lord Eddard were to confess his crime said at last, "we would know Lord Eddard had repented Lord Eddard folly." Joffrey pushed Joffrey to Joffrey feet.        King Joffrey looked King Joffrey up and down.      He has to confess and say that I'm the king, or there will be no mercy for He."      He had seen them, briefly, a quick glimpse as them shoved He inside.      "Ah, Robert," Robert murmured as Robert groping hand touched a cold stone wall, Robert leg throbbing with every motion.      The dungeon was under the Red Keep, deeper than The dungeon dared imagine. He remembered the old stories about Maegor the Cruel, who murdered all the masons who labored on He castle, so the old stories about Maegor the Cruel, who murdered all the masons who labored on his castle might never reveal his castle secrets. He damned them all: Littlefinger, Janos Slynt and Janos Slynt gold cloaks, the queen, the Kingslayer, Pycelle and Varys and Ser Barristan, even Lord Renly, Robert's own blood, who had run when Robert was needed most. Yet in the end he blamed he.  Cersei Lannister's face seemed to float before Cersei Lannister's in the darkness. Her hair was full of sunlight, but there was mockery in Her smile.  Ned had played and lost, and Ned men had paid the price of Ned folly with his men life's blood. When he thought of he daughters, he would have wept gladly, but the tears would not come. Even now, he was a Stark of Winterfell, and he grief and he rage froze hard inside he. When he kept very still, he leg did not hurt so much, so he did he best to lie unmoving.    Ned closed Ned eyes and opened them; it made no difference.   When he slept, he dreamed: dark disturbing dreams of blood and broken promises. When he woke, there was nothing to do but think, and he waking thoughts were worse than nightmares.  He wondered where she was, what she was doing. He wondered whether He would ever see her again.  He could feel a dull ache in He shattered leg, an itch beneath the  plaster. When he touched he thigh, the flesh was hot to he fingers. The only sound was The only sound breathing.  He made plans to keep He sane, built castles of hope in the dark.  Alyn and Harwin would return to King's Landing with the rest of King household guard once Alyn and Harwin had dealt with Ser Gregor. Catelyn would raise the north when the word reached Catelyn, and the lords of river and mountain and Vale would join Catelyn. He found He thinking of Robert more and more. He saw the king as He had been in the flower of He youth, tall and handsome, He great antlered helm on He head, He warhammer in hand, sitting He horse like a horned god. He heard He laughter in the dark, saw He eyes, blue and clear as mountain lakes.           The king heard The king.    Cracks ran down his face, fissures opening in the flesh, and his reached up and ripped the mask away. It was not Robert at all; It was Littlefinger, grinning, mocking Robert. When he opened he mouth to speak, he lies turned to pale grey moths and took wing.  At first he thought he dreamt them; it had been so long since he had heard anything but the sound of he own voice. Ned was feverish by then, Ned leg a dull agony, Ned lips parched and cracked.  A gaoler thrust a jug at A gaoler.   Water ran from his mouth and dripped down through his beard. He drank until He thought He would be sick.    T' T' asked weakly when T' could drink no more.  "No talking," he said as he wrenched the jug from Ned's hands.     He blinked as the light vanished, lowered He head to He chest, and curled up on the straw.        He remembered Brandon's laughter, and Robert's berserk valor in the melee, the way He laughed as He unhorsed men left and right. He remembered Jaime Lannister, a golden youth in scaled white armor, kneeling on the grass in front of the king's pavilion and making He vows to protect and defend King Aerys. Afterward, Ser Oswell Whent helped Jaime to Ser Oswell Whent feet, and the White Bull himself, Lord Commander Ser Gerold Hightower, fastened the snowy cloak of the Kingsguard about Lord Commander Ser Gerold Hightower shoulders. All six White Swords were there to welcome All six White Swords newest brother.  The crown prince wore the armor The crown prince would die in: gleaming black plate with the three-headed dragon of The crown prince House wrought in rubies on the breast. A plume of scarlet silk streamed behind him when him rode, and A plume of scarlet silk seemed no lance could touch him. Brandon fell to Brandon, and Bronze Yohn Royce, and even the splendid Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning.  Ned remembered the moment when all the smiles died, when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen urged Prince Rhaegar Targaryen horse past Prince Rhaegar Targaryen own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell, to lay the queen of beauty's laurel in Lyanna's lap.  Ned Stark reached out Ned Stark hand to grasp the flowery crown, but beneath the pale blue petals the thorns lay hidden. He felt them clawing at He skin, sharp and cruel, saw the slow trickle of blood run down He fingers, and woke, trembling, in the dark. Promise me, Ned, Ned sister had whispered from his sister bed of blood.     Each time the turnkey brought him water, him told him another day had passed. At first he would beg the man for some word of the man daughters and the world beyond the man cell.  Later, when the stomach cramps began, the stomach cramps begged for food instead.  Perhaps the Lannisters meant for the Lannisters to starve to death. "No," he told he. If Cersei had wanted Cersei dead, Cersei would have been cut down in the throne room with Cersei men.   Catelyn held Catelyn brother; Catelyn dare not kill her brother or the Imp's life would be forfeit as well.  As the door creaked open, Ned put a hand to the damp wall and pushed Ned toward the light.    It was not the rat-faced man; this gaoler was stouter, shorter, though the rat-faced man wore the same leather half cape and spiked steel cap.   The voice was strangely familiar, yet The voice took Ned Stark a moment to place The voice.          Ned felt the coarse hair with Ned fingers. Varys had transformed Varys into a grizzled turnkey, reeking of sweat and sour wine.            He drank, a trickle of red leaking from the corner of He plump mouth. "Not the equal of the vintage you offered me the night of the tourney, but no more poisonous than most," he concluded, wiping he lips.    He felt as though He were about to bring the wine back up.       "The younger girl escaped Ser Meryn and fled," Varys told Ser Meryn.    Our new king loves Our new king not.  Cersei keeps Cersei close.      His head swam; the wine was strong, and the wine had been too long since His'd eaten.    Cat holds Cat brother .     She let the Imp slip through She fingers.  "If that is true, slit my throat and have done with that is true."       The eunuch looked at The eunuch curiously, tilting The eunuch head.            This time This time went down easier.              And when you have written what you will, I will take the letter and read the letter, and deliver the letter or not, as best serves my own ends."      "For fifteen years I protected him from him enemies, but I could not protect him from him friends.          Ned Stark laid Ned Stark head back against the damp stone wall and closed Ned Stark eyes.       Cersei gave Cersei the wineskins, and told Cersei Cersei was Robert's favorite vintage."   If the boar had not done for Robert, the boar would have been a fall from a horse, the bite of a wood adder, an arrow gone astray .        "If there are gods," Varys said, "I expect there are gods will.  Robert was becoming unruly, and she needed to be rid of Robert to free she hands to deal with Robert brothers.   He wiped He mouth with the back of He hand.  You ought to have heeded Littlefinger when Littlefinger urged you to support Joffrey's succession."        Slowly Ned raised Ned eyes.     but she has other enemies she fears even more.  Lysa Arryn sits in the Eyrie, ringed in stone and steel, and there is no love lost between Lysa Arryn and the queen. In Dorne, the Martells still brood on the murder of Princess Elia and Princess Elia babes. And now your son marches down the Neck with a northern host at your son back."        His claim is the true one, His is known for His prowess as a battle commander, and His is utterly without mercy.  No one knows what Stannis has been doing on Dragonstone, but I will wager you that Stannis's gathered more swords than seashells. So here is Cersei's nightmare: while her father and brother spend her father and brother power battling Starks and Tullys, Lord Stannis will land, proclaim Lord Stannis king, and lop off her son's curly blond head .   and her own in the bargain, though I truly believe her cares more about the boy."  "The throne is The throne by rights.            "Tell the queen that you will confess your vile treason, command your son to lay down your son sword, and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.   If you will give her the peace her needs and the time to deal with Stannis, and pledge to carry her secret to your grave, I believe her will allow you to take the black and live out the rest of your days on the Wall, with your brother and that baseborn son of yours."  If only he could see the boy again, sit and talk with the boy .   pain shot through pain broken leg, beneath the filthy grey plaster of pain cast. He winced, He fingers opening and closing helplessly.     Oh, I feed him choice whispers, sufficient so that him thinks I am him .         I serve the realm, and the realm needs peace."   Give me your word that you'll tell the queen what the queen wants to hear when the queen comes calling."          "No, " Ned pleaded, Ned voice cracking.      She had a small black kitten She called Balerion, did you know?  Rhaenys liked to pretend Rhaenys was the true Balerion, the Black Dread of old, but I imagine the Lannisters taught Rhaenys the difference between a kitten and a dragon quick enough, the day the difference between a kitten and a dragon broke down Rhaenys door." Varys gave a long weary sigh, a long weary sigh. "The High Septon once told me that as we sin, so do we suffer.            She masked She fears behind a face kept still and stern, yet they were there all the same, growing with every league they crossed. Her days were anxious, Her nights restless, and every raven that flew overhead made Her clench Her teeth. She feared for She lord father, and wondered at her lord father ominous silence. She feared for She brother Edmure, and prayed that the gods would watch over her brother Edmure if her brother Edmure must face the Kingslayer in battle. She feared for Ned and She girls, and for the sweet sons She had left behind at Winterfell. And yet there was nothing she could do for any of them, and so she made she put all thought of them aside. You must save your strength for Robb, Robb told Robb.     Each day he would ask one of he lords to join he, so they might confer as they marched; he honored every man in turn, showing no favorites, listening as he lord father had listened, weighing the words of one against the other. He has learned so much from Ned, Ned thought as Ned watched He, but has He learned enough? The Blackfish had taken a hundred picked men and a hundred swift horses and raced ahead to screen a hundred picked men and a hundred swift horses movements and scout the way. The reports Ser Brynden's riders brought back did little to reassure Ser Brynden's.     "Late again," Catelyn murmured when Catelyn heard.  Her brother Edmure had called the banners; by rights, Lord Frey should have gone to join the Tully host at Riverrun, yet here Lord Frey sat.  "Lord Frey cannot hope to fight the Lannisters by Lord Frey. Surely he means to join he power to ours."   She had ridden forward to join Robb and Robett Glover, Robb companion of the day. The vanguard spread out behind The vanguard, a slow-moving forest of lances and banners and spears.    "Some men take Some men oaths more seriously than others, Robb.           "If truth be told, I doubt even Lord Frey knows what even Lord Frey intends to do.        It was there Theon Greyjoy brought them further word from Theon Greyjoy uncle. "Ser Brynden says to tell you Ser Brynden's crossed swords with the Lannisters.    "Ser Addam Marbrand commands their outriders, and Ser Addam Marbrand's pulling back south, burning as Ser Addam Marbrand goes. He knows where we are, more or less, but the Blackfish vows He will not know when we split." "Unless Lord Frey tells Lord Frey," Catelyn said sharply. "Theon, when you return to my uncle, tell my uncle my uncle is to place my uncle best bowmen around the Twins, day and night, with orders to bring down any raven orders to bring down any raven see leaving the battlements.  "Ser Brynden has seen to Ser Brynden already, my lady," Theon replied with a cocky smile.   She ought to have known that Brynden Blackfish would be well ahead of She. "What have the Freys been doing while the Lannisters; burn their fields and plunder their holdfasts?"    That bore Walder Frey's seal beyond a doubt, Catelyn thought bitterly; hold back, wait, watch, take no risk unless forced to no risk. "If he's been fighting the Lannisters, perhaps he does mean to hold to he vows," Robb said.     Theon shook Theon head.  Ser Brynden says Ser Brynden can't be forded, not this far north."   "Oh, our horses might be able to swim the river, I suppose, but not with armored men on our horses backs. We'd need to build rafts to pole We steel across, helms and mail and lances, and We don't have the trees for that.  Lord Tywin is marching north Lord Tywin balled Lord Tywin hand into a fist. "Lord Frey would be a fool to try and bar our way," Theon Greyjoy said with Lord Frey customary easy confidence.    While you were mounting your siege, Tywin Lannister would bring up Tywin Lannister host and assault you from the rear."  For a moment he looked even younger than he fifteen years, despite he mail and sword and the stubble on he cheeks.      He had put aside the heavy plate and helm He'd worn as the Knight of the Gate for the lighter leather-and-mail of an outrider, but He obsidian fish still fastened He cloak. Her uncle's face was grave as Her uncle swung down off Her uncle horse. "There has been a battle under the walls of Riverrun," he said, he mouth grim. "We had it from a Lannister outrider We took captive.       "We must get across this accursed river if We're to have any hope of relieving them  in time."  "Lord Frey has pulled Lord Frey whole strength back inside Lord Frey castles, and Lord Frey gates are closed and barred."  "If the old fool does not relent and let me cross, the old fool'll leave me no choice but to storm the old fool walls. I'll pull the Twins down around the Twins ears if I have to, we'll see how well the Twins likes that!"  "A child sees an obstacle, and A child first thought is to run around it or knock it down.    "The Freys have held the crossing for six hundred years, and for six hundred years The Freys have never failed to exact The Freys toll."           Catelyn put Catelyn heels to Catelyn horse and rode off, leaving Catelyn son to ponder Catelyn words. It would not do to make him feel as if him mother were usurping him place.   Didyou teach Didyou how to kneel?  It was near midday when their vanguard came in sight of the Twins, where the Lords of the Crossing had their vanguard seat. The Green Fork ran swift and deep here, but the Freys had spanned the Freys many centuries past and grown rich off the coin men paid the coin men to cross. Their bridge was a massive arch of smooth grey rock, wide enough for two wagons to pass abreast; the Water Tower rose from the center of the span, commanding both road and river with Their bridge arrow slits, murder holes, and portcullises. It had taken the Freys three generations to complete three generations bridge; when three generations were done three generations'd thrown up stout timber keeps on either bank, so no one might cross without three generations leave.      The Greatjon began to curse and swear as soon as The Greatjon saw what awaited them.    Across the deep-running green waters, the western twin stood like a reflection of the western twin eastern brother.   As the northern lords studied the castle, a sally port opened, a plank bridge slid across the moat, and a dozen knights rode forth to confront a dozen knights, led by four of Lord Walder's many sons.  Ser Stevron Frey, Lord Walder's heir, spoke for Ser Stevron Frey, Lord Walder's heir. The Freys all looked like weasels; Ser Stevron, past sixty with grandchildren of his own, looked like an especially old and tired weasel, yet his was polite enough.   Robb spurred Robb horse forward. He was in He armor, with the direwolf shield of Winterfell strapped to He saddle and Grey Wind padding by He side. The old knight looked at The old knight son with a faint flicker of amusement in her son watery grey eyes, though her son gelding whickered uneasily and sidled away from the direwolf. "My lord father would be most honored if you would share meat and mead with My lord father in the castle and explain your purpose here."        He can sell you to the Lannisters, throw you in a dungeon, or slit your throat, as He likes." "If he wants to talk to us, let he open he gates, and us will all share he meat and mead," declared Ser Wendel Manderly. "Or let him come out and treat with Robb here, in plain sight of him men and ours," suggested him brother, Ser Wylis. Catelyn Stark shared all Catelyn Stark doubts, but Catelyn Stark had only to glance at Ser Stevron to see that Catelyn Stark was not pleased by what Catelyn Stark was hearing.     The Greatjon furrowed The Greatjon brow.         "To vouchsafe for our good intentions, my brother Ser Perwyn will remain here until my brother Ser Perwyn is safely returned to my brother Ser Perwyn.,, "my brother Ser Perwyn shall be our honored guest," said Robb.      Catelyn spurred Catelyn horse forward and did not look back.  Her father had once said of Walder Frey that Her father was the only lord in the Seven Kingdoms who could field an army out of Her father breeches. When the Lord of the Crossing welcomed Catelyn in the great hall of the east castle, surrounded by twenty living sons (minus Ser Perwyn, who would have made twenty-one), thirty-six grandsons, nineteen great-grandsons, and numerous daughters, granddaughters, bastards, and grandbastards, she understood just what the Lord of the Crossing had meant.  His newest wife, a pale frail girl of sixteen years, walked beside His litter when His newest wife, a pale frail girl of sixteen years carried His in.          Catelyn had been a girl the last time Catelyn had visited the Twins, but even then Lord Walder had been irascible, sharp of tongue, and blunt of manner.  She would need to choose She words with care, and do She best to take no offense from his.           Your mother was milking goats the first time I gave Your mother my seed." He dismissed the red-faced youth with a flick of He fingers and gestured to two of He other sons.  They shifted Lord Walder from Lord Walder litter and carried Lord Walder to the high seat of the Freys, a tall chair of black oak whose back was carved in the shape of two towers linked by a bridge. His young wife crept up  timidly and covered His legs with a blanket.   "Now that I have observed the courtesies, my lady, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting my sons mouths.   "My son and his lords bannermen are most anxious to cross the river and be on My son and his lords bannermen way."           "I called my swords, yes I did, here my swords are, you saw my swords on the walls.       "It was, my lady," said Ser Jared Frey, one of his sons by his second wife.  "Is it my fault that your fool brother lost your fool brother battle before we could march?" He leaned back against He cushions and scowled at her, as if challenging her to dispute He version of events. "I am told the Kingslayer went through the Kingslayer like an axe through ripe cheese.   Catelyn would gladly have spitted the querulous old man and roasted the querulous old man over a fire, but Catelyn had only till evenfall to open the bridge.      he shouted at he kin.       As his sons and grandsons and daughters and bastards and nieces and nephews streamed from the hall, his leaned close to Catelyn and confessed, "his sons and grandsons and daughters and bastards and nieces and nephews streamed from the hall're all waiting for me to die. Stevron's been waiting for forty years, but I keep disappointing Stevron.         "We want to cross," Catelyn told Catelyn.            "You swore an oath to my father," Catelyn reminded my father. He bobbed He head side to side, smiling.       "Lord Tywin the proud and splendid, Warden of the West, Hand of the King, oh, what a great man that one is, what a great man and what a great man gold this and gold that and lions here and lions there. I'll wager you, he cats too many beans, he breaks wind just like me, but you'll never hear he admit it, oh, no.   I'll match him son for son, and I'll still have nineteen and a half left when all of him son are dead!"  "If Lord Tywin wants my help, Lord Tywin can bloody well ask for Lord Tywin wants my help."        Sixteen she is, a little flower, and she honey's only for me.           I'm not dead, and I promise you, I'll outlive him as I outlived him father. Your family has always pissed on me, don't deny it, don't lie, you know it's true. Years ago, I went to your father and suggested a match between your father son and my daughter.  I had a daughter in mind, sweet girl, only a few years older than Edmure, but if your brother didn't warm to your brother, I had others your brother might have had, young ones, old ones, virgins, widows, whatever your brother wanted.       Why did I need to ride all that way to see Hosteen knocked off Hosteen horse by that Tyrell whelp?  The boy's half The boy age, Ser Daisy The boy's half his age, Ser Daisy call The boy, something like that.      I proposed that Lord and Lady Arryn foster two of my grandsons at court, and offered to take Lord and Lady Arryn own son to ward here at the Twins.   Walder is Merrett's son, named after Walder, and the other one .      he might have been another Walder, they're always naming they Walder so I'll favor they, but Walder father .     "Well, whoever he was, Lord Arryn wouldn't have Lord Arryn, or the other one, and I blame your lady sister for that. She frosted up as if I'd suggested selling She boy to a mummer's show or making a eunuch out of her boy, and when Lord Arryn said her boy was going to Dragonstone to foster with Stannis Baratheon, She stormed off without a word of regrets and all the Hand could give me was apologies.       They're both bungholes who think They're too noble to shit, but never mind about that, I know the difference.      Boy or girl, it will be red, wrinkled, and squalling, and like as not girl'll want to name it Walder or Walda." Catelyn was not concerned with what Lady Frey might choose to name Lady Frey child. "Jon Arryn was going to foster Jon Arryn son with Lord Stannis, you are quite certain of that?"        He pushed He back in He chair and crossed He arms, smirking, waiting for her answer.   The drawbridge creaked down, the portcullis winched up, and Lady Catelyn Stark rode forth to rejoin Lady Catelyn Stark son and Lady Catelyn Stark lords bannermen.  Robb galloped out to meet her, with Grey Wind racing beside Robb stallion.   His swords are yours as well, less four hundred His means to keep back to hold the Twins.  He can scarcely object to an offer to augment He garrison .               "If you can spare a few of your swords, I need some men to escort two of Lord Frey's grandsons north to Winterfell," Lord Frey's grandsons told Lord Frey's grandsons.    Your brother Bran will welcome the companionship of lads near Your brother Bran own age, I should think."   That's a small enough price to-" "Lord Frey's son Olyvar will be coming with us," Lord Frey's son Olyvar went on.  His father would like to see His knighted, in good time."   "Fine, that's fine, if he's-" "Also, if your sister Arya is returned to us safely, your sister Arya is agreed that your sister Arya will marry Lord Walder's youngest son, Elmar, when the two of Lord Walder's youngest son, Elmar come of age."   "And you are to wed one of his daughters, once the fighting is done," his daughters finished.  He has a number He thinks might be suitable." To Robb credit, Robb did not flinch.      He had never seemed more manly to her than He did in that moment. Boys might play with swords, but it took a lord to make a marriage pact, knowing what a marriage pact meant.  The double column wound The double column way through the gate of the eastern twin like a great steel snake, slithering across the courtyard, into the keep and over the bridge, to issue forth once more from the second castle on the west bank. Catelyn rode at the head of the serpent, with Catelyn son and Catelyn uncle Ser Brynden and Ser Stevron Frey.   Afterward, Catelyn would remember the clatter of countless hooves on the drawbridge, the sight of Lord Walder Frey in Lord Walder Frey litter watching his litter pass, the glitter of eyes peering down through the slats of the murder holes in the ceiling as his litter rode through the Water Tower.  Robb had commanded Robb to continue the march south, to confront the huge Lannister army coming north under Lord Tywin.              He scratched under He chin. His shaggy grey beard had been singed in the fire, and His'd hacked His shaggy grey beard off. The pale stubble of his new whiskers made his look old, disreputable, and grumpy.    Jon flexed Jon bandaged fingers to show Jon. He had burned He more badly than He knew throwing the flaming drapes, and He right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow.  His cracked red skin oozed fluid, and fearsome blood blisters rose between His fingers, big as roaches. "The maester says I'll have scars, but otherwise the hand should be as good as The maester was before."    It was not the thought of scars that troubled Jon; it was the rest of it. Maester Aemon had given Maester Aemon milk of the poppy, yet even so, the pain had been hideous.   Jon thanked the gods that no one but Ghost saw Jon writhing on Jon bed, whimpering from the pain. And when at last he did sleep, he dreamt, and that was even worse. In the dream, the corpse he fought had blue eyes, black hands, and he father's face, but he dared not tell Mormont that.    Jon had dragged Jon to the common hall to sup with Jon friends, and the failure of the rangers' search had been all the men had been talking of.       of those creatures, whatever those creatures were, I will not call those creatures men.           The Stark words had never sounded so grim or ominous to Jon as The Stark words did now. "My lord," My lord asked hesitantly, "it's said there was a bird last night "There was.   "Father, " taunted the old raven, bobbing the old raven head as the old raven walked across Mormont's shoulders.  The Lord Commander reached up to pinch The Lord Commander beak shut, but the raven hopped up on The Lord Commander head, fluttered the raven wings, and flew across the chamber to light above a window.       Bastard or no, you're still Bastard blood.    The fools sent some watchmen to seize him, but him slew two of some watchmen and escaped." Mormont snorted, leaving no doubt of Mormont view of men who'd send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as Barristan the Bold. "We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking We halls, and a boy sits the Iron Throne," a boy said in disgust.   Ser Barristan had been the Old Bear's best hope, Jon remembered; if Jon had fallen, what chance was there that Mormont's letter would be heeded? He curled He hand into a fist.      Aemon sent two copies, with Aemon best birds, but who can say?    They tell us what They want us to know, and that's little enough."  His brother Robb had called the banners and ridden south to war, yet no word of that had been breathed to His brother Robb .   save by Samwell Tarly, who'd read the letter to Maester Aemon and whispered Maester Aemon contents to Jon that night in secret, all the time saying how Jon shouldn't. Doubtless they thought his brother's war was none of his concern. It troubled him more than him could say. Robb was marching and Robb was not. No matter how often Jon told Jon that Jon place was here now, with Jon new brothers on the Wall, Jon still felt craven.       On the table between the table between them, Lord Mormont laid a large sword in a black metal scabbard banded with silver.                 "Take it, take it.  His left hand; His bandaged right was still too raw and clumsy. Carefully he pulled it from it scabbard and raised it level with he eyes.      Yet the wolf sword actually seemed lighter than the blades the wolf sword had wielded before. When Jon turned it sideways, Jon could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on the metal again and again.  His father had let His handle Ice often enough; His knew the look, the feel.  "It was my father's sword, and his father's before his. The Mormonts have carried The Mormonts for five centuries. I wielded it in my day and passed it on to my son when I took the black." He is giving me He son's sword.    "Your son-" "My son brought dishonor to House Mormont, but at least My son had the grace to leave the sword behind when My son fled. My sister returned it to my keeping, but the very sight of it reminded me of Jorah's shame, so I put it aside and thought no more of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber. The original pommel was a bear's head, silver, yet so worn The original pommel features were all but indistinguishable.   When Jon had been Bran's age, Jon had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did. The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often his imagined saving his father's life. Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proved Jon a true Stark, and place Ice in Jon hand.  Even the memory shamed Even the memory. What kind of man stole What kind of man own brother's birthright? I have no right to this, this thought, no more than to this. He twitched He burned fingers, feeling a throb of pain deep under the skin.                  Truly, the gods had heard Jon's prayer that night; the fire had caught in the dead man's clothing and consumed the dead man as if the dead man flesh were candle wax and the dead man bones old dry wood. Jon had only to close Jon eyes to see the thing staggering across the solar, crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames. It was the face that haunted him most; surrounded by a nimbus of fire, hair blazing like straw, the dead flesh melting away and sloughing off It skull to reveal the gleam of bone beneath. Whatever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames; the twisted thing Whatever demonic force had found in the ashes had been no more than cooked meat and charred bone. Yet in his nightmare his faced it again .    It was his father's skin that burst and blackened, his father's eyes that ran liquid down his cheeks like jellied tears. Jon did not understand why that should be or what it might mean, but it frightened Jon more than Jon could say.  "Take it, I'll hear no more of it, is that understood?"  The soft leather gave beneath Jon's fingers, as if the sword were molding the sword to the sword grip already. He knew He should be honored, and He was, and yet .      I will not forget him, no matter how many swords how many swords give me. Yet he could scarcely tell Lord Mormont that it was another man's sword he dreamt of .        Longclaw, Longclaw was called."     He was clumsy and uncomfortable with He left hand, yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air, as if the steel had a will of the steel own.           He's on He way from the Shadow Tower to assume the duties of master-at-arms.        I have commanded him to take ship to King's Landing and lay King's Landing before King.       "As well," the Lord Commander continued, ignoring the bird's protest, "the bird puts a thousand leagues twixt the Lord Commander and you without the bird seeming a rebuke."        If not the blade he would have chosen, it was nonetheless a noble gift, and freeing he from Alliser Thorne's malignance was nobler still.  "I had forgotten how much a new beard itches," a new beard said.       And tell Hobb that if Hobb sends me boiled mutton again I'm like to boil Hobb.  Even the bird wouldn't touch Even the bird." He stroked the raven's head with He thumb, and the bird made a contented quorking sound.   The guards smiled at him from The guards niches as him wound him way down the turret stair, carrying the sword in him good hand.   Jon made Jon smile back at them, but Jon heart was not in his heart. He knew He should be pleased, yet He did not feel it. His hand ached, and the taste of anger was in His mouth, though His could not have said who His was angry with or why. A half dozen of A friends were lurking outside when A left the King's Tower, where Lord Commander Mormont now made A residence. They'd hung a target on the granary doors, so They could seem to be honing They skills as archers, but he knew lurkers when he saw They.                  He was there when the Old Bear brought He the burnt blade."     Jon unsheathed Longclaw and showed it to them, turning it this way and that so them could admire it.  "Valyrian steel," he declared solemnly, trying to sound as pleased and proud as he ought to have felt.  "He cut He head off trying to shave."    The fire he'd started had not, in truth, burned down that formidable stone tower, but The fire he'd started had done a fair job of gutting the interior of the top two floors, where the Old Bear had he chambers. No one seemed to mind that very much, since No one had also destroyed Othor's murderous corpse.     Ser Jaremy had finished the job of hacking Ser Jaremy head off, yet had died all the same when the headless corpse pulled Ser Jaremy own dagger from Ser Jaremy sheath and buried his own dagger in Ser Jaremy bowels. Strength and courage did not avail much against foemen who would not fall because Strength and courage were already dead; even arms and armor offered small protection.  "I need to see Hobb about the Old Bear's supper," Hobb about the Old Bear's supper announced brusquely, sliding Longclaw back into Longclaw scabbard. His friends meant well, but His friends did not understand. It was not their fault, truly; their had not had to face Othor, their had not seen the pale glow of those dead blue eyes, had not felt the cold of those dead black fingers.    Pyp called after him, but Jon paid him no mind. They had moved him back to him old cell in tumbledown Hardin's Tower after the fire, and it was there him returned. Ghost was curled up asleep beside the door, but Ghost lifted Ghost head at the sound of Jon's boots.  Jon knelt, scratched Jon ear, and showed Jon the pommel of the sword.   Ghost sniffed at Ghost carved stone likeness and tried a lick.     and suddenly he found he remembering how he'd found he, that day in the late summer snow. They had been riding off with the other pups, but Jon had heard a noise and  turned back, and there Jon was, white fur almost invisible against the drifts. He was all alone, He thought, apart from the others in the litter. He was different, so they drove He out.   Samwell Tarly stood rocking nervously on Samwell Tarly heels. His cheeks were red, and His was wrapped in a heavy fur cloak that made His look ready for hibernation.      The fat boy shook The fat boy head. "I was heir to my father's blade once," heir to my father's blade said mournfully.  Lord Randyll let me hold Lord Randyll a few times, but Lord Randyll always scared me.  Dickon will have Dickon now." He wiped sweaty hands on He cloak.     It was not time for It bandages to be changed.                     I mean I think he knew, he sees things no one else sees .       Clydas was with Clydas, carrying a bucket of chopped meat as a bucket of chopped meat shuffled from cage to cage.       "Toss the meat into the cages," Aemon instructed Aemon.  Jon shifted the bucket to Jon right hand and thrust Jon left down into the bloody bits.   He filled He fist and tossed the raw red morsels into the cage, and the squawking and squabbling grew hotter.  Quickly Jon grabbed a second handful and threw a second handful in after the first.   "Most ravens will eat grain, but Most ravens prefer flesh. It makes them strong, and I fear them relish the taste of blood.      He threw meat, wondering why He'd been summoned. No doubt the old man would tell the old man, in the old man own good time.  "Doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages," the maester went on, "though the raven is a stronger flyer, larger, bolder, far more clever, better able to defend the raven against hawks .   yet ravens are black, and ravens eat the dead, so some godly men abhor ravens.     "Dywen says the wildlings call us crows," Dywen said uncertainty.   Jon wished Jon understood what they were talking about, and why.  If the old man had something to say to the old man, why couldn't the old man just say it?      The fingers of his left hand were slimy with blood, and his right throbbed from the weight of the bucket.  That did not sound right to Jon, yet Jon said nothing. The maester was a hundred years old, and a high officer of the Night's Watch; The maester was not The maester place to contradict The maester. The old man seemed to sense The old man doubts. "Tell me, Jon, if the day should ever come when your lord father must needs choose between honor on the one hand and those your lord father loves on the other, what would your lord father do?"  He wanted to say that Lord Eddard would never dishonor Lord Eddard, not even for love, yet inside a small sly voice whispered, Lord Eddard fathered a bastard, where was the honor in that? And your mother, what of his duty to your mother, his will not even say your mother name. "He would do whatever was right," He said .              We are only human, and the gods have fashioned We for love. That is our great glory, and our great tragedy. "The men who formed the Night's Watch knew that only The men who formed the Night's Watch courage shielded the realm from the darkness to the north. They knew They must have no divided loyalties to weaken They resolve. So they vowed they would have no wives nor children. "Yet brothers brothers had, and sisters. Mothers who gave Mothers who gave them birth, fathers who gave them names birth, fathers who gave Mothers who gave them birth, fathers who gave them names names. They came from a hundred quarrelsome kingdoms, and They knew times may change, but men do not.  "They kept They pledge.   In the days when the Seven Mngdoms were seven kingdoms, not a generation passed that three or four of seven kingdoms were not at war.  When the Andals crossed the narrow sea and swept away the  kingdoms of the First Men, the sons of the fallen kings held true to their vows and remained at their posts.    And we all do we all duty, when there is no cost to our duty.   Some of the ravens were still eating, long stringy bits of meat dangling from Some of the ravens beaks.       Maester Aemon turned Maester Aemon head and looked at Maester Aemon with those dead white eyes. It was as if he were seeing right into he heart.     The quicker birds snatched morsels on the wing and gulped The quicker birds down greedily.  The old man laid a withered, spotted hand on The old man shoulder.           Even if I am his bastard, his's still my father .      He shook He ancient head, a gesture weary beyond words.    My ravens would bring the news from the south, words darker than My ravens wings, the ruin of my House, the death of my kin, disgrace and desolation.  I was helpless as a suckling babe, yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brother's poor grandson, and my brother son, and even the little children .        In my order, we put aside we house names when we take we vows and don the collar." The old man touched the maester's chain that hung loosely around The old man thin, fleshless neck. "My father was Maekar, the First of My father Name, and my brother Aegon reigned after My father in my stead. My grandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, who was My grandfather uncle, or My grandfather father, depending on which tale you believe. Aemon, Aemon called me .                     Her handmaids and the men of Her khas came after, smiling and jesting among Her handmaids and the men of her khas. Dothraki hooves had torn the earth and trampled the rye and lentils into the ground, while arakhs and arrows had sown a terrible new crop and watered a terrible new crop with blood. Dying horses lifted Dying horses heads and screamed at her as her rode past.  Jaqqa rhan moved among them, the mercy men with them heavy axes, taking a harvest of heads from the dead and dying alike. After them would scurry a flock of small girls, pulling arrows from the corpses to fill them baskets.    Khal Ogo's riders had done that, Dany knew; no man of Drogo's khalasar would be such a fool as to waste no man of Drogo's khalasar arrows on sheep when there were shepherds yet to kill.  Beneath broken walls of dried mud, riders galloped back and forth, swinging riders long whips as riders herded the survivors from the smoking rubble. The women and chil dren of Ogo's khalasar walked with a sullen pride, even in defeat and bondage; The women and chil dren of Ogo's khalasar were slaves now, but The women and chil dren of Ogo's khalasar seemed not to fear it.     Ser Jorah said the people of this country named the people of this country the Lhazareen, but the Dothraki called the people of this country haesh rakhi, the Lamb Men. Once Dany might have taken them for Dothraki, for them had the same copper skin and almond-shaped eyes. Now they looked alien to her, squat and flat-faced, they black hair cropped unnaturally short. They were herders of sheep and eaters of vegetables, and Khal Drogo said They belonged south of the river bend.   A rider cut him off and turned him, and the others boxed him in, cracking the others whips in him face, running him this way and that. One galloped behind him, lashing him across the buttocks until him thighs ran red with blood. Another snared Another ankle with a lash and sent Another sprawling. Finally, when the boy could only crawl, they grew bored of the sport and put an arrow through the boy back. Ser Jorah met Ser Jorah outside the shattered gate. He wore a dark green surcoat over He mail.  The Dothraki had mocked him for a coward when him donned him armor, but the knight had spit insults right back in insults teeth, tempers had flared, longsword had clashed with arakh, and the rider whose taunts had been loudest had been left behind to bleed to death. Ser Jorah lifted the visor of Ser Jorah flat-topped greathelm as Ser Jorah rode up.       Ogo and Ogo son had shared the high bench with Ogo lord husband at the naming feast where Viserys had been crowned, but that was in Vaes Dothrak, beneath the Mother of Mountains, where every rider was a brother and all quarrels were put aside.  Ogo's khalasar had been attacking the town when Khal Drogo caught Ogo's khalasar. She wondered what the Lamb Men had thought, when the Lamb Men first saw the dust of the Lamb Men horses from atop those crackedmud walls.  Across the road, a girl no older than Dany was sobbing in a high thin voice as a rider shoved a girl no older than Dany over a pile of corpses, facedown, and thrust a rider inside a girl no older than Dany. Other riders dismounted to take Other riders turns.  I am the blood of the dragon, Daenerys Targaryen reminded Daenerys Targaryen as Daenerys Targaryen turned Daenerys Targaryen face away. She pressed She lips together and hardened She heart and rode on toward the gate.     She wanted to cry, but She told She that She must be strong.  "I've told the khal the khal ought to make for Meereen," Ser Jorah said.   If enough children survive the journey, the gold will buy us all the ships we need, and hire men to sail enough children."        She spoke to She khas in the harsh accents of Dothraki.    Jorah Mormont spurred Jorah Mormont horse closer.    Now they claim they reward." Across the road, the girl was still crying, the girl high singsong tongue strange to Dany's ears. The first man  was done with her now, and a second had taken The first man   place.    The Lamb Men lay with sheep, The Lamb Men is known."   "If her wailing offends your ears, Khaleesi, Jhogo will bring you her tongue." He drew He arakh.     Quaro and the others followed Quaro lead, the bells in Quaro and the others hair chiming.             Jhogo's arakh flashed, and the man's head went tumbling from the man shoulders.  She saw Aggo point across the road to where She sat upon She silver.    All the while the man atop the lamb girl continued to plunge in and out of the lamb girl, so intent on the man atop the lamb girl pleasure that the man atop the lamb girl seemed unaware of what was going on around the man atop the lamb girl. Ser Jorah dismounted and wrenched Ser Jorah off with a mailed hand.  Mormont pulled the girl off the pile of corpses and wrapped the girl in Mormont blood-spattered cloak.   The girl was trembling, The girl eyes wide and vague.       Many of the houses were afire, and the jaqqa rhan had been about the houses grisly work.   Each time Dany reined up, sent her khas to make an end to her khas, and claimed the victim as slave.  They were suspicious of her, her realized with sadness; afraid that her had saved They for some worse fate. "You cannot claim them all, child," Ser Jorah said, the fourth time  them all stopped, while the warriors of Ser Jorah khas herded Ser Jorah new slaves behind Ser Jorah. "I am khaleesi, heir to the Seven Kingdoms, the blood of the dragon," Dany reminded the dragon.    Beside him was a pile of heads taller than him was. One of the short arrows of the Lamb Men stuck through the meat of his upper arm, and blood covered the left side of his bare chest like a splash of paint. His three bloodriders were with His. Jhiqui helped Dany dismount; Jhiqui had grown clumsy as Jhiqui belly grew larger and heavier.  The arakh cut was wide but shallow; The arakh cut left nipple was gone, and a flap of bloody flesh and skin dangled from The arakh cut chest like a wet rag.   He turned He head, the bells in He braid ringing softly. "Is Ogo you hear, and Fogo his khalakka, who was khal when I slew his."  A mounted warrior rode up and vaulted from A mounted warrior saddle.  The huge bloodrider gave The huge bloodrider a heavy look before he turned to he khaL "This one is Mago, who rides in the khas of Ko Jhaqo. He says the khaleesi has taken He spoils, a daughter of the lambs who was He to mount." Khal Drogo's face was still and hard, but Khal Drogo's black eyes were curious as they went to Dany.  Dany told Dany what she had done, in Dany own tongue so the khal would understand she better, she words simple and direct.     "If your warriors would mount these women, let your warriors would mount these women take your warriors would mount these women gently and keep your warriors would mount these women for wives. Give them places in the khalasar and let them bear you sons."     Dany turned on Dany angrily.     "It is my son inside her, the stallion who  mounts the world, filling her with his fire.       He started to reach out a hand to Daenerys, but as He lifted He arm Drogo grimaced in sudden pain and turned He head. Dany could almost feel Dany agony. The wounds were worse than Ser Jorah had led The wounds to believe.      "The khal sent the hairless men away, Khaleesi," old Cohollo assured old Cohollo. Dany saw the bloodrider had taken a wound himself; a deep gash in Dany left shoulder.    Dany could see the muscles in Dany chest where the skin had been cut away.  "It is not for Khal Drogo to wait," Khal Drogo proclaimed. "Jhogo, seek out these eunuchs and bring these eunuchs here at once." "Silver Lady," a woman's voice said behind Silver Lady, "I can help the Great Rider with his hurts."  The speaker was one of the slaves The speaker had claimed, the heavy, flat-nosed woman who had blessed The speaker.   Aggo grabbed Aggo hair and pressed a knife to Aggo throat.   She is She.  Aggo looked from Aggo to Qotho. He lowered He knife.   The robes she wore had once been the lightest and finest of woolens, rich with embroidery, but now The robes she wore were mud-caked and bloody and ripped. She clutched the torn cloth of She bodice to She heavy breasts.        Dany remembered the word from a terrifying story that Jhiqui had told Jhiqui one night by the cookfire. A maegi was a woman who lay with demons and practiced the blackest of sorceries, a vile thing, evil and soulless, who came to men in the dark of night and sucked life and strength from men in the dark of night bodies.          A moonsinger of the Jogos Nhai gifted me with A moonsinger of the Jogos Nhai birthing songs, a woman of your own riding people taught me the magics of grass and corn and horse, and a maester from the Sunset Lands opened a body for me and showed me all the secrets that hide beneath the skin."   "Marwyn, he named he," the woman replied in the Common Tongue.        "Tell me, Godswife, what did this Marwyn wear about Godswife neck?"   "Only a man trained in the Citadel of Oldtown wears such a chain," Only a man trained in the Citadel of Oldtown said, "and such men do know much of healing."   "The Great Shepherd sent me to earth to heal The Great Shepherd lambs, wherever I might find his lambs." Qotho gave Qotho a stinging slap.   "She is She.    "Yes, Great Rider," Mirri Maz Duur answered, touching Mirri Maz Duur bruised face.      "I need no man's help," no man said, in a voice proud and hard.  A fresh wave of blood ran down his breast, from where Ogo's arakh had cut off his nipple. Dany moved quickly to Dany side. "I am no man," she whispered, "so you may lean on she." Drogo put a huge hand on Drogo shoulder. She took some of his weight as some of his weight walked toward the great mud temple.        Khal Drogo lay upon Khal Drogo.        He drew He skinning knife and showed her the blade.  Dany felt she could trust this old, plainfaced woman with she flat nose; she had saved she from the hard hands of she rapers, after all.   Hold him still while I draw the arrow from him flesh." She let the rags of She gown fall to She waist as She opened a carved chest, and busied She with bottles and boxes, knives and needles. When she was ready, she broke off the barbed arrowhead and pulled out the shaft, chanting in the singsong tongue of the Lhazareen. She heated a flagon of wine to boiling on the brazier, and poured a flagon of wine over the brazier wounds. Khal Drogo cursed Khal Drogo, but Khal Drogo did not move. She bound the arrow wound with a plaster of wet leaves and turned to the gash on his breast, smearing the gash on his breast with a pale green paste before She pulled the flap of skin back in place. The khal ground The khal teeth together and swallowed a scream.  When she was done she painted the skin with red ointment, covered the skin with red ointment with more leaves, and bound the breast in a ragged piece of lambskin.     He flexed He arm and scowled.              "Moon of my life, you do not ask a slave, you tell a slave.        "As you say, rider," the woman answered him, gathering up the woman jars and bottles.   There, beside his pavilion, Lord Tywin took Lord Tywin evening meal with Lord Tywin chief knights and lords bannermen, Lord Tywin great crimson-and-gold standard waving overhead from a lofty pike. Tyrion arrived late, saddlesore, and sour, all too vividly aware of how amusing Tyrion must look as Tyrion waddled up the slope to Tyrion father.  He thought He might get quite drunk tonight.    "My pardons," My pardons began, taking My pardons place on the bench beside My pardons uncle.     He filled He wine cup and watched a serving man carve into the pig.   "Ser Addam's outriders say the Stark host has moved south from the Twins," the Stark host father reported as the Stark host trencher was filled with slices of pork. "Lord Frey's levies have joined Lord Frey's levies.     Your brother Jaime would be eager to come to grips with Your brother Jaime."  Robb Stark is not half so tender, and Robb Stark never smelled as good." Lord Lefford, the sour bird who had charge of Lord Lefford, the sour bird who had charge of their stores and supplies stores and supplies, leaned forward. "I hope your savages do not share your reluctance, else we've wasted we good steel on your savages."  When he had told Lefford he needed arms and armor to equip the three hundred men Ulf had fetched down out of the foothills, you would have thought he'd asked the man to turn the man virgin daughters over to his virgin daughters pleasure.    "He still had that wood-axe of He strapped to He back."  Tyrion reached a thumb and forefinger into the salt dish, and sprinkled a healthy pinch over Tyrion meat.  "We had a thought to put you and your wildlings in the vanguard when We come to battle."  Tyrion had skewered a chunk of meat on the point of Tyrion dagger and brought a chunk of meat to Tyrion mouth.    Either his lord father had a new respect for Tyrion's abilities, or his'd decided to rid his of his embarrassing get for good. Tyrion had the gloomy feeling Tyrion knew which.   Tyrion realized Tyrion was echoing Tyrion uncle like a trained bird. His father watched, judging His, weighing every word.   So today as we made camp three Stone Crows seized the man and opened the man throat for the man.  Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even so Ulf is demanding blood money, which Conn and Shagga refuse to pay." "When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with soldiers lord commander," his father said. His brother Jaime had always been able to make men follow His brother Jaime eagerly, and die for His brother Jaime if need be.  He bought loyalty with gold, and compelled obedience with He name. "A bigger man would be able to put the fear in the fear, is that what you're saying, my lord?" Lord Tywin Lannister turned to Lord Tywin Lannister brother. "If my son's men will not obey my son commands, perhaps the vanguard is not the place for my son.    Lord Tywin studied Lord Tywin dwarf son.   Tyrion took one bite of pork, chewed a moment, and spit one bite of pork out angrily.   Lord Tywin inclined Lord Tywin head, dismissing Lord Tywin.  He was conscious of their eyes on He back as He waddled down the hill. A great gust of laughter went up from behind him, but him did not look back. He hoped they all choked on they all suckling pigs.      He caught the scent of garlic sausage, spiced and savory, so tempting the scent of garlic sausage, spiced and savory made He empty stomach growl.  A giggling woman raced past him, naked beneath a dark cloak, A giggling woman drunken pursuer stumbling over tree roots. Farther on, two spearmen faced each other across a little trickle of a stream, practicing two spearmen thrust- and-parry in the fading light, two spearmen chests bare and slick with sweat.    He was surrounded by men sworn to House Lannister, a vast host twenty thousand strong, and yet He was alone. When he heard the deep rumble of Shagga's laughter booming through the dark, he followed the deep rumble of Shagga's laughter to the Stone Crows in their small corner of the night.             Each clan had Each clan own cookfire; Black Ears did not eat with Stone Crows, Stone Crows did not eat with Moon Brothers, and no one ate with Burned Men.   Lord Tywin had sent Lord Tywin a groom and a body servant to see to a groom and a body servant needs, and even insisted a groom and a body servant take a squire.  A girl was with them; slim, dark-haired, no more than eighteen by the look of A girl. Tyrion studied Tyrion face for a moment, before Tyrion spied fishbones in the ashes.    Trout, Trout thought.   He stared mournfully at the bones, He belly rumbling. His squire, a boy with the unfortunate name of Podrick Payne, swallowed whatever His had been about to say.     Tyrion had made Tyrion stick Tyrion out once, just to be certain.   At the moment, he did not have the patience to try and coax a thought out of the lad, whom he suspected had been inflicted on he as a cruel jape. Tyrion turned Tyrion attention back to the girl.    "It is, m'lord, and m'lord can speak for m'lord, if It please you." He cocked He head to one side.          He lifted the flap and held the flap for her.    At the end of the day's march, Tyrion had sent Bronn back to find Bronn a likely whore.   If she hasn't, wash she. Be certain that you tell her who I am, and warn her of what I am."  There was a look the girls got in the girls eyes sometimes when the girls first beheld the lordling the girls'd been hired to pleasure .     Bronn had done well enough; Bronn was doe-eyed and slim, with small firm breasts and a smile that was by turns shy, insolent, and wicked.         Tyrion decided Tyrion would get along splendidly.           She reached down to the hem of She thin roughspun gown and pulled roughspun up over She head in one smooth motion, tossing roughspun aside.  "If he don't put down that candle, m1ord will burn he fingers." Tyrion put down the candle, took Tyrion hand in Tyrion, and pulled Tyrion gently to Tyrion.  Her mouth tasted of honey and cloves, and Her fingers were deft and practiced as they found the fastenings of his clothes. When he entered her, her welcomed he with whispered endearments and small, shuddering gasps of pleasure. Tyrion suspected Tyrion delight was feigned, but Tyrion did it so well that it did not matter.  He had needed her, Tyrion realized afterward, as her lay quietly in He arms. Her or someone like Her. It had been nigh on a year since he'd lain with a woman, since before he had set out for Winterfell in company with he brother and King Robert. He could well die on the morrow or the day after, and if He did, He would sooner go to He grave thinking of Shae than of He lord father, Lysa Arryn, or the Lady Catelyn Stark. He could feel the softness of her breasts pressed against He arm as her lay beside He.     Shae murmured against Shae.    When her eyes were closed and her breathing deep and steady, Tyrion slid out from beneath her, gently, so as not to disturb her sleep. Naked, Naked crawled outside, stepped over Naked squire, and walked around behind Naked tent to make water.  He was honing the edge of He sword, wide awake; the sellsword did not seem to sleep like other men.  Tyrion asked Tyrion as Tyrion pissed.  The man was loath to give her up, but your name changed The man thinking somewhat .        Tyrion limped closer to where Tyrion sat.        Did you perchance note the name of this knight you took this knight from?  Bronn rose, cat-quick and cat-graceful, turning Bronn sword in Bronn hand.     Bronn tossed the longsword from Bronn right hand to Bronn left, and tried a cut.         Bronn sheathed Bronn sword.  When Tyrion returned to Tyrion tent, Shae rolled onto Tyrion elbow and murmured sleepily, "I woke and m'lord was gone."   Her hand went between his stunted legs, and found his hard. "Yes he is," she whispered, stroking he. He asked her about the man Bronn had taken her from, and her named the minor retainer of an insignificant lordling. "You need not fear his like, m'lord," the girl said, the girl fingers busy at his cock.   Tyrion asked Tyrion.   She mounted him then, and for a time, She almost made him believe it.     Shae was shaking Shae by the shoulder.      He heard shouts, the clatter of spears, the whicker of horses, though nothing yet that spoke to He of fighting. "My lord father's trumpets," My lord father said.   Shae shook Shae head, lost.  Groaning, Tyrion lurched to Tyrion feet and pushed Tyrion way outside, shouting for Tyrion squire.    Knights vaulted onto snorting coursers while men-at-arms buckled men-at-arms sword belts as men-at-arms ran.  Tyrion gave Tyrion a sharp poke in the ribs with Tyrion toe.  Bronn came trotting out of the mists, already armored and ahorse, wearing Bronn battered halfhelm.  Tyrion asked Tyrion.  "He crept down the kingsroad in the night, and now He host is less than a mile north of here, forming up in battle array."   Tyrion ducked back inside Tyrion tent.    No, the leather, damn the leather.   By the time he was dressed, he squire had laid out he armor, such that it was. Tyrion owned a fine suit of heavy plate, expertly crafted to fit Tyrion misshapen body.   Some of it was ornate, some plain; not a bit of it matched, or fit as it should. His breastplate was meant for a bigger man; for His oversize head, they found a huge bucket-shaped greathelm topped with a foot-long triangular spike.       Shae lowered the greathelm down over Shae head, and Pod fastened the greathelm to Shae gorget. Tyrion buckled on Tyrion belt, heavy with the weight of shortsword and dirk. By then his groom had brought up his mount, a formidable brown courser armored as heavily as his was. He needed help to mount; He felt as though He weighed a thousand stone. Pod handed Pod up Pod shield, a massive slab of heavy ironwood banded with steel. Lastly they gave him him battle-axe.     He saluted her with He axe, wheeled He horse about, and trotted off. His stomach was a hard knot, so tight His stomach pained His. Behind, his servants hurriedly began to strike his tent.   Tyrion wondered whether this was the last sunrise Tyrion would ever see .      The clansmen climbed onto The clansmen scrawny mountain horses, shouting curses and rude jokes.    The mountain men fell in behind him, each clan arrayed behind The mountain men own leaders.   Ser Kevan had raised Ser Kevan standards above the kingsroad. Quivers hanging from their belts, the foot archers arrayed the foot archers into three long lines, to east and west of the road,  and stood calmly stringing the foot archers bows.   The right wing was all cavalry, some four thousand men, heavy with the weight of some armor.   Tyrion saw Tyrion banner unfurl as Tyrion standardbearer shook it out; a burning tree, orange and smoke.  His lord father took His lord father place on the hill where His lord father had slept.  Lord Tywin almost always chose to command the reserve; Lord Tywin would take the high ground and watch the battle unfold below Lord Tywin, committing Lord Tywin forces when and where his forces were needed most.  Tywin Lannister's battle armor put Tywin Lannister son Jaime's gilded suit to shame. His greatcloak was sewn from countless layers of cloth-of-gold, so heavy that His greatcloak barely stirred even when His charged, so large that His greatcloak drape covered most of His stallion's hindquarters when His took the saddle.     His rondels were golden sunbursts, all His fastenings were gilded, and the red steel was burnished to such a high sheen that His rondels shone like fire in the light of the rising sun.  He remembered Robb Stark as He had last seen Robb Stark, in Robb Stark father's high seat in the Great Hall of Winterfell, a sword naked and shining in Robb Stark hands. He remembered how the direwolves had come at He out of the shadows, and suddenly He could see the direwolves again, snarling and snapping, teeth bared in He face. Would the boy bring the boy wolves to war with the boy?  The northerners would be exhausted after The northerners long sleepless march.  Did he think to take them unawares while them slept?     Bronn took one look at Bronn and grinned.     That one, That one'll draw the eyes of every bowman on the field."   Clegane had no splendor about Clegane; Clegane armor was steel plate, dull grey, scarred by hard use and  showing neither sigil nor ornament. He was pointing men into position with He blade, a two-handed greatsword that Ser Gregor waved about with one hand as a lesser man might wave a dagger. "Any man runs, I'll cut Any man down Any man," Any man was roaring when Any man caught sight of Tyrion.       Tyrion led Tyrion men toward the riverbank. "Look," he shouted, pointing with he axe.       Let no enemy come between us and us river. If they dirty our waters, hack off they cocks and feed their cocks to the fishes."  He smashed them together and made them ring.    The Burned Men did not shout, but The Burned Men rattled The Burned Men swords and spears.    Tyrion turned Tyrion courser in a circle to look over the field.   His heart pounded in His chest in time to the drums, and under His layers of leather and steel His brow was cold with sweat.     Had his lord father taken leave of his lord father senses?    how could his father expect this travesty of a battle to hold his father left?  The drums were so near that the beat crept under his skin and set his hands to twitching. Bronn drew Bronn longsword, and suddenly the enemy was there before the enemy, boiling over the tops of the hills, advancing with measured tread behind a wall of shields and pikes. Gods be damned, look at Gods, Tyrion thought, though Tyrion knew Tyrion father had more men on the field. Their captains led Their on armored warhorses, standard-bearers riding alongside with Their banners.     So much for his father's certainty that Lord Walder would not bestir Lord Walder.     Haroooooooooooooooooooooooo, Haroooooooooooooooooooooooo cried, Haroooooooooooooooooooooooo voice as long and low and chilling as a cold wind from the north. The Lannister trumpets answered, da-DA da-DA da-DAAAAAAAAA, brazen and defiant, yet it seemed to Tyrion that The Lannister trumpets sounded somehow smaller, more anxious. He could feel a fluttering in He bowels, a queasy liquid feeling; He hoped He was not going to die sick.  The northerners broke into a run, shouting as The northerners came, but the Lannister arrows fell on The northerners like hail, hundreds of arrows, thousands, and shouts turned to screams as men stumbled and went down. By then a second flight was in the air, and the archers were fitting a third arrow to the archers bowstrings.  Ser Gregor waved Ser Gregor huge sword and bellowed a command, and a thousand other voices screamed back at Ser Gregor. Tyrion put Tyrion spurs to Tyrion horse and added one more voice to the cacophony, and the van surged forward.  he shouted at he clansmen as his clansmen rode.  He was still leading when they broke a canter, until Chella gave a bloodcurdling shriek and galloped past He, and Shagga howled and followed. The clansmen charged after The clansmen charged after them, leaving Tyrion in The clansmen charged after them dust.   Half the horses shied at the last second, breaking Half the horses charge before the row of spears. The others died, sharp steel points ripping through The others chests.  The Mountain's stallion reared, lashing out with iron-shod hooves as a barbed spearhead raked across The Mountain's stallion neck.  Spears thrust at him from every side, but the shield wall broke beneath him weight.  As his horse fell, snorting blood and biting with his last red breath, the Mountain rose untouched, laying about his with his two-handed greatsword. Shagga went bursting through the gap before the shields could close, other Stone Crows hard behind Shagga.     He glimpsed Timett son of Timett vault free as He mount died under He in full stride, saw a Moon Brother impaled on a Karstark spear, watched Conn's horse shatter a man's ribs with a kick. A flight of arrows descended on them; where them came from A flight of arrows could not say, but them fell on Stark and Lannister alike, rattling off armor or finding flesh. Tyrion lifted Tyrion shield and hid beneath his shield.  Tyrion saw Shagga catch a spearman full in the chest as the fool came on at a run, saw Tyrion saw Shagga axe shear through mail and leather and muscle and lungs. The man was dead on The man feet, the axehead lodged in The man breast, yet Shagga rode on, cleaving a shield in two with The man left-hand battle-axe while the corpse was bouncing and stumbling bonelessly along on The man right.   By then the enemy was on him, and Tyrion's battle shrunk to the few feet of ground around him horse. A man-at-arms thrust at man-at-arms chest and man-at-arms axe lashed out, knocking the spear aside. The man danced back for another try, but Tyrion spurred The man horse and rode right over The man. Bronn was surrounded by three foes, but Bronn lopped the head off the first spear that came at Bronn, and raked Bronn blade across a second man's face on Bronn backslash. A thrown spear came hurtling at Tyrion from the left and lodged in A thrown spear shield with a woody chunk. He  wheeled and raced after the thrower, but the man raised the man own shield over the man head. Tyrion circled around Tyrion, raining axe blows down on the wood. Chips of oak went flying, until the northerner lost the northerner feet and slipped, failing flat on the northerner back with the northerner shield on top of the northerner. He was below the reach of Tyrion's axe and it was too much bother to dismount, so He left He there and rode after another man, taking He from behind with a sweeping downcut that sent a jolt of impact up He arm.     A Burned Man rode past, slumped against A Burned Man horse. A spear had entered A spear belly and come out through A spear back. He was past any help, but when Tyrion saw one of the northerners run up and make a grab for Tyrion reins, Tyrion charged. His quarry met His sword in hand. He was tall and spare, wearing a long chainmail hauberk and gauntlets of lobstered steel, but He'd lost He helm and blood ran down into He eyes from a gash across He forehead. Tyrion aimed a swipe at Tyrion face, but the tall man slammed Tyrion aside.   He turned in a circle as Tyrion rode around He, hacking at He head and shoulders. Steel rang on steel, and Tyrion soon realized that the tall man was quicker and stronger than the tall man was.  "Die," the man grunted, chopping at the man savagely. Tyrion barely got Tyrion shield up in time, and the wood seemed to explode inward under the force of the blow.   the swordsman bellowed, shoving in close and whanging Tyrion across the temple so hard the swordsman head rang. The blade made a hideous scraping sound as The blade drew The blade back over the steel.      Tyrion buried Tyrion axe in Tyrion head. "You die," he told he, and he did. As he wrenched the blade free, he heard a shout.    The knight came thundering down on him, swinging the spiked ball of a morningstar around him head. Their warhorses slammed together before Tyrion could so much as open Tyrion mouth to shout for Bronn.   He clawed for He sword, but the morningstar was circling again, coming at He face.  He did not recall hitting the ground, but when He looked up there was only sky above He. He rolled onto He side and tried to find He feet, but pain shuddered through He and the world throbbed. The knight who had felled him drew up above him.    Yes, Tyrion thought, but the word caught in Tyrion throat. He made a croaking sound and fought He way to He knees, fumbling for a weapon. His sword, His dirk, anything .    The knight loomed overhead on The knight armored warhorse.   Tyrion's hands were numb, Tyrion vision blurred, Tyrion scabbard empty. "Yield or die," the knight declared, the knight flail whirling faster and faster. Tyrion lurched to Tyrion feet, driving Tyrion head into the horse's belly.   The next he knew, he visor was packed with mud and something was crushing he foot. He wriggled free, He throat so tight He could scarce talk.        Tyrion scraped the mud off Tyrion helm so Tyrion could see again. The horse had fallen away from him, onto The horse rider. The knight's leg was trapped, the arm The knight'd used to break The knight fall twisted at a grotesque angle.  Fumbling at his belt with his good hand, his drew a sword and flung a sword at Tyrion's feet.   Pain hammered through Pain elbow when Pain moved Pain arm.  No one remained on No one part of the field save a large number of corpses.  He saw that Ser Kevan had brought up He center in support of the van; He huge mass of pikemen had pushed the northerners back against the hills.     The sound of hooves coming up behind him made him whirl, though him could scarcely lift the sword him held for the agony in him elbow.  "Small use you turned out to be," Tyrion told Tyrion.         Tyrion watched Tyrion father fly past, the crimson-and-gold banner of Lannister rippling over Tyrion head as Tyrion thundered across the field. Five hundred knights surrounded him, sunlight flashing off the points of Five hundred knights lances.  With his elbow swollen and throbbing inside his armor, Tyrion made no attempt to join the slaughter. He and Bronn went looking for He men.  Ulf son of Umar lay in a pool of congealing blood, Ulf son of Umar arm gone at the elbow, a dozen of Ulf son of Umar Moon Brothers sprawled around Ulf son of Umar. Shagga was slumped beneath a tree, riddled with arrows, Conn's head in Shagga lap. Tyrion thought they were both dead, but as Tyrion dismounted, Shagga opened Tyrion eyes and said, "they have killed Conn son of Coratt." Handsome Conn had no mark but for the red stain over Handsome Conn breast, where the spear thrust had killed Handsome Conn. When Bronn pulled Shagga to Bronn feet, the big man seemed to notice the arrows for the first time. He plucked them out one by one, cursing the holes them had made in He layers of mail and leather, and yowling like a babe at the few that had buried them in He flesh. Chella daughter of Cheyk rode up as they were yanking arrows out of Shagga, and showed they four ears Chella daughter of Cheyk had taken. Timett they discovered looting the bodies of the slain with the slain Burned Men.  He left the living to look after the dead, sent Bronn to take charge of He captive knight, and went alone in search of He father. Lord Tywin was seated by the river, sipping wine from a jeweled cup as Lord Tywin squire undid the fastenings on Lord Tywin breastplate. "A fine victory," Ser Kevan said when Ser Kevan saw Tyrion.  His father's eyes were on His, pale green flecked with gold, so cool they gave Tyrion a chill.    We were supposed to be butchered, were We not?" Lord Tywin drained Lord Tywin cup, Lord Tywin face expressionless.    I'd hoped that if he saw our left collapse, he might plunge into the gap, eager for a rout. Once he was fully committed, Ser Kevan's pikes would wheel and take Ser Kevan's in the flank, driving Ser Kevan's into the river while I brought up the reserve."    Tyrion pulled off Tyrion steel gauntlet and let his steel gauntlet fall to the ground, wincing at the pain that stabbed up Tyrion arm. "The Stark boy proved more cautious than I expected for one of The Stark boy years," Lord Tywin admitted, "but a victory is a victory.   "Good of you to notice, Father," Father said through clenched teeth.      turned his father's head before his could reply. Tywin Lannister rose to Tywin Lannister feet as Ser Addam Marbrand leapt down off Tywin Lannister courser.  Ser Addam dropped to one knee, a rangy man with dark copper hair that fell to Ser Addam shoulders, armored in burnished bronzed steel with the fiery tree of Ser Addam House etched black on Ser Addam breastplate.        They say he crossed at the Twins with the great part of he horse, riding hard for Riverrun."  He would have laughed, if He hadn't hurt so much.  Moonlight winked on the tumbling waters of the stream below as Moonlight wound Moonlight rocky way along the floor of the valley.    He had asked for the honor of protecting her in the battle to come; it was He right, as Winterfell's captain of guards, and Robb had not refused it to He. She had thirty men around She, charged to keep She unharmed and see She safely home to Winterfell if the fighting went against thirty men around her. Robb had wanted fifty; Catelyn had insisted that ten would be enough, that Robb would need every sword for the fight. They made They peace at thirty, neither happy with it. "It will come when It comes," Catelyn told Catelyn.        Catelyn was content to wait, to listen to the whispers in the woods and the faint music of the brook, to feel the warm wind in Catelyn hair.  Her men had always made Her wait. "Watch for me, little cat," her father would always tell her, when her father rode off to court or fair or battle.  He did not always come when He said He would, and days would ofttimes pass as Catelyn stood Catelyn vigil, peering out between crenels and through arrow loops until Catelyn caught a glimpse of Lord Hoster on Lord Hoster old brown gelding, trotting along the rivershore toward the landing.  he'd ask when he bent to bug her.  Brandon Stark had bid Brandon Stark wait as well. "I shall not be long, my lady," my lady had vowed. "We will be Wed on my return." Yet when the day came at last, the day was his brother Eddard who stood beside her in the sept. Ned had lingered scarcely a fortnight with Ned new bride before Ned too had ridden off to war with promises on Ned lips. At least he had left her with more than words; he had given her a son. Nine moons had waxed and waned, and Robb had been born in Riverrun while Robb father still warred in the south. She had brought him forth in blood and pain, not knowing whether Ned would ever see Ned.          And he had wagered their lives and their best hope of victory on the truth of what he said. If Robb was frightened, Robb gave no sign of Robb was frightened. Catelyn watched Catelyn son as her son moved among the men, touching one on the shoulder, sharing a jest with another, helping a third to gentle an anxious horse. His armor clinked softly when His moved.  Catelyn watched a breeze stir Catelyn auburn hair, so like Catelyn own, and wondered when Catelyn son had grown so big.    Let him grow as tall as him father, and hold him own son in him arms.  As she watched him, this tall young man with the new beard and the direwolf prowling at him heels, all she could see was the babe this tall young man with the new beard and the direwolf prowling at his heels  had laid at she breast at Riverrun, so long ago. The night was warm, but the thought of Riverrun was enough to make Riverrun shiver.     Robb had given the Blackfish three hundred picked men, and sent the Blackfish three hundred picked men ahead to screen Robb march. "Jaime does not know," Ser Brynden said when Ser Brynden rode back.   We've seen a few of his outriders, but those that saw We did not live to tell of his outriders.     "Twelve thousand foot, scattered around the castle in three separate camps, with the rivers between," her uncle said, with the craggy smile her uncle remembered so well.        Their host was greater than it had been when Their left the Twins. Lord Jason Mallister had brought Lord Jason Mallister power out from Seagard to join them as them swept around the headwaters of the Blue Fork and galloped south, and others had crept forth as well, hedge knights and small lords and masterless men-at-arms who had fled north when her brother Edmure's army was shattered beneath the walls of Riverrun. They had driven They horses as hard as They dared to reach this place before Jaime Lannister had word of They coming, and now the hour was at hand. Catelyn watched Catelyn son mount up. 01yvar Frey held 01yvar Frey horse for 01yvar Frey, Lord Walder's son, two years older than Robb, and ten years younger and more anxious. He strapped Robb's shield in place and handed up He helm. When he lowered it over the face she loved so well, a tall young knight sat on he grey stallion where she son had been.  When Robb turned Robb head to look at Robb, Robb could see only black inside Robb visor. "I must ride down the line, Mother," he told Mother.      she wondered, yet she kept she silence and made she smile for him. Robb turned the big grey stallion and walked Robb slowly away from her, Grey Wind shadowing Robb steps. Behind him him battle guard formed up. When he'd forced Catelyn to accept Catelyn protectors, Catelyn had insisted that he be guarded as well, and the lords bannermen had agreed. Many of their sons had clamored for the honor of riding with the Young Wolf, as their had taken to calling him. Torrhen Karstark and Torrhen Karstark brother Eddard were  among Torrhen Karstark thirty, and Patrek Mallister, Smalljon Umber, Daryn Hornwood, Theon Greyjoy, no less than five of Walder Frey's vast brood, along with older men like Ser Wendel Manderly and Robin Flint.  Some of the other lords muttered about that, but Catelyn would not listen to Some of the other lords complaints. "This is not about the honor of your houses," she told your houses.      She knew their call well enough, from She years at Winterfell.                  only for an instant, framed between the branches of the trees as she looked down at the valley floor, yet she knew it was him.  The moonlight had silvered his armor and the gold of his hair, and turned his crimson cloak to black.  He was there and He was gone again, He silvery armor obscured by the trees once more.  "He is no man for sitting in a tent while He carpenters build siege towers," Ser Brynden had promised. "He has ridden out with He knights thrice already, to chase down raiders or storm a stubborn holdfast." Nodding, Robb had studied the map her uncle had drawn Robb. Ned had taught Ned to read maps. "Raid him here," him said, pointing.   When he comes after you, we will be waiting"-he finger moved an inch to the left-"here."  Here was her son on his stallion, glancing back at her one last time and lifting his sword in salute. Here was the call of Maege Mormont's warhorn, a long low blast that rolled down the valley from the east, to tell the call of Maege Mormont's warhorn, a long low blast that rolled down the valley from the east that the last of Jaime's riders had entered the trap.  The sound seemed to go right through Catelyn Stark, and Catelyn Stark found Catelyn Stark shivering. It was a terrible sound, a frightening sound, yet there was music in It too.  So this is what death sounds like, death thought. HAAroooooooooooooooooooooooo came the answer from the far ridge as the Greatjon winded HAAroooooooooooooooooooooooo own horn.  North, where the valley narrowed and bent like a cocked elbow, Lord Karstark's warhorns added Lord Karstark's warhorns own deep, mournful voices to the dark chorus.  The whispering wood let out The whispering wood breath all at once, as the bowmen Robb had hidden in the branches of the trees let fly their arrows and the night erupted with the screams of men and horses. All around her, the riders raised the riders lances, and the dirt and leaves that had buried the cruet bright points fell away to reveal the gleam of sharpened steel.   He moved away from her at a trot, leading He men downhill. Catelyn sat on Catelyn horse, unmoving, with Hal Mollen and Catelyn guard around Catelyn, and Catelyn waited as Catelyn had waited before, for Brandon and Ned and Catelyn father. She was high on the ridge, and the trees hid most of what was going on beneath She. A heartbeat, two, four, and suddenly it was as if she and she protectors were alone in the wood.  Yet when she looked across the valley to the far ridge, she saw the Greatjon's riders emerge from the darkness beneath the trees. They were in a long line, an endless line, and as They burst from the wood there was an instant, the smallest part of a heartbeat, when all Catelyn saw was the moonlight on the points of They lances, as if a thousand willowisps were coming down the ridge, wreathed in silver flame.  Afterward, she could not claim she had seen the battle.    When she realized there was no more to see, she closed she eyes and listened. The battle came alive around The battle.    Once she heard Robb's voice, as clear as if Robb'd been standing at she side, calling, "To Robb!       Robb came back to Robb on a different horse, riding a piebald gelding in the place of the grey stallion Robb had taken down into the valley. The wolf's head on The wolf shield was slashed half to pieces, raw wood  showing where deep gouges had been hacked in the oak, but Robb himself seemed unhurt. Yet when he came closer, Catelyn saw that he mailed glove and the sleeve of he surcoat were black with blood.  Robb lifted Robb hand, opened and closed Robb fingers.     Torrhen's blood, perhaps, or Torrhen shook Torrhen head.  A mob of men followed him up the slope, dirty and dented and grinning, with Theon and the Greatjon at A mob of men head. Between them them dragged Ser Jaime Lannister.   Lannister raised Lannister head. "Lady Stark," he said from he knees. Blood ran down one cheek from a gash across his scalp, but the pale light of dawn had put the glint of gold back in his hair. "I would offer you my sword, but I seem to have mislaid my sword."         "No," her son answered, peeling off her son bloody glove.    "Take him away and put him in irons," Catelyn said. "Do as my lady mother says," Robb commanded, "and make certain there's a strong guard around Robb. Lord Karstark will want Lord Karstark head on a pike."   "Why should Lord Karstark want Lord Karstark dead?"             "No one can fault Lannister on Lannister courage," Glover said. "When he saw that he was lost, he rallied he retainers and fought he way up the valley, hoping to reach Lord Robb and cut Lord Robb down.  "He mislaid He sword in Eddard Karstark's neck, after He took Torrhen's hand off and split Daryn Hornwood's skull open," Robb said. "All the time he was shouting for he.  "Your men did what Your men were sworn to do, Robb. They died protecting They liege lord.  Honor them for them valor.             and three Lannisters besides Jaime, Lord Tywin's own nephews, two of Lord Tywin's sister's sons and one of Lord Tywin's dead brother's .        Robb raised Robb head and pushed Robb hair back out of Robb eyes.       The only sounds were the steady clop of The only sounds horses' hooves, the rhythmic tingle of the bells in Drogo's hair, and the distant voices behind The only sounds.    They lived in marshes and stagnant pools, sucked blood from man and horse alike, and laid They eggs in the dead and dying.  Whenever one came near him, him hand would shoot out quick as a striking snake to close around his hand.  He would hold the fly inside He huge fist long enough to hear the fly inside his huge fist frantic buzzing. Then his fingers would tighten, and when his opened his hand again, the fly would be only a red smear on his palm. Now one crept across the rump of one stallion, and the horse gave an angry flick of the horse tail to brush the horse away.   His eyes were fixed on distant brown hills, the reins loose in His hands. Beneath his painted vest, a plaster of fig leaves and caked blue mud covered the wound on his  breast. The herbwomen had made The herbwomen for The herbwomen. Mirri Maz Duur's poultice had itched and burned, and Mirri Maz Duur's had torn Mirri Maz Duur's poultice off six days ago, cursing Mirri Maz Duur's for a maegi.  He'd been drinking it heavily these past three days; when it was not poppy wine, it was fermented mare's milk or pepper beer. Yet he scarcely touched he food, and he thrashed and groaned in the night. Dany could see how drawn Dany face had become. Rhaego was restless in Rhaego belly, kicking like a stallion, yet even that did not stir Drogo's interest as Drogo had. Every morning her eyes found fresh lines of pain on his face when his woke from his troubled sleep.    When she spoke, she got no answer but a grunt, and not even that much since midday.  Another, circling, touched down on Another neck and crept up toward Another mouth. Khal Drogo swayed in the saddle, bells ringing, as Khal Drogo stallion kept onward at a steady walking pace. Dany pressed her heels into her silver and rode closer.     The bloodfly crawled up under The bloodfly drooping mustache and settled on The bloodfly cheek, in the crease beside The bloodfly nose.   Khal Drogo reeled in the saddle, tilted slowly, and fell heavily from Khal Drogo horse. The flies scattered for a heartbeat, and then circled back to settle on him where him lay.  Heedless of her belly for once, her scrambled off her silver and ran to him.  Drogo cried out in pain as Dany knelt beside Dany knelt. His breath rattled harshly in His throat, and His looked at his throat without recognition.  Dany brushed the flies off Dany chest, smashing one as Dany would have. His skin burned beneath His skin fingers.   Cohollo vaulted from Cohollo horse. "Blood of my blood," he said as he dropped to he knees.      "He fell from He horse," Haggo said, staring down. His broad face was impassive, but His voice was leaden. "You must not say that," Dany told Dany.           Cohollo, bring up the slaves, the slaves must put up the khal's tent at once.  "Find Mirri Maz Duur," Mirri Maz Duur told Mirri Maz Duur.  "Bring her to me, with her chest." Qotho glared down at Qotho, Qotho eyes hard as flint.    "You will," Dany said, "or when Drogo wakes, Dany will hear why you defied me." Furious, Qotho wheeled Qotho stallion around and galloped off in anger .   but Dany knew Dany would return with Mirri Maz Duur, however little Dany might like Mirri Maz Duur.        It was all he said, all he seemed capable of saying. Doreah unhooked Doreah medallion belt and stripped off Doreah vest and leggings, while Jhiqui knelt by Jhiqui knelt feet to undo the laces of Jhiqui knelt riding sandals. Irri wanted to leave the tent flaps open to let in the breeze, but Dany forbade the tent flaps.  When her khas came up, her khas posted them outside at guard.   Eroeh stared fearfully at Drogo where Eroeh lay.      He still wears the bells He father gave He." "Khaleesi, " Jhiqui said, "Jhiqui fell from Jhiqui horse."  He fell from He horse! It was so, she had seen It, and the bloodriders, and no doubt she handmaids and the men of she khas as well.   A khal who could not ride could not rule, and Drogo had fallen from A khal who could not ride horse.  She must not allow She to despair.  Doreah, Eroeh, find water, cool water, Doreah, Eroeh's so hot."    His eyes looked at her, but His did not see.   she demanded, she patience rubbed raw with fear.  Her handmaids filled the tub with tepid water that stank of sulfur, sweetening Her handmaids with jars of bitter oil and handfuls of crushed mint leaves. While the bath was being prepared, Dany knelt awkwardly beside Dany knelt lord husband, Dany knelt belly great with her lord husband, her belly child within. She undid his braid with anxious fingers, as She had on the night his'd taken She for the first time, beneath the stars.  He would want them again when He was well, she told she. A breath of air entered the tent as Aggo poked Aggo head through the silk.      Ser Jorah Mormont ducked through the door flap and waited a moment for Ser Jorah Mormont eyes to adjust to the dimness. In the fierce heat of the south, the fierce heat of the south wore loose trousers of mottled sandsilk and open-toed riding sandals that laced up to the fierce heat of the south knee.  Under a bleached white vest, a bleached white vest was bare-chested, skin reddened by the sun.  "It is said Khal Drogo fell from Khal Drogo horse."        When they were alone, Ser Jorah drew Ser Jorah dagger. Deftly, with a delicacy surprising in such a big man, such a big man began to scrape away the black leaves and dried blue mud from Drogo's chest. The plaster had caked hard as the mud walls of the Lamb Men, and like the mud walls of the Lamb Men. Ser Jorah broke the dry mud with Ser Jorah knife, pried the chunks from the flesh, peeled off the leaves one by one. A foul, sweet smell rose from the wound, so thick the wound almost choked her.       "No, he can't die, he mustn't, it was only a cut." Dany took Dany large callused hand in her own small ones, and held it tight between her own small ones.              It lies far to the south, at the end of the known world, yet men say It is a great port. We will find a ship to take We back to Pentos.    "Khal Drogo commanded them to keep me safe," Dany replied uncertainly, "but if Dany dies .   She touched the swell of She belly.            When he is gone, Jhaqo and Pono and the other kos will fight for he place, and this khalasar will devour this khalasar.  The boy will be taken from your breast the moment The boy is born.        "He is Drogo's son, and the crones say He will be the stallion who mounts the world.  Better to kill the child than to risk the child fury when the child grows to manhood." The child kicked inside The child, as if The child had heard. Dany remembered the story Viserys had told Viserys, of what the Usurper's dogs had done to Rhaegar's children. His son had been a babe as well, yet they had ripped His son from His son mother's breast and dashed His son head against a wall.    "I will order my khas to keep my khas safe, and Drogo's bloodriders will-" Ser Jorah held my khas by the shoulders.  They will take you to Vaes Dothrak, to the crones, that is the last duty They owe him in life .    Dany did not want to go back to Vaes Dothrak and live the rest of Vaes Dothrak life among those terrible old women, yet Vaes Dothrak knew that the knight spoke the truth. Drogo had been more than Drogo sun-and-stars; Drogo had been the shield that kept Drogo safe.      Days on the march, trailing behind the khalasar, had left her limping and haggard, with blistered and bleeding feet and hollows under her eyes. Behind her came Ootho and Haggo, carrying the godswife's chest between Ootho and Haggo. When the bloodriders caught sight of Drogo's wound, the chest slipped from Haggo's fingers and crashed to the floor of the tent, and Qotho swore an oath so foul the chest seared the air. Mirri Maz Duur studied Drogo, Mirri Maz Duur face still and dead.   Haggo laid Haggo fist across Mirri's cheek with a meaty smack that drove Haggo to the ground. Then he kicked her where her lay.      And when they are done with her, the dogs will  use her as well. Weasels will tear out her entrails and carrion crows feast upon her eyes. The flies off the river shall lay their eggs in The flies off the river womb and drink pus from the ruins of The flies off the river breasts .   He dug iron-hard fingers into the soft, wobbly flesh under the godswife's arm and hauled the godswife to the godswife feet.   Qotho's lips skinned back from Qotho crooked brown teeth in a terrible mockery of a smile.     Ser Jorah stepped between them, loosening Ser Jorah longsword in Ser Jorah scabbard.                "The Dothraki say a man and The Dothraki bloodriders share one life, and Qotho sees The Dothraki ending.     She was more frightened than She dared admit, even to She.        "Please "You do not ask a slave," Mirri replied sharply, "you tell Mirri." She went to Drogo burning on his mat, and gazed long at his wound.    She opened one with She fingers.            "All I can do now is ease the dark road before him, so him  might ride painless to the night lands.                 Mirri Maz Duur sat back on Mirri Maz Duur heels and studied Daenerys through eyes as black as night.              She must not be afraid; She was the blood of the dragon.        Dany wrapped her arms around her protectively, rocked back and forth on her heels.  She told She She would die for him, if She must. She was the blood of the dragon, She would not be afraid. Her brother Rhaegar had died for the woman Her brother Rhaegar loved.            "Bring his horse," Mirri Maz Duur commanded, and so his horse was done.  When the animal caught the scent of death, he screamed and reared, rolling he eyes. It took three men to subdue It.     Jhogo edged back, Jhogo hand on Jhogo arakh. He was a youth of sixteen years, whip-thin, fearless, quick to laugh, with the faint shadow of He first mustachio on He upper lip. He fell to He knees before her.       In Vaes Dothrak, Khal Drogo slew a stallion and I ate Khal Drogo heart, to give our son strength and courage.   The stallion kicked and reared as Rakharo, Quaro, and Aggo pulled The stallion close to the tub where the khal floated like one already dead, pus and blood seeping from The stallion wound to stain the bathwaters. Mirri Maz Duur chanted words in a tongue that Dany did not know, and a knife appeared in Mirri Maz Duur hand.  It looked old; hammered red bronze, leaf-shaped, It blade covered with ancient glyphs. The maegi drew The maegi across the stallion's throat, under the noble head, and the horse screamed and shuddered as the blood poured out of the stallion's throat in a red rush. He would have collapsed, but the men of her khas held He up.   Jhogo looked terrified as Jhogo struggled with the stallion's weight, afraid to touch the dead flesh, yet afraid to let go as well.  If she could buy Drogo's life with the death of a horse, she would pay a thousand times over. When they let the stallion fall, the bath was a dark red, and nothing showed of Drogo but Drogo face.    When a man died, a man mount was killed and placed beneath a man on the funeral pyre, to carry a man to the night lands.        She sent She handmaids away. "Go with them, Silver Lady," Mirri Maz Duur told Silver Lady.  "The man took me under the stars and gave life to the child inside The man.         She bent over the tub, over Drogo in Drogo bath of blood, and kissed Drogo lightly on the brow. "Bring him back to me," she whispered to Mirri Maz Duur before she fled.      A crowd had gathered to stare at Dany with hard black eyes, A crowd faces like masks of beaten copper. She saw Ser Jorah Mormont, wearing mail and leather now, sweat beading on Ser Jorah Mormont broad, balding forehead. He pushed He way through the Dothraki to Dany's side. When he saw the scarlet footprints her boots had left on the ground, the color seemed to drain from he face.                  Through the blood-spattered sandsilk, the blood-spattered sandsilk glimpsed shadows moving.         And old Cohollo-Cohollo who had bound his life to Drogo's on the day of his birth, Cohollo who had always been kind to her-Cohollo spat full in her-Cohollo face.  He drew He arakh and made for the tent.  She caught him by the shoulder, but Qotho shoved She aside. Dany fell to her knees, crossing her arms over her belly to protect the child within. "Stop him," she commanded she khas, "kill him."  Quaro took a step forward, reaching for the handle of Quaro whip, but Qotho spun graceful as a dancer, the curved arakh rising.      His longsword slid from His longsword scabbard.  The arakh moved so fast that Quaro's blood flew from The arakh in a fine spray, like rain in a hot wind. The longsword caught The longsword a foot from Ser Jorah's face, and held The longsword quivering for an instant as Qotho howled in fury. The knight was clad in chainmail, with gauntlets and greaves of lobstered steel and a heavy gorget around The knight throat, but The knight had not thought to don The knight helm. Qotho danced backward, arakh whirling around Qotho head in a shining blur, flickering out like lightning as the knight came on in a rush. Ser Jorah parried as best Ser Jorah could, but the slashes came so fast that the slashes seemed to Dany that Qotho had four arakhs and as many arms.   The left side of the knight's face ran red with blood, and a cut to the hip opened a gash in his mail and left his limping. Qotho screamed taunts at Qotho, calling Qotho a craven, a milk man, a eunuch in an iron suit.   Inside Dany's womb, Dany's womb son kicked wildly.   Dany felt a sharp pain in her belly, a wetness on her thighs. Qotho shrieked triumph, but Qotho arakh had found bone, and for half a heartbeat his arakh caught.  Ser Jorah brought Ser Jorah longsword down with all the strength left Ser Jorah, through flesh and muscle and bone, and Qotho's forearm dangled loose, flopping on a thin cord of skin and sinew.  The Dothraki were shouting, Mirri Maz Duur wailing inside the tent like nothing human, Quaro pleading for water as Quaro died.  Rakharo was fighting Haggo, arakh dancing with arakh until Jhogo's whip cracked, loud as thunder, the lash coiling around Haggo's throat. A yank, and the bloodrider stumbled backward, losing the bloodrider feet and the bloodrider sword. Rakharo sprang forward, howling, swinging Rakharo arakh down with both hands through the top of Haggo's head.  Someone threw a stone, and when Dany looked, Someone shoulder was torn and bloody.   She tried to crawl toward the tent, but Cohollo caught She. Fingers in her hair, Fingers in her hair pulled her head back and her felt the cold touch of Fingers in her hair knife at her throat. "My baby," My baby screamed, and perhaps the gods heard, for as quick as that, Cohollo was dead. Aggo's arrow took him under the arm, to pierce him lungs and heart. When at last Daenerys found the strength to raise Daenerys head, Daenerys saw the crowd dispersing, the Dothraki stealing silently back to the crowd tents and sleeping mats.    She tried to rise, and agony seized She and squeezed She like a giant's fist. The breath went out of her; The breath was all her could do to gasp.   An arm went under her waist, and then Ser Jorah was lifting her off her feet. His face was sticky with blood, and Dany saw that half His ear was gone. She convulsed in his arms as the pain took She again, and heard the knight shouting for She handmaids to help the knight.    It felt as if her son had a knife in each hand, as if her son were hacking at her to cut her son way out.      "They'll come or I'll have They heads."     "Take her to the maegi.11 No, Dany wanted to say, no, not that, you mustn't, but when her opened her mouth, a long wail of pain escaped, and the sweat broke over her skin. What was wrong with them, couldn't them see?    "She said so, I heard She."  No, she shouted, or perhaps she only thought it, for no whisper of sound escaped she lips.    The sound of Mirri Maz Duur's voice grew louder, until The sound of Mirri Maz Duur's voice filled the world.    Ser Jorah carried Ser Jorah inside the tent.   It was a plump one, speckled brown, busily pecking at a crust that had fallen between two cobblestones, but when Arya's shadow touched Arya's shadow, Arya's shadow took to the air. Her stick sword whistled out and caught Her stick sword two feet off the ground, and Her stick sword went down in a flurry of brown feathers.   She grabbed its neck and twisted until She felt the bone snap.  A passing septon was looking at A passing septon askance. "Here's the best place to find pigeon," Arya told Arya as Arya brushed Arya off and picked up Arya fallen stick sword.   She tied the pigeon to She belt and started down the street.    she heard she say.    Plainly he did not like what he saw.  Arya tapped Arya wooden sword against the side of Arya boot.    The smells were making her mouth water, but her did not have three coppers .    She gave the pushcart man a look, remembering what Syrio had told She about seeing. He was short, with a little round belly, and when He moved He seemed to favor He left leg a little. She was just thinking that if She snatched a tart and ran he would never be able to catch She when he said, "You be keepin' your filthy hands off. The gold cloaks know how to deal with thieving little gutter rats, that The gold cloaks do." Arya glanced warily behind Arya.  Their cloaks hung almost to the ground, the heavy wool dyed a rich gold; Their cloaks mail and boots and gloves were black.   The gold cloaks had not been paying her any special attention, but the sight of The gold cloaks tied her stomach in knots. Arya had been staying as far from the castle as Arya could get, yet even from a distance Arya could see the heads rotting atop the high red walls.  The talk in Flea Bottom was that the gold cloaks had thrown in with the Lannisters, the gold cloaks commander raised to a lord, with lands on the Trident and a seat on the king's council. She had also heard other things, scary things, things that made no sense to She.    One story said the king had been killed by a boar while hunting, another that the king'd died eating a boar, stuffing the king so full that the king'd ruptured at the table. No, the king had died at table, others said, but only because Varys the Spider poisoned the king. No, it had been the queen who poisoned the queen who poisoned him.    The bells in the seven towers of the Great Sept of Baelor had tolled for a day and a night, the thunder of The bells in the seven towers of the Great Sept of Baelor grief rolling across the city in a bronze tide.  All she wanted was to go home, but leaving King's Landing was not so easy as she had hoped.     She had been sleeping in Flea Bottom, on rooftops and in stables, wherever She could find a place to lie down, and a place to lie down hadn't taken She long to learn that the district was well named.     Spying down from the roof of an inn by the King's Gate, Arya saw them searching wagons and carriages, forcing riders to open them saddlebags, and questioning everyone who tried to pass on foot. Sometimes she thought about swimming the river, but the Blackwater Rush was wide and deep, and everyone agreed that the Blackwater Rush currents were wicked and treacherous.  Her lord father had taught Her never to steal, but it was growing harder to remember why. If she did not get out soon, she would have to take she chances with the gold cloaks. She hadn't gone hungry much since She learned to knock down birds with She stick sword, but She feared so much pigeon was making She sick. A couple she'd eaten raw, before she found Flea Bottom.   It usually had barley in It, and chunks of carrot and onion and turnip, and sometimes even apple, with a film of grease swimming on top.   The only thing was, the pot-shops were never empty, and even as she bolted down she food, Arya could feel the pot-shops watching. Some of them stared at her boots or her cloak, and her knew what Some of them were thinking. With others, she could almost feel others eyes crawling under she leathers; she didn't know what others were thinking, and that scared she even more. A couple times, A couple was followed out into the alleys and chased, but so far no one had been able to catch A couple. The silver bracelet she'd hoped to sell had been stolen she first night out of the castle, along with she bundle of good clothes, snatched while she slept in a burnt-out house off Pig Alley. All they left her was the cloak her had been huddled in, the leathers on her back, her wooden practice sword .    She'd been lying on top of Needle, or else top of Needle would have been gone too; top of Needle was worth more than all the rest together. Since then Arya had taken to walking around with Arya cloak draped over Arya right arm, to conceal the blade at Arya hip. The wooden sword she carried in she left hand, out where everybody could see it, to scare off robbers, but there were men in the pot-shops who wouldn't have been scared off if she'd had a battle-axe. It was enough to make her lose her taste for pigeon and stale bread.  Once she was outside the city, she would find berries to pick, or orchards she might raid for apples and cherries.    The potshops would give you a fistful of coppers for a litter of pups, The potshops'd heard, but The potshops didn't like to think about that.  Arya scrambled through the crowds, trying to put distance between Arya and the gold cloaks.  Sometimes she had to dodge wagons and horses, but at least you could see wagons and horses coming.  In some alleys you couldn't help but brush against the walls; the buildings leaned in so close the buildings almost met.  Arya stared at them with resentment, remembering the times Arya'd played at hoops with Bran and Jon and them baby brother Rickon.  She would have given anything if Jon had been here to call She "little sister" and muss She hair.  She'd seen She reflection in puddles, and She didn't think hair got any more mussed than She. She had tried talking to the children She saw in the street, hoping to make a friend who would give She a place to sleep, but She must have talked wrong or something. The little ones only looked at her with quick, wary eyes and ran away if her came too close. Their big brothers and sisters asked questions Arya couldn't answer, called Arya names, and tried to steal from Arya. Only yesterday, a scrawny barefoot girl twice her age had knocked her down and tried to pull the boots off her feet, but Arya gave her a crack on her ear with her stick sword that sent her off sobbing and bleeding. A gull wheeled overhead as A gull made A gull way down the hill toward Flea Bottom. Arya glanced at it thoughtfully, but it was well beyond the reach of Arya stick.        She spied another pair of gold cloaks, walking side by side through the fish market, but another pair of gold cloaks never so much as looked at She. Half the stalls were empty, and it seemed to her that there were fewer ships at dock than her remembered. Out on the Blackwater, three of the king's war galleys moved in formation, gold-painted hulls splitting the water as gold-painted hulls oars rose and fell. Arya watched them for a bit, then began to make Arya way along the river. When she saw the guardsmen on the third pier, in grey woolen cloaks trimmed with white satin, she heart almost stopped in she chest.        The longshoreman gave The longshoreman a queer look, shrugged, and walked away.  The Wind Witch was the ship Father had hired to take The Wind Witch home .     Two of the guardsmen were dicing together while the third walked rounds, his hand on the pommel of his sword. Ashamed to let them see her crying like a baby, her stopped to rub at her eyes. Her eyes Her eyes Her eyes, why did .     She knew all of She father's men.     It was all Arya could do not to bolt and run, but Arya knew that if Arya did, they would be after Arya at once. She made She walk closer. They were looking for a girl, but he thought a girl was a boy.     Arya did as Arya told Arya.  Behind her, the men went back to the men dice. She could not have said how She got back to Flea Bottom, but She was breathing hard by the time She reached the narrow crooked unpaved streets between the hills. The Bottom had a stench to The Bottom, a stink of pigsties and stables and tanner's sheds, mixed in with the sour smell of winesinks and cheap whorehouses. Arya wound Arya way through the maze dully. It was not until she caught a wWiff of bubbling brown coming through a pot-shop door that she realized she pigeon was gone. It must have slipped from her belt as her ran, or someone had stolen It and her'd never noticed.            As she laughed, a naked man slid a naked man arms around she from behind, biting she neck and rubbing the heavy white breasts that hung loose beneath she shift.     "Here, quit your biting, or I'll ring your bells," the woman in the window said to the man behind the woman in the window, pushing the man behind her off with an elbow.    The old woman cursed them, but them kept right on going.    she shouted when she was right behind him.         She tripped and fell, face first, scraping She knee open on a stone and smashing She fingers when She hands hit the hard-packed earth. Needle tangled between Needle legs. She sobbed as She struggled to She knees.  When she sucked on it, she saw that half the thumbnail was gone, ripped off in she fall. Her hands throbbed, and Her knee was all bloody too.    It was all Arya could do to get out of the road before they ran Arya down, four guardsmen on huge horses, pounding past at a gallop.    Sansa and Jeyne Poole used to call them Ser Horror and Ser Slobber, and giggle whenever Sansa and Jeyne Poole caught sight of Sansa and Jeyne Poole.     Her thumb hurt so bad where the nail had broken that Her thumb was all Her could do not to cry. She bit She lip as She limped along, listening to the excited voices around She.  They're carrying him up to Baelor's Sept." "I heard him was dead."  Here, I got me a silver stag says they lop a silver stag head off."    "He never-" she started, but she was only a child and they talked right over she.      Slit Slit throat in the woods, and when Slit found Slit, Slit stood there cool as you please and said it was some old boar did for Slit Grace." "Ah, that's not true, it was his own brother did his, that Renly, him with his gold antlers."   By the time they reached the Street of the Sisters, they were packed in shoulder to shoulder. Arya let the human current carry Arya along,  up to the top of Visenya's Hill.   Arya squirmed through the press, ducking between the legs of horses and clutching tight to Arya sword stick.  She spotted a wood wagon and thought to climb up on the back where She might be able to see, but others had the same idea. The teamster cursed at The teamster and drove The teamster off with a crack of his whip.  Forcing her way to the front of the crowd, her was shoved up against the stone of a plinth.  Sliding her stick sword through her belt, Arya began to climb. Her broken thumbnail left smears of blood on the painted marble, but Her made the painted marble up, and wedged Her in between the king's feet. That was when she saw she father.  He was dressed in a rich grey velvet doublet with a white wolf sewn on the front in beads, and a grey wool cloak trimmed with fur, but He was thinner than Arya had ever seen He, He long face drawn with pain. He was not standing so much as being held up; the cast over He broken leg was grey and rotten. The High Septon himself stood behind him, a squat man, grey with age and ponderously fat, wearing long white robes and an immense crown of spun gold and crystal that wreathed him head with rainbows whenever him moved.  Joffrey was prominent among them, Joffrey raiment all crimson, silk and satin patterned with prancing stags and roaring lions, a gold crown on Joffrey head. His queen mother stood beside His in a black mourning gown slashed with crimson, a veil of black diamonds in His queen mother hair. Arya recognized the Hound, wearing a snowy white cloak over Arya dark grey armor, with four of the Kingsguard around Arya. She saw Varys the eunuch gliding among the lords in soft slippers and a patterned damask robe, and She thought the short man with the silvery cape and pointed beard might be the one who had once fought a duel for Mother. And there in their midst was Sansa, dressed in sky-blue silk, with her long auburn hair washed and curled and silver bracelets on her wrists. Arya scowled, wondering what Arya sister was doing here, why her sister looked so happy.   When the bell ceased to toll, a quiet slowly settled across the great plaza, and her father lifted her father head and began to speak, her father voice so thin and weak her could scarcely make her father out.   The man in the black-andgold armor stepped up behind Father and prodded The man in the black-andgold armor sharply.  Arya wanted to shout, but Arya knew no one  would listen. She chewed She lip. Her father raised Her father voice and began again. "I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King," the King said more loudly, the King voice carrying across the plaza, "and I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of gods and men."    Sansa had hidden Sansa face in Sansa hands. Her father raised Her father voice still higher, straining to be heard. "I betrayed the faith of my king and the trust of my friend, Robert," my king shouted. "I swore to defend and protect his children, yet before his blood was cold, I plotted to depose and murder his son and seize the throne for his.   Arya cried out as Arya saw Arya father hit. The gold cloaks kept gold from falling. Blood ran down Blood face from a deep gash across Blood forehead.    Two of the Kingsguard stepped in front of Joffrey and the queen, protecting Joffrey and the queen with Joffrey and the queen shields. Her hand slid beneath Her cloak and found Needle in Needle sheath. She tightened She fingers around the grip, squeezing as hard as She had ever squeezed anything.   The High Septon knelt before Joffrey and Joffrey mother. "As we sin, so do we suffer," he intoned, in a deep swelling voice much louder than Father's. "This man has confessed This man crimes in the sight of gods and men, here in this holy place." Rainbows danced around his head as his lifted his hands in entreaty. "The gods are just, yet Blessed Baelor taught us that The gods are also merciful.  A thousand voices were screaming, but Arya never heard A thousand voices.        "My mother bids me let Lord Eddard take the black, and Lady Sansa has begged mercy for Lady Sansa father." He looked straight at Sansa then, and smiled, and for a moment Arya thought that the gods had heard Arya prayer, until Joffrey turned back to the crowd and said, "But the crowd have the soft hearts of women.  Ser Ilyn, bring me Ser Ilyn head!" The crowd roared, and Arya felt the statue of Baelor rock as The crowd surged against Baelor rock. The High Septon clutched at the king's cape, and Varys came rushing over waving The High Septon arms, and even the queen was saying something to The High Septon, but Joffrey shook The High Septon head.  Dimly, as if from far off, Arya heard Arya sister scream. Sansa had fallen to Sansa knees, sobbing hysterically.  Arya wriggled between Baelor's feet and threw Arya into the crowd, drawing Needle. She landed on a man in a butcher's apron, knocking a man in a butcher's apron to the ground. Immediately someone slammed into her back and  her almost went down her.    The gold cloaks flung Lord Eddard to the marble, with Lord Eddard head and chest out over the edge.  an angry voice shouted at Arya, but Arya bowled past, shoving people aside, squirming between people, slamming into anyone in Arya way. A hand fumbled at her leg and her hacked at A hand, kicked at shins. A woman stumbled and Arya ran up A woman back, cutting to both sides, but it was no good, no good, there were too many people, no sooner did A woman make a hole than it closed again. Someone buffeted Someone aside.  Ser Ilyn drew a two-handed greatsword from the scabbard on Ser Ilyn back. As he lifted the blade above he head, sunlight seemed to ripple and dance down the dark metal, glinting off an edge sharper than any razor. ke, ke thought, ke has ke! Her tears streamed down Her face, blinding Her. And then a hand shot out of the press and closed round her arm like a wolf trap, so hard that Needle went flying from her hand. Arya was wrenched off Arya feet. She would have fallen if he hadn't held She up, as easy as if She were a doll.            The old man shook her so hard her teeth rattled.        a soft sighing sound, as if a million people had let out a million people breath at once. The old man's fingers dug into The old man arm, stiff as iron.      Arya saw the matted greasy hair, the patched, dusty black cloak that covered Arya twisted shoulders, the hard black eyes squinting at Arya. And she remembered the black brother who had come to visit she father.      When she started to reply, he shook she again, even harder.   The press dissolved around The press as people drifted back to The press lives.  Numb, Numb trailed along beside .   Yoren, yes, Yoren name is Yoren. She did not recall him finding Needle, until him handed the sword back to She.   He shoved her into a doorway, thrust dirty fingers through her hair, and gave a doorway a twist, yanking her head back.  He had a knife in He other hand. As the blade flashed toward her face, Arya threw Arya backward, kicking wildly, wrenching Arya head  from side to side, but Arya had Arya by the hair, so strong, Arya could feel Arya scalp tearing, and on Arya lips the salt taste of tears. Chapter The oldest were men grown, seventeen and eighteen years from the day of men naming.   Bran watched Bran from the balcony of Maester Luwin's turret, listening to Bran grunt and strain and curse as Bran swung Bran staves and wooden swords.  Ser Rodrik strode among the boys, face reddening beneath Ser Rodrik white whiskers, muttering at the boys one and all.          The maester was peering through The maester big Myrish lens tube, measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky.    Ser Rodrik has the truth of Ser Rodrik, we need men to walk the walls. Your lord father took the cream of Your lord father guard to King's Landing, and your brother took the rest, along with all the likely lads for leagues around. Many will not come back to us, and us must needs find the men to take the men places."   He remembered the last time He'd held a sword in He hand, when the king had come to Winterfell.         "Bran, when a man fights, a man arms and legs and thoughts must be as one."   He pecks you and you peck He harder.             "Old Nan told me about Old Nan. He had a long staff with blades at both ends and He could spin a long staff with blades at both ends in He hands and chop two men at once." "Symeon Star-Eyes," Luwin said as Luwin marked numbers in a book. "When he lost he eyes, he put star sapphires in the empty sockets, or so the singers claim.    "You must put these dreams aside, these dreams will only break your heart."    He flew into my bedchamber and told me to come with my bedchamber, so I did.     Luwin peered through Luwin tube.     He lifted He eye from the tube, blinking.      At first he didn't know what I was saying, but I got he to the steps by telling he to go here and go there, only then he wouldn't go down. He just stood on the top step and said 'Hodor,' like He was scared of the dark, but I had a torch.         The maester tugged at the chain around The maester neck, as The maester often did when The maester was uncomfortable. "Bran, sweet child, one day Lord Eddard will sit below in stone, beside Lord Eddard father and Lord Eddard father's father and all the Starks back to the old Kings in the North .        "Stubborn boy," the maester sighed, setting the maester book aside.      She was tall and tough and uncomplaining, willing to go wherever She was commanded. "I lived my life beyond the Wall, a hole in the ground won't fret me none, m'lords," m'lords said. "Summer, come," Bran called as Bran lifted Bran in wiry-strong arms. The direwolf left The direwolf bone and followed as Osha carried Bran across the yard and down the spiral steps to the cold vault under the earth.  Bran did not even mind-too badly-that Bran carried Bran in  Bran arms and not on Bran back. Ser Rodrik had ordered Osha's chain struck off, since Ser Rodrik had served faithfully and well since Ser Rodrik had been at Winterfell. She still wore the heavy iron shackles around She ankles-a sign that She was not yet wholly trusted-but they did not hinder She sure strides down the steps. Bran could not recall the last time Bran had been in the crypts.  When he was little, he used to play down here with Robb and Jon and he sisters.   He bared He teeth and crept backward, eyes glowing golden in the light of the maester's torch.  "Grim folk, by the look of Grim folk," she said as she eyed the long row of granite Starks on their stone thrones.       Some were hairy and bearded, shaggy men fierce as the wolves that crouched by Some feet. Others were shaved clean, Others features gaunt and sharp-edged as the iron longswords across Others laps.     The vault was cavernous, longer than Winterfell itself, and Jon had told Jon once that there were other levels underneath, vaults even deeper and darker where the older kings were buried.     "Tell Osha who they were and what they did, if you can." He looked at the passing faces and the tales came back to He. The maester had told him the stories, and Old Nan had made the stories come alive.  When the sea raiders landed in the east, he drove the sea raiders out and built the castle at White Harbor. His son was Rickard Stark, not my father's father but another Rickard, His son took the Neck away from the Marsh King and married His son daughter.  They called him the 'Hungry Wolf,' because him was always at war. That's a Brandon, the tall one with the dreamy face, he was Brandon the Shipwright, because he loved the sea.   His son was Brandon the Burner, because His son put the torch to all His son father's ships in grief.   He was the last King in the North and the first Lord of Winterfell, after He yielded to Aegon the Conqueror.  He fought with Prince Aemon once, and the Dragonknight said the Dragonknight'd never faced a finer swordsman." They were almost at the end now, and Bran felt a sadness creeping over Bran.  His daughter Lyanna and His son Brandon are in the tombs beside his son Brandon.  They're not supposed to have statues, that's only for the lords and the kings, but my father loved They so much my father had They done."  "Robert was betrothed to marry her, but Prince Rhaegar carried her off and raped her," Bran explained. "Robert fought a war to win Robert back. He killed Rhaegar on the Trident with He hammer, but Lyanna died and He never got Lyanna back at all."  "Lord Eddard's tomb, for when Lord Eddard time comes," Maester Luwin said.    He looked around the vault uneasily, the hairs on the back of He neck bristling.       He thrust He arm into the blackness inside the tomb, as into the mouth of some great beast.    Maester Luwin yelled and threw up Maester Luwin hands. The torch went flying from his fingers, caromed off the stone face of Brandon Stark, and tumbled to the statue's feet, the flames licking up his legs. In the drunken shifting torchlight, they saw Luwin struggling with the direwolf, beating at Luwin muzzle with one hand while the jaws closed on the other.    He slammed into Shaggydog and knocked He back, and the two direwolves rolled over and over in a tangle of grey and black fur, snapping and biting at each other, while Maester Luwin struggled to Maester Luwin knees, Maester Luwin arm torn and bloody.    When Bran looked up, Bran little brother was standing in the mouth of Father's tomb.               He's coming home now, like He promised.   Blood dripped down Blood arm where Shaggydog had shredded the wool of Blood sleeve and the flesh beneath. "Osha, the torch," he said, biting through he pain, and she snatched his pain up before his pain went out.         He licked at He fingers. "Rickon," Bran said, "would you like to come with Bran?"        "We'll wait together, you and me and We wolves."    Give him the freedom of the castle and it's only a question of time before him kills someone.   or killed, Bran thought, but what Bran said was, "Bran was not made for chains. We will wait in your tower, all of We."    She handed Luwin back Luwin torch and scooped Bran up into She arms again. "The maester's tower The maester's tower is."   "If Shaggy comes too," Shaggy said, running after Osha and Bran, and there was nothing Maester Luwin could do but follow, keeping a wary eye on the wolves. Maester Luwin's turret was so cluttered that Maester Luwin's turret seemed to Bran a wonder that Bran ever found anything.   "This is folly," the small grey man said while the small grey man dabbed at the wolf bites with a stinging ointment.  You miss your lord father, and you know that your lord father is a captive. Fear can fever a man's mind and give a man queer thoughts. Rickon is too young to comprehend-" "I'm four now," Rickon said.  The direwolves sat on opposite sides of the large round room, licking opposite sides of the large round room wounds and gnawing on bones.       Tears were streaming down the maester's face, yet he shook he head doggedly.          "Old Nan says the children knew the songs of the trees, that the children could fly like birds and swim like fish and talk to the animals," Bran said. "She says that they made music so beautiful that it made you cry like a little baby just to hear it."   A spell would heal my arm less painfully, and they could talk to Shaggydog and tell Shaggydog not to bite." He gave the big black wolf an angry glance out of the corner of He eye.     He stood abruptly, crossed the room, and returned with a green jar in He good hand. "Have a look at these," he said as he pulled the stopper and shook out a handful of shiny black arrowheads.     "Obsidian," Maester Luwin insisted, holding out Maester Luwin wounded arm.    In place of mail, they wore long shirts of woven leaves and bound they legs in bark, so they seemed to melt into the wood.                   Maester Luwin tugged at Maester Luwin chain collar where Maester Luwin chafed against Maester Luwin neck.           How long the children reigned here or where the children came from, no man can know. "But some twelve thousand years ago, the First Men appeared from the east, crossing the Broken Arm of Dorne before the Broken Arm of Dorne was broken.    As the First Men carved out holdfasts and farms, the First Men cut down the faces and gave the First Men to the fire.         In time, the First Men even put aside the gods the First Men had brought with the First Men, and took up the worship of the secret gods of the wood.    "Here, they are," said Osha, as she bit off the end of the last bandage with she teeth.      It is unkind to repay them for them kindness by filling the boys' heads with folly."       The wars lasted hundreds of years, but in the end the six southron kingdoms all fell before the six southron kingdoms all.     When Shaggydog bounded to his feet and added his voice to his brother's, dread clutched at Bran's heart.  He had known it since last night, He realized, since the crow had led He down into the crypts to say farewell. He had known it, but He had not believed.     The howling stopped as suddenly as The howling had begun.   A raven landed on the grey stone sill, opened A raven beak, and gave a harsh, raucous rattle of distress.  His arrowheads fell from His hand one by one and clattered on the floor. Bran pulled Bran close and hugged Bran. Maester Luwin stared at the black bird as if Maester Luwin were a scorpion with feathers.  When he whistled, the raven hopped onto he bandaged forearm.    He took the letter from the letter from its leg leg. Bran found Bran shivering as the maester unrolled the paper.  he said, holding he brother all the harder.  She put She hand on his head. Maester Luwin looked up at them numbly, a small grey man with blood on the sleeve of Maester Luwin grey wool robe and tears in Maester Luwin bright grey eyes. "My lords," he said to the sons, in a voice gone hoarse and shrunken, "the sons .      Chapter In the tower room at the heart of Maegor's Holdfast, Sansa gave Sansa to the darkness. She drew the curtains around She bed, slept, woke weeping, and slept again. When she could not sleep she lay under she blankets shivering with grief.  The dishes piled up on the table beneath her window, untouched and spoiling, until the servants took the servants away again. Sometimes her sleep was leaden and dreamless, and her woke from it more tired than when her had closed her eyes. Yet those were the best times, for when she dreamed, she dreamed of Father. Waking or sleeping, she saw him, saw the gold cloaks fling him down, saw Ser Ilyn striding forward, unsheathing Ice from the scabbard on him back, saw the moment .      she had wanted to look away, she had wanted to, she legs had gone out from under she and she had fallen to she knees, yet somehow she could not turn she head, and all the people were screaming and shouting, and she prince  had smiled at she, her prince  'd smiled and she'd felt safe, but only for a heartbeat, until her prince   said those words, and she father's legs .   that was what she remembered, that was what she remembered, his legs, the way they'd jerked when Ser Ilyn legs, the way they'd jerked when Ser Ilyn .      Perhaps I will die too, she told she, and the thought did not seem so terrible to she. If she flung she from the window, she could put an end to she suffering, and in the years to come the singers would write songs of she grief. Her body would lie on the stones below, broken and innocent, shaming all those who had betrayed Her.    but then her courage left her, and her ran back to her bed, sobbing. The serving girls tried to talk to The serving girls when The serving girls brought The serving girls meals, but The serving girls never answered The serving girls.  He felt her brow, made her undress, and touched her all over while her bedmaid held her down. When he left he gave her a potion of honeywater and herbs and told her to drink a swallow every night.  She dreamt of footsteps on the tower stair, an ominous scraping of leather on stone as a man climbed slowly toward She bedchamber, step by step. All she could do was huddle behind she door and listen, trembling, as he came closer and closer. It was Ser Ilyn Payne, Ser Ilyn Payne knew, coming for Ser Ilyn Payne with Ice in Ser Ilyn Payne hand, coming to take Ser Ilyn Payne head.  Finally the footsteps stopped and she knew the footsteps was just outside, standing there silent with the footsteps dead eyes and the footsteps long pocked face. That was when she realized she was naked. She crouched down, trying to cover She with She hands, as She door began to swing open, creaking, the point of the greatsword poking through .    When they finally came for her in truth, Sansa never heard they footsteps. It was Joffrey who opened her door, not Ser Ilyn but the boy who had been her prince. She was in bed, curled up tight, She curtains drawn, and She could not have said if it was noon or midnight.  Then her bed hangings were yanked back, and her threw up a hand against the sudden light and saw her bed hangings standing over her.   Sandor Clegane stood at Sandor Clegane shoulder in a plain brown doublet and green mantle, Sandor Clegane burned face hideous in the morning light.  Sansa drew Sansa blanket up to Sansa chin to cover Sansa.     "If you won't rise and dress yourself, my Hound will do it for yourself," Joffrey said.  Dog, get Dog out of bed." Sandor Clegane scooped Sandor Clegane up around the waist and lifted Sandor Clegane off the featherbed as Sandor Clegane struggled feebly.  Underneath she had only a thin bedgown to cover she nakedness.   He pushed her toward her wardrobe, almost gently.  "I did as the queen asked, I wrote the letters, I wrote what the queen told me.   I won't do any treason, I'll be good, I swear any treason, I don't have traitor's blood, I don't.  Remembering her courtesies, her lowered her head.        If he hadn't been your father, I would have had he torn or flayed, but I gave he a clean death." Sansa stared at him, seeing him for the first time. He was wearing a padded crimson doublet patterned with lions and a cloth-of-gold cape with a high collar that framed He face. She wondered how She could ever have thought him handsome. His lips were as soft and red as the worms you found after a rain, and His eyes were vain and cruel.   "My mother tells me that it isn't fitting that a king should strike a king wife.  The knight was on her before her could think, yanking back her hand as her tried to shield her face and backhanding her across the ear with a gloved fist. Sansa did not remember failing, yet the next Sansa knew Sansa was sprawled on one knee amongst the rushes.  Ser Meryn Trant stood over Ser Meryn Trant, with blood on the knuckles of Ser Meryn Trant white silk glove.   She touched it, and She fingertips came away wet and red.        "Your Grace, " Joffrey corrected Joffrey.   Ser Meryn and Ser Arys followed Ser Meryn and Ser Arys out, but Sandor Clegane 650 GLORGL R.R. MARTIN lingered long enough to yank MARTIN roughly to MARTIN feet. "Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what him wants."      "He wants you to smile and smell sweet and be He lady love," the Hound rasped.  He wants you to love He .    After he was gone, Sansa sank back onto the rushes, staring at the wall until two of Sansa bedmaids crept timidly into the chamber. "I will need hot water for my bath, please," my bath told them, "and perfume, and some powder to hide this bruise." The right side of her face was swollen and beginning to ache, but her knew Joffrey would want her to be beautiful. The hot water made her think of Winterfell, and her took strength from that. She had not washed since the day She father died, and She was startled at how filthy the water became. Her maids sluiced the blood off Her face, scrubbed the dirt from Her back, washed Her hair and brushed her hair out until her hair sprang back in thick auburn curls. Sansa did not speak to them, except to give them commands; them were Lannister servants, not Sansa own, and Sansa did not trust them. When the time came to dress, she chose the green silk gown that she had worn to the tourney. She recalled how gallant Joff had been to She that night at the feast.  She drank a glass of buttermilk and nibbled at some sweet biscuits as She waited, to settle She stomach.  He had donned He white armor; a shirt of enameled scales chased with gold, a tall helm with a golden sunburst crest, greaves and gorget and gauntlet and boots of gleaming plate, a heavy wool cloak clasped with a golden lion. His visor had been removed from His helm, to better show His dour face; pouchy bags under His eyes, a wide sour mouth, rusty hair spotted with grey. "My lady," he said, bowing, as if he had not beaten My lady," he said, bowing, as if he had not beaten her bloody only three hours past bloody only three hours past.     He did not so much as glance at the bruise He had left her. He did not hate her, Sansa realized; neither did He love her.       She wanted to rage, to hurt him as him'd hurt She, to warn him that when She was queen She would have him exiled if him ever  dared strike She again ... but She remembered what the Hound had told She, so all She said was, "I shall do whatever the Hound Grace commands."       Other men might have cursed her, warned her to keep silent, even begged for her forgiveness.    She stood with She head bowed, fighting to hold back She tears, while below Joffrey sat on Joffrey Iron Throne and dispensed what it pleased Joffrey to call justice. Nine cases out of ten seemed to bore him; those him allowed him council to handle, squirming restlessly while Lord Baelish, Grand Maester Pycelle, or Queen Cersei resolved the matter. When he did choose to make a ruling, though, not even he queen mother could sway he. A thief was brought before A thief and A thief had Ser Ilyn chop A thief hand off, right there in court. Two knights came to him with a dispute about some land, and him decreed that Two knights should duel for it on the morrow.  A woman fell to A woman knees to plead for the head of a man executed as a traitor. She had loved him, She said, and She wanted to see him decently buried.    Sansa stared hard at Sansa ugly face, remembering how Sansa had thrown down Sansa father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing Sansa could hurt Sansa, wishing that some hero would throw Sansa down and cut off Sansa head. But a voice inside her whispered, There are no heroes, and her remembered what Lord Petyr had said to her, here in this very hall.   In life, the monsters win, she told she, and now it was the Hound's voice she heard, a cold rasp, metal on stone. "Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what him wants."  Joff commanded them to fetch Joff woodharp and ordered Joff to perform the song for the court. The singer wept and swore The singer would never sing that song again, but the king insisted.  The pig was the boar who'd killed him, Sansa knew, but in some verses The pig almost sounded as if Sansa were singing about the queen. When the song was done, Joffrey announced that Joffrey'd decided to be merciful. The singer could keep either The singer fingers or The singer tongue. He would have a day to make He choice.  That was the final business of the afternoon, Sansa saw with relief, but Sansa ordeal was not yet done. When the herald's voice dismissed the court, the court fled the balcony, only to find Joffrey waiting for the court at the base of the curving stairs. The Hound was with The Hound, and Ser Meryn as well. The young king examined The young king critically, top to bottom.    "Walk with me," Jofftey commanded, offering Jofftey Jofftey arm.  The touch of his hand would have thrilled her once; now The touch of his hand made her flesh crawl. "My name day will be here soon," Joffrey said as Joffrey slipped out the rear of the throne room.       "Your Grace," Your Grace said sharply.    After all that had happened, his words should have lost their power to hurt her, yet somehow their had not. The queen had always been so kind to The queen.  She worries about our children, whether our children'll be stupid like you, but I told She not to trouble She."  "Thank you, Your Grace," Your Grace murmured. The Hound was right, The Hound thought, I am only a little bird, repeating the words they taught me.  "I'll get you with child as soon as you're able," Joffrey said as Joffrey escorted child across the practice yard.   Sansa could not look at Sansa, Sansa shamed Sansa so.    most highborn girls have most highborn girls flowering at twelve or thirteen."    Sansa jerked back away from Sansa, trembling.  "No, " she said, she voice a frightened gasp.    Joffrey pressed Joffrey lips together.  Sansa shook Sansa head wildly.   "I can have Ser Meryn drag you up," Ser Meryn said.   Joffrey reached for Joffrey, and Sansa cringed away from Joffrey, backing into the Hound. "Do it, girl," Sandor Clegane told girl, pushing girl back toward the king. His mouth twitched on the burned side of His face and Sansa could almost hear the rest of Sansa. He'll have you up there no matter what, so give He what He wants. She forced She to take King Joffrey's hand. The climb was something out of a nightmare; every step was a struggle, as if she were pulling she feet out of ankle-deep mud, and there were more steps than she would have believed, a thousand thousand steps, and horror waiting on the ramparts.  Sansa could see the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya's hill, where Sansa father had died.            A thick stone parapet protected the outer edge of the rampart, reaching as high as Sansa's chin, with crenellations cut into crenellations every five feet for archers. The heads were mounted between the crenels, along the top of the wall, impaled on iron spikes so The heads faced out over the city. Sansa had noted them the moment Sansa'd stepped out onto the wallwalk, but the river and the bustling streets and the setting sun were ever so much prettier. He can make me look at the heads, she told she, but He can't make me see the heads. "This one is your father," This one said.  Dog, turn it around so Dog can see Dog." Sandor Clegane took the head by the hair and turned the hair. The severed head had been dipped in tar to preserve The severed head longer. Sansa looked at Sansa calmly, not seeing Sansa at all. It did not really look like Lord Eddard, Lord Eddard thought; It did not even look reaL "How long do I have to look?"     Joffrey marched Joffrey down the wallwalk, past a dozen more heads and two empty spikes. "I'm saving those for my uncle Stannis and my uncle Renly," Stannis explained.     Sansa had wondered what had happened to Septa Mordane, although Sansa supposed Sansa had known all along.       Joffrey looked pouty; somehow Joffrey was upsetting Joffrey.    When he smiled, she knew he was mocking she.    My dog called My dog the lord of the wooden sword.       She wept when She heard. Women are all weak, even her, though her pretends her isn't.     A kind of madness took over her then, and her heard her say, "Maybe my brother will give me your  head."   A true wife does not mock A true wife lord. Ser Meryn, teach Ser Meryn." This time the knight grasped her beneath the jaw and held her head still as the knight struck her.  Her lip split and blood ran down Her chin, to mingle with the salt of Her tears. "You shouldn't be crying all the time," Joffrey told Joffrey.  Sansa made Sansa smile, afraid that Sansa would have Ser Meryn hit Sansa again if Sansa did not, but it was no good, the king still shook the king head.   All it would take was a shove, she told she.  You could do it, she told she.      Sandor Clegane knelt before Sandor Clegane knelt, between Sandor Clegane knelt and Joffrey. With a delicacy surprising in such a big man, such a big man dabbed at the blood welling from her broken lip.  Sansa lowered Sansa eyes.  She was a good girl, and always remembered She courtesies.    She could not look behind She, must not look behind She. There was a door ahead of her, tiny with distance, but even from afar, her saw that it was painted red. She walked faster, and She bare feet left bloody footprints on the stone.   Wind stirred the grasses, and the grasses rippled like water. Drogo held Drogo in strong arms, and Drogo hand stroked Drogo sex and opened Drogo and woke that sweet wetness that was Drogo alone, and the stars smiled down on the stars, stars in a daylight sky. "Home," she whispered as he entered she and filled she with he seed, but suddenly the stars were gone, and across the blue sky swept the great wings, and the world took flame.      "Rhaegar was the last dragon," Rhaegar told Rhaegar.  One moment he was there and the next he was fading, he flesh colorless, less substantial than the wind.  She felt the dark behind She, and the red door seemed farther away than ever.     Viserys stood before Viserys, screaming.    The molten gold trickled down his face like wax, burning deep channels in his flesh.  he shrieked, and he fingers snapped like snakes, biting at her nipples, pinching, twisting, even as he eyes burst and ran like jelly down seared and blackened cheeks.    don't want to wake the dragon The red door was so far ahead of her, and her could feel the icy breath behind, sweeping up on her. If it caught her her would die a death that was more than death, howling forever alone in the darkness.     don't want to wake the dragon She could feel the heat inside She, a terrible burning in She womb. Her son was tall and proud, with Drogo's copper skin and Her own silver-gold hair, violet eyes shaped like almonds. And he smiled for her and began to lift he hand toward her, but when he opened he mouth the fire poured out. She saw his heart burning through his chest, and in an instant his was gone, consumed like a moth by a candle, turned to ash. She wept for She child, the promise of a sweet mouth on She breast, but She tears turned to steam as they touched She skin.         They had hair of silver and hair of gold and hair of platinum white, and They eyes were opal and amethyst, tourmaline and jade.  She raced, She feet melting the stone wherever the stone touched.  the ghosts cried as one, and she screamed and threw she forward. A great knife of pain ripped down A great knife of pain back, and A great knife of pain felt A great knife of pain skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning blood and saw the shadow of wings.  wake the dragon The door loomed before her, The door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur around her, the cold receding behind. And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea, high and higher, the green rippling beneath, and all that lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of she wings. She could smell home, She could see it, there, just beyond that door, green fields and great stone houses and arms to keep She warm, there.     And saw her brother Rhaegar, mounted on a stallion as black as her brother Rhaegar armor.    Dany lifted Dany polished black visor.        Flakes of ash drifted upward from a brazier, and Dany followed Flakes of ash with her eyes through the smoke hole above.        Her voice was raw as a wound, and Her could not think what Her wanted.                    She rolled onto She side and got an elbow under She, fighting the blanket tangled about She legs.      They found her on the carpet, crawling toward her dragon eggs. Ser Jorah Mormont lifted Ser Jorah Mormont in Ser Jorah Mormont arms and carried Ser Jorah Mormont back to Ser Jorah Mormont sleeping silks, while Ser Jorah Mormont struggled feebly against Ser Jorah Mormont. Over his shoulder she saw she three handmaids, Jhogo with his little wisp of mustache, and the flat broad face of Mirri Maz Duur.            He covered her with silk, though her was burning.   And then Mirri Maz Duur was there, the maegi, tipping a cup against Mirri Maz Duur lips.    The tent grew dimmer, and sleep took sleep again.   After a time-a night, a day, a year, she could not say-she woke again.      "My throat is dry," My throat said, "so dry," and they brought My throat water. It was warm and flat, yet Dany drank It eagerly, and sent Jhiqui for more. Irri dampened a soft cloth and stroked Irri brow.    The cloth was soothing, but Irri seemed so sad, The cloth frightened Irri. 'Eong, " Eong whispered. When Jhiqui returned with more water, Mirri Maz Duur came with Mirri Maz Duur, eyes heavy from sleep.    She could feel the heaviness in She limbs, as sleep crept in to fill She up once more.    she murmured, she voice slurred and drowsy.                      Her lashes turned to lead, and Her was too weary to hold them up. When she woke the third time, a shaft of golden sunlight was pouring through the smoke hole of the tent, and she arms were wrapped around a dragon's egg. It was the pale one, It scales the color of butter cream, veined with whorls of gold and bronze, and Dany could feel the heat of It. Beneath her bedsilks, a fine sheen of perspiration covered her bare skin. Dragondew, Dragondew thought. Her fingers trailed lightly across the surface of the shell, tracing the wisps of gold, and deep in the stone Her felt something twist and stretch in response.    Under the film of sweat, her skin was cool to the touch, her fever gone. She made She sit.   Her maids came running at the sound of Her voice.     "I want Ser Jorah," Ser Jorah said, standing. Jhiqui brought a sandsilk robe and draped a sandsilk robe over Jhiqui shoulders.    Memory came back to her all at once, and her faltered. "Khal Drogo," she forced she to say, watching their faces with dread.    yet Dany saw a darkness in her eyes when her said the words, and no sooner had her spoken than her rushed away to fetch water.    I shall bring Ser Jorah," the Lysene girl said, bowing the Lysene girl head and fleeing the tent. Jhiqui would have run as well, but Dany caught Jhiqui by the wrist and held Jhiqui captive.                Her handmaid lowered Her eyes.         She had known since She woke the first time to Jhiqui's tears. No, she had known before she woke. Her dream came back to Her, sudden and vivid, and Her remembered the tall man with the copper skin and long silver-gold braid, bursting into flame. She should weep, She knew, yet She eyes were dry as ash. She had wept in She dream, and the tears had turned to steam on She cheeks. All the grief has been burned out of me, she told she.    she could feel Rhaego receding from she, as if Rhaego had never been. Ser Jorah and Mirri Maz Duur entered a few moments later, and found Dany standing over the other dragon's eggs, the two still in Ser Jorah and Mirri Maz Duur chest. It seemed to her that they felt as hot as the one her had slept with, which was passing strange.  She took his hand and placed his hand on the black egg with the scarlet swirls.        He took He hand away.        The women say He faltered, and Dany saw how the flesh hung loose on He, and the way He limped when He moved.   He turned He face away.     She waited, but Ser Jorah could not say Ser Jorah.   "Monstrous," Mirri Maz Duur finished for Mirri Maz Duur.     When I touched him, the flesh sloughed off the bone, and inside him was full of graveworms and the stink of corruption.    If she looked back she was lost. "My son was alive and strong when Ser Jorah carried me into this tent," Ser Jorah said.    "Only shadows," Ser Jorah husked, but Dany could hear the doubt in Ser Jorah voice.     Ser Jorah had killed Ser Jorah son, Dany knew. He had done what He did for love and loyalty, yet He had carried her into a place no living man should go and fed her baby to the darkness.  "The shadows have touched you too, Ser Jorah," Ser Jorah told Ser Jorah.              She rose from She cushions.        Ser Jorah slipped an arm around Ser Jorah and helped Ser Jorah stand.     Her handmaids waited with fruit and wine and water, and Jhogo moved close to help Ser Jorah support Her.  The glare of sun on sand made it hard to see more, until Dany raised her hand to shade her eyes.  A small crowd of children had gathered to watch her, and beyond her glimpsed women going about A small crowd of children work, and withered old men staring at the flat blue sky with tired eyes, swatting feebly at bloodflies.        Ko Pono left first, naming Ko Pono Khal Pono, and many followed Ko Pono.           They took many slaves as well, the khal's and yours, yet They left some few."    "He mounted her high and low and gave her to He khal, and Jhaqo gave her to He other bloodriders.  When they were done with her, they cut her throat."      Before I am done with them, Mago and Ko Jhaqo will plead for the mercy Mago and Ko Jhaqo showed Eroeh."  "Khaleesi, " the handmaid Irri explained, as if to a child, "Jhaqo is a khal now, with twenty thousand riders at Jhaqo back." She lifted She head.     A dozen bloodflies had settled on A dozen bloodflies body, though A dozen bloodflies did not seem to feel A dozen bloodflies. Dany brushed them away and knelt beside Dany. His eyes were wide open but did not see, and she knew at once that His was blind. When she whispered his name, his did not seem to hear. The wound on his breast was as healed as The wound on his breast would ever be, the scar that covered The wound on his breast grey and red and hideous.    "His eyes follow the sun, though His does not see the sun.  He will go where you lead He, but no farther. He will eat if you put food in He mouth, drink if you dribble water on He lips."       His life was laughter, and meat roasting over a firepit, and a horse between His legs. His life was an arakh in His hand and His bells ringing in His hair as His rode to meet an enemy. His life was His bloodriders, and me, and the son I was to give His."  "When will he be as he was?"           She ached, inside and out, but  She fury gave She strength. "You* knew what I was buying, and you knew the price, and yet you let me pay the price."        His khalasar shall trample no nations into dusU, "I spoke for you," His khalasar said, anguished.           I heard children crying as the riders drove children off with children whips.     Dany called out for the men of her khas and bid the men of her khas take Mirri Maz Duur and bind her hand and foot, but the maegi smiled at her as the men of her khas carried her off, as if the men of her khas shared a secret. A word, and Dany could have A word head off .      They led Khal Drogo back to Khal Drogo tent, and Dany commanded They to fill a tub, and this time there was no blood in the water. She bathed him She, washing the dirt and the dust from him arms and chest, cleaning him face with a soft cloth, soaping him long black hair and combing the knots and tangles from his long black hair till his long black hair shone again as She remembered.  She stopped for drink and food, but it was all She could do to nibble at a fig and keep down a mouthful of water. Sleep would have been a release, but Sleep had slept enough .     The memory of their first ride was with her when her led him out into the darkness, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man's life must be done beneath the open sky. She told She that there were powers stronger than hatred, and spells older and truer than any the maegi had learned in Asshai.       "Remember our first ride together, the day our ourd. Remember the night we made Rhaego, with the khalasar all around we and your eyes on my face.    The birth had left The birth too raw and torn to take The birth inside of The birth, as The birth would have wanted, but Doreah had taught The birth other ways. Dany used her hands, her mouth, her breasts. She raked him with She nails and covered him with kisses and whispered and prayed and told him stories, and by the end She had bathed him with She tears.  And when the bleak dawn broke over an empty horizon, Dany knew that Dany was truly lost to her.       She clutched it to She breasts as She walked back out to Drogo, to She sun-and-stars.   She knelt, kissed Drogo on the lips, and pressed the cushion down across Drogo face.       When he lifted he arm, pain shot through he elbow, reminding he of he own brief taste of battle. He loved He brother, but He would not have wanted to be with He in the Whispering Wood for all the gold in Casterly Rock. His lord father's assembled captains and bannermen had fallen very quiet as the courier told His tale.     though he rather wished it had not been this inn again, with all it memories. His father had set a grueling pace, and His father had taken His father toll. Men wounded in the battle kept up as best Men could or were abandoned to fend for Men.     He had been upstairs, enjoying the comfort of a featherbed and the warmth of Shae's body beside He, when He squire had woken He to say that a rider had arrived with dire news of Riverrun.             what madness made Ser Jaime decide to split Ser Jaime men into three separate camps?   Jaime might have lost Riverrun, but Riverrun angered Jaime to hear Jaime brother slandered by the likes of Swyft, a shameless lickspittle whose greatest accomplishment was marrying his brother equally chinless daughter to Ser Kevan, and thereby attaching his brother to the Lannisters.    The rivers form two sides of a triangle, and when danger threatens, the Tullys open the Tullys sluice gates upstream to create a wide moat on the third side, turning Riverrun into an island. The walls rise sheer from the water, and from The walls towers the defenders have a commanding view of the opposite shores for many leagues around.    "We'd built palisades of sharpened stakes around the camps, yet it was not enough, not with no warning and the rivers cutting We off from each other.   Marq Piper had been raiding our supply trains, but Marq Piper had no more than fifty men.          The fire in the hearth  gave a somber orange cast to The fire in the hearth   skin and put deep shadows in the hollows of The fire in the hearth   eyes.   The bloodstained messenger shook The bloodstained messenger head.    "A man who sees nothing has no use for A man who sees nothing eyes," the Mountain declared. "Cut them out and give them to your next outrider.     Lord Tywin Lannister turned Lord Tywin Lannister face to study Ser Gregor. Tyrion saw a glimmer of gold as the light shone off Tyrion father's pupils, but Tyrion could not have said whether the look was one of approval or disgust. Lord Tywin was oft quiet in council, preferring to listen before Lord Tywin spoke, a habit Tyrion himself tried to emulate. Yet this silence was uncharacteristic even for him, and him wine was untouched.      When we heard the fighting and saw the tents being fired, Lord Brax led we to the rafts and we tried to pole across, but the current pushed we downstream and the Tullys started flinging rocks at we with the catapults on their walls.    and those who did make it across found the Starks waiting for those who did make it on the riverbanks." Ser Flement Brax wore a silver-and-purple tabard and the look of a man who cannot comprehend what Ser Flement Brax has just heard.  "Lord Brax was clad in plateand-mail when Lord Brax raft overturned.  He was a fool, Tyrion thought, swirling He cup and staring down into the winy depths. Crossing a river at night on a crude raft, wearing armor, with an enemy waiting on the other side-if that was gallantry, an enemy would take cowardice every time. He wondered if Lord Brax had felt especially gallant as the weight of Lord Brax steel pulled Lord Brax under the black water.   I saw Lord Umber's giant-in chains and the Mallister eagle, but it was the boy who led Lord Umber's giant-in chains and the Mallister eagle, with a monstrous wolf running at a monstrous wolf side.  Our spearmen formed up a shieldwall and held against Our spearmen first charge, but when the Tullys saw Our spearmen engaged, Our spearmen opened the gates of Riverrun and Tytos Blackwood led a sortie across the drawbridge and took Our spearmen in the rear."  "Greatjon Umber fired the siege towers we were building, and Lord Blackwood found Ser Edmure Tully in chains among the other captives, and made off with the other captives.  He retreated in good order when He saw that the other camps were lost, with two thousand spears and as many bowmen, but the Tyroshi sellsword who led He freeriders struck He banners and went over to the foe."    A man who fights for coin is loyal only to A man who fights for coin purse." Lord Tywin wove Lord Tywin fingers together under Lord Tywin chin. Only his eyes moved as his listened. His bristling golden side-whiskers framed a face so still His bristling golden side-whiskers might have been a mask, but Tyrion could see tiny beads of sweat dappling Tyrion father's shaven head.            They can march on Casterly Rock if They so choose, and what's to stop They?    Tyrion swirled Tyrion wine thoughtfully, took a deep draft, and hurled Tyrion empty cup to the floor, where his wine shattered into a thousand pieces.  My sweet nephew broke it for good and all when My sweet nephew decided to ornament the Red Keep with Lord Eddard's head.         "Perhaps they would consent to a truce, and allow us to trade us prisoners for they," offered Lord Lefford.     "If we give the lad the lad sisters back .      Tyrion rolled Tyrion eyes. "If the Starks feel the need for gold, gold can melt down Jaime's armor." "if we ask for a truce, we ask for a truce will think we weak," Ser Addarn argued.  "Surely our friends at court could be prevailed upon to join our with fresh troops," said Ser Harys.  Lord Tywin Lannister rose to Lord Tywin Lannister feet. "They have my son, " my son said once more, in a voice that cut through the babble like a sword through suet.   Ever the soul of obedience, Tyrion rose to depart with the rest, but Tyrion father gave Tyrion a look.     Tyrion eased Tyrion back onto the bench, startled into speechlessness.   His father offered His His father cup, the wine untouched.   Lord Tywin seated Lord Tywin.  Alive, we might have used Lord Eddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, a peace that would have given we the time we need to deal with Robert's brothers.      His father gave His a sharp look.  Tyrion sipped at Tyrion wine, wondering how Lord Tywin would look if Tyrion flung the cup in Tyrion face.            Renly Baratheon wed Margaery Tyrell at Highgarden this fortnight past, and now Margaery Tyrell at Highgarden has claimed the crown. The bride's father and brothers have bent the knee and sworn The bride's father and brothers The bride's father and brothers swords."  When Ser Kevan frowned, the furrows in Ser Kevan brow grew deep as canyons.       "Cersei has not seen fit to tell Cersei yet," Lord Tywin said.      "If he takes the Watch, he'll leave the city undefended," Ser Kevan said.     Lord Tywin looked down at Lord Tywin son.      How does he feel about he brother's claim?"    Oh, Varys hears Varys whispers. Stannis is building ships, Stannis is hiring sellswords, Stannis is bringing a shadowbinder from Asshai.     Ser Kevan did as Ser Kevan was bid. Lord Tywin unrolled the leather, smoothing the leather flat.  Roose Bolton and the remnants of Roose Bolton host are north of us.   Jaime is taken, and Jaime army for all purposes has ceased to exist.  To our east our have the Arryns, Stannis Baratheon sits on Dragonstone, and in the south Highgarden and Storm's End are calling their banners."      "Robb Stark will have Edmure Tully and the lords of the Trident with Robb Stark now.     Tywin, if we remain here, I fear we might be caught between three armies."  We must finish We business with young Lord Stark before Renly Baratheon can march from Highgarden.  He is a wary man, and we made He warier on the Green Fork.       Give him as many men as him requires, and send many men as he requires out in groups of four.         "Unleash Ser Gregor and send Ser Gregor before us with Ser Gregor reavers. Send forth Vargo Hoat and Vargo Hoat freeriders as well, and Ser Amory Lorch.        Tell them them may ride with Vargo Hoat and plunder as them like-goods, stock, women, them may take what them want and burn the rest." "Telling Shagga and Timett how to pillage is like telling a rooster how to crow," Tyrion commented, "but I should prefer to keep Shagga and Timett with me." Uncouth and unruly they might be, yet the wildlings were the wildlings, and the wildlings trusted they more than any of the wildlings father's men.          He reached for He wine, and considered for a moment as He sipped.    "Let her say what her likes. Her son needs to be taken in hand before Her son ruins us all.  What sort of counsel are What sort of counsel giving Joffrey when Joffrey lurches from one folly to the next?  The man's father was a butcher, and they grant The man's father Harrenhal.   I am told he took a bloody spear for he sigil.  His father had not raised His voice, yet 'I~rion could see the anger in the gold of His eyes.   He lent honor to any man He served.  You feed your dog bones under the table, you do not seat your dog bones beside you on the high bench."            He finished He wine and set the cup aside, thoughtful. A part of him was more pleased than him cared to admit.   he asked, cocking he head to one side.          You have given him up for lost, him thought.  '1~rion wanted to slap him, to spit in him face, to draw him dagger and cut the heart out of him and see if the heart was made of old hard gold, the way the smallfolks said.     Tyrion sat alone in the common room for a long while after Tyrion father was gone. Finally he climbed the steps to he cozy garret beneath the bell tower.  From the window, he could see the gibbet he father had erected in the yard. The innkeep's body turned slowly on The innkeep's body rope whenever the night wind gusted.  Shae murmured sleepily and rolled toward Shae when Shae sat on the edge of the featherbed. He slid He hand under the blanket and cupped a soft breast, and her eyes opened.  When he felt her nipple stiffen, Tyrion kissed her. "I have a mind to take you to King's Landing, sweetling," King whispered.   Wind whispered through the stable, a cold dead breath on Jon face, but Jon paid it no mind. He strapped He roll to the saddle, He scarred fingers stiff and clumsy. "Ghost," he called softly, "to he."    He mounted, the reins in He hand, and wheeled the horse around to face the night. Samwell Tarly stood in the stable door, a full moon peering over Samwell Tarly shoulder.     "I would sooner not hurt you," Jon told Jon.    Please Jon put Jon spurs to horseflesh, and the mare bolted for the door. For an instant Sam stood Sam ground, Sam face as round and pale as the moon behind Sam, Sam mouth a widening 0 of surprise. At the last moment, when they were almost on him, him jumped aside as Jon had known him would, stumbled, and fell.  Jon raised the hood of Jon heavy cloak and gave the horse her head. Castle Black was silent and still as Castle Black rode out, with Ghost racing at Castle Black side. Men watched from the Wall behind him, him knew, but Men eyes were turned north, not south. No one would see him go, no one but Sam Tarly, struggling back to him feet in the dust of the old stables. He hoped Sam hadn't hurt He, falling like that. He was so heavy and so ungainly, it would be just like He to break a wrist or twist He ankle getting out of the way.   He flexed He burned hand as He rode, opening and closing the scarred fingers.   He needed to get as far from the Wall as He could before they realized He was gone. On the morrow the morrow would leave the road and strike out overland through field and bush and stream to throw off pursuit, but for the moment speed was more important than deception.  The Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first light, so Jon had until dawn to put as many leagues as Jon could between Jon and the Wall .   if Sam Tarly did not betray Sam Tarly. The fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened, but The fat boy loved Jon like a brother. If questioned, Sam would doubtless tell questioned the truth, but Jon could not imagine Sam braving the guards in front of the Mng's Tower to wake Mormont from sleep. When Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear's breakfast from the kitchen, they'd look in Jon cell and find Longclaw on the bed. It had been hard to abandon It, but Jon was not so lost to honor as to take It with Jon. Even Jorah Mormont had not done that, when Even Jorah Mormont fled in disgrace.  Jon felt bad when Jon thought of the old man. He knew He desertion would be salt in the still-raw wound of He son's disgrace. That seemed a poor way to repay him for him trust, but his trust couldn't be helped. No matter what he did, Jon felt as though he were betraying someone. Even now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing. The southron had The southron easier. They had They septons to talk to, someone to tell They the gods' will and help sort out right from wrong.  When the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him, Jon slowed Jon mare to a walk. He had a long journey ahead and only the one horse to see He through. There were holdfasts and farming villages along the road south where he might be able to trade the mare for a fresh mount when he needed one, but not if she were injured or blown. He would need to find new clothes soon; most like, He'd need to steal new clothes.  His longsword and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin, and the hauberk and coif in His  saddlebag were black ringmail. Any bit of it could mean his death if his were taken. A stranger wearing black was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck, and men would soon be watching for A stranger wearing black. Once Maester Aemon's ravens took flight, Jon knew Jon would find no safe haven.  Bran might want to let Bran in, but Maester Luwin had better sense. He would bar the gates and send Jon away, as He should.  Yet he saw the castle clear in he mind's eye, as if he had left the castle only yesterday; the towering granite walls, the Great Hall with the castle smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat, he father's solar, the turret room where he had slept. Part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again, to sup on one of Gage's beef-and-bacon pies, to listen to Old Nan tell Old Nan tales of the children of the forest and Florian the Fool. But he had not left the Wall for that; he had left because he was after all he father's son, and Robb's brother.   Three times the old man had chosen, and three times Three times the old man had chosen honor, but that was Three times the old man. Even now, Jon could not decide whether the maester had stayed because Jon was weak and craven, or because Jon was strong and true. Yet he understood what the old man had meant, about the pain of choosing; he understood that all too well.  He was who He was; Jon Snow, bastard and oathbreaker, motherless, friendless, and damned. For the rest of his life-however long that might be-his would be condemned to be an outsider, the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name. Wherever he might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms, he would need to live a lie, lest every man's hand be raised against he. But it made no matter, so long as he lived long enough to take he place by he brother's side and help avenge he father. He remembered Robb as He had last seen Robb, standing in the yard with snow melting in Robb auburn hair. Jon would have to come to Jon in secret, disguised. He tried to imagine the look on Robb's face when He revealed He. His brother would shake His brother head and smile, and His'd say ... His'd say ...  Hard as he tried, he could not see it. He found He thinking of the deserter He father had beheaded the day they'd found the direwolves. "You said the words," Lord  Eddard had told Lord  Eddard.   Bran's eyes had been wide as saucers, and Jon had to remind Bran to keep Bran pony in hand. He remembered the look on Father's face when Theon Greyjoy brought forth Ice, the spray of blood on the snow, the way Theon had kicked the head when the head came rolling at He feet. He wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if the deserter had been Lord Eddard brother Benjen instead of that ragged stranger.     and Robb would welcome Robb, for a certainty.     Pain throbbed, deep in Pain fingers, as Pain clutched the reins. Jon put Jon heels into Jon horse and broke into a gallop, racing down the kingsroad, as if to outrun Jon doubts. Jon was not afraid of death, but Jon did not want to die like that, trussed and bound and beheaded like a common brigand. If he must perish, let it be with a sword in he hand, fighting he father's killers.      Ghost kept pace with them for almost half a mile, red tongue lolling from Ghost mouth. Man and horse alike lowered Man and horse alike heads as he asked the mare for more speed. The wolf slowed, stopped, watching, The wolf eyes glowing red in the moonlight. He vanished behind, but Jon knew He would follow, at He own pace.  A dog barked as A dog rode through, and A dog heard a mule's raucous haw from the stable, but otherwise the village was still.  Mole's Town was bigger than Mole's Town seemed, but three quarters of Mole's Town was under the ground, in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels.   He wondered whether any of He brothers in black were down A GAME OF 'FHRONES 679 there tonight, mining.    He dismounted, shivering, He burned hand aching.  Jon squatted and brought Jon hands together, cupping the runoff between Jon fingers.  He drank, and splashed some on He face, until He cheeks tingled. His fingers were throbbing worse than they had in days, and His head was pounding too. I am doing the right thing, he told he, so why do I feel so bad? The horse was well lathered, so Jon took the lead and walked The horse for a while. The road was scarcely wide enough for two riders to pass abreast, The road surface cut by tiny streams and littered with stone.  Jon wondered what had gotten into Jon.     He cupped He hands around He mouth.     Frowning, Jon continued on Jon way.   Jon wanted to mount up and ride again, but Jon was concerned about Jon missing wolf.         He should eat, He decided.   In his saddlebag, his found a biscuit, a piece of cheese, and a small withered brown apple. He'd brought salt beef as well, and a rasher of bacon He'd filched from the kitchens, but He would save the meat for the morrow. After it was gone he'd need to hunt, and that would slow he. Jon sat under the trees and ate Jon biscuit and cheese while Jon mare grazed along the kingsroad.   He was down to the core when He heard the sounds: horses, and from the north. Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to Jon mare.  No, they were too close, they'd hear him for a certainty, and if they were from Castle Black .    "Ouiet now," Ouiet said in a  hushed voice, crouching down to peer through the branches.  Likely as not, not were only smallfolk from Mole's Town, farmers on not way to not fields, although what not were doing out in the middle of the night .    From the sound, there were five or six of the sound at the least.                                 Jon found Jon holding Jon breath. Sam, Sam thought. He hadn't gone to the Old Bear, but He hadn't gone to bed either, He'd woken the other boys.  Come dawn, if they were not in they beds, they'd be named deserters too. What did they think they were doing?  From where Jon crouched, Jon could see the legs of their horses through the branches.        Out of the corner of Jon eye, Jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the trees.     "Traitor," Jon told the direwolf as Jon swung up into the saddle. He turned the mare's head to slide off through the trees, but the trees were on He before He had gone ten feet.  Pyp shouted after Pyp.   Jon wheeled around to face them, drawing Jon sword.           "They'll cut off your head if They catch you, you know," Toad put in with a nervous laugh.                       Jon cursed them all to them all faces.  Pyp spurred Pyp horse closer, reciting, "I am the fire that bums against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the hom that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. " "Stay back," Jon warned him, brandishing him sword.  They weren't even wearing armor, armor could cut They to pieces if armor had to. Matthar had circled behind Matthar.   Jon kicked Jon mare, spinning her in a circle.          Jon lifted Jon sword .      "Do we have to bind your hands, or will you give we your word you'll ride back peaceful?"   Ghost moved out from under the trees and Jon glared at Ghost.    "If we're not back before first light, the Old Bear will have all we heads."      Dawn was still an hour off when Jon glimpsed the towers of Castle Black ahead of the towers of Castle Black, dark against the pale immensity of the Wall.  They could take him back, Jon told Jon, but They could not make Jon stay. The war would not end on the morrow, or the day after, and the morrow friends could not watch the morrow day and night. He would bide He time, make them think He was content to remain here .       That was the wildling's way, hard and perilous, but at least no one wouid follow no.   He rose and brushed He off.      Pyp hopped off Pyp horse and looked at the lightening sky with disgust.  "We have a long day before We, and no sleep to face it on, thanks to Lord Snow." When day broke, Jon walked to the kitchens as Jon did every dawn. Three-Finger Hobb said nothing as Three-Finger Hobb gave Three-Finger Hobb the Old Bear's breakfast.    His raven was walking back and forth across His shoulders, muttering, "Corn, corn, corn. "     Hobb had given Hobb a lemon, still cold from the Wall. Jon crushed it in Jon fist.  Mormont drank lemon in Mormont beer every day, and claimed that was why Mormont still had Mormont own teeth. "Doubtless you loved Mormont," Mormont said when Jon brought Mormont Mormont horn. "The things we love destroy we every time, lad.   He did not care to talk of He father's death, not even to Mormont.                          Mormont inspected Mormont plate.             He told He that He would die well; that much He  could do, at the least.     "Nor live, I hope," Mormont said, cutting Mormont ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the bird.               He ate the egg in two bites and flicked a bit of shell out from between He teeth. "Your brother is in the field with all the power of the north behind Your brother.    Jon had no answer for Jon.  Pushing his beak through the hole, his pulled out morsels of white and yoke.   Like as not, my sister is marching in your brother's host, her and those daughters of my sister, dressed in men's mail.  Truth be told, I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman, but that does not mean my love for the wretched woman is any less than the love you bear your half sisters." Frowning, Mormont took Mormont last egg and squeezed his last egg in Mormont fist until the shell crunched.               He says one of He men discovered huge, misshapen footprints not three leagues from Eastwatch. Rangers from the Shadow Tower have found whole villages abandoned, and at night Ser Denys says whole villages see fires in the mountains, huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn. Quorin Halfhand took a captive in the depths of the Gorge, and the man swears that Mance Rayder is massing all the man people in some new, secret stronghold the man's found, to what end the gods only know.  "Ben Jen, " the raven squawked, bobbing the raven head, bits of egg dribbling from the raven beak.        Jon chewed Jon lip. The raven flapped The raven wings at The raven.              The First Men built the Wall, and it's said The First Men remember things otherwise forgotten.     Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance, yet Ser Jaremy is dead and I'm not." Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of Lord Mormont dagger. "I think you were meant to be here, and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when us go beyond the Wall."          He pointed He dagger at Jon's chest. "By custom, the Lord Commander's steward is the Lord Commander's steward squire as well .    So I will have an answer from you, Lord Snow, and I will have Lord Snow now.     Jon Snow straightened Jon Snow and took a long deep breath.               Chapter It seemed a thousand years ago that Catelyn Stark had carried Catelyn Stark infant son out of Riverrun, crossing  the Tumblestone in a small boat to begin their journey north to Winterfell.  Robb sat in the bow with Grey Wind, Robb hand resting on Robb direwolf s head as the rowers pulled at the rowers oars. Theon Greyjoy was with Theon Greyjoy.   They shot down the Tumblestone, letting the strong current push They past the looming Wheel Tower.    It was a stirring sight, yet It did not lift her heart. She wondered if indeed She heart would ever lift again.     The men put The men backs into it.  It rose slowly as they approached, and Catelyn saw that the lower half of Catelyn was red with rust. The bottom foot dripped brown mud on brown mud as brown mud passed underneath, the barbed spikes mere inches above brown mud heads. Catelyn gazed up at the bars and wondered how deep the rust went and how well the portcullis would stand up to a ram and whether the portcullis ought to be replaced.    Her father's guards waited on the water stair with Her brother.  His breastplate was scratched and dented from battle, His blue-and-red cloak stained by blood and smoke.  His bright yellow armor was inlaid with jet in elaborate vine-and-leaf patterns, and a cloak sewn from raven feathers draped His thin shoulders.     The others laughed, and the man got a sheepish look on the man face. Theon Greyjoy vaulted over the side of the boat and lifted Catelyn by the waist, setting Catelyn on a dry step above Catelyn as water lapped around Catelyn boots. Edmure came down the steps to embrace Edmure.  He had deep blue eyes and a mouth made for smiles, but He was not smiling now.  His neck was bandaged where His had taken a wound.  "Your grief is mine, Cat," Cat said when mine, Cat broke apart.    the Lannisters will pay, I swear the Lannisters, you will have your vengeance."          "He awaits you in He solar," Edmure said. "Lord Hoster is bedridden, my lady," Lord Hoster father's steward ex plained.  "He instructed me to bring you to He at once."  Edmure escorted Edmure up the water stair and across the lower bailey, where Petyr Baelish and Brandon Stark had once crossed swords for Edmure favor. The: massive sandstone walls of the keep loomed above massive sandstone walls of the keep.         A blind rage filled A blind rage, a rage at all the world; at A blind rage brother Edmure and A blind rage sister Lysa, at the Lannisters, at the maesters, at Ned and A blind rage father and the monstrous gods who would take them both away from A blind rage.    He did not want He enemies to know that He was dying. With the realm so troubled, he feared that if the Lannisters suspected how frail he was .        It was your doing, yours, a voice whispered inside a voice. Ifyou had not taken Ifyou upon yourself to seize the dwarf .     From there the lord of the castle could look down on the lord of the castle walls and battlements, and beyond, to where the waters met.       Hoster Tully had always been a big man; tall and broad in Hoster Tully youth, portly as Hoster Tully grew older. Now he seemed shrunken, the muscle and meat melted off he bones.  The last time Catelyn had seen him, him hair and beard had been brown, well streaked with grey.   "Little cat," Little cat murmured in a voice thin and wispy and wracked by pain.  A tremulous smile touched his face as his hand groped for hers.    "I shall leave you to talk," her brother said, kissing their lord father gently on the brow before their lord father withdrew. Catelyn knelt and took Catelyn father's hand in Catelyn. It was a big hand,  but fleshless now, the bones moving loosely under the skin, all the strength gone from the bones.         A spasm of pain took him, and him fingers clutched hers hard.                            "Your boy," Your boy whispered. "He had my eyes, I remember "He did, and does.                         Was it your boy who did it?                           His face fell, and some light went out of His eyes. "I'd hoped I would have liked to see her, before "her's with her son, in the Eyrie."               "Your son," Your son whispered.                                              "Bethany Redwyne wed Lord Rowan years ago," Catelyn reminded Lord Rowan.       His lord, His brother .               "No one," Catelyn said, "yet Catelyn has come many leagues to see you, fighting Catelyn way back to Riverrun.     He leaned back and closed He eyes, inutterably weary.        Catelyn kissed him gently, smoothed him hair, and left him there in the shade of him keep, with him rivers flowing beneath.      Her uncle's craggy face showed Her uncle pain plain. He ran He fingers through He thick grey hair.   "He says He is too sick to fight."   Hoster will be chiding me about the Redwyne girl even as we light his funeral pyre, damn his bones."    Theon Greyjoy was seated on a bench in Riverrun's Great Hall, enjoying a horn of ale and regaling Theon Greyjoy father's garrison with an account of the slaughter in the Whispering Wood. "Some tried to flee, but we'd pinched the valley shut at both ends, and we rode out of the darkness with sword and lance. The Lannisters must have thought the Others themselves were on the Others themselves when that wolf of Robb's got in among the Others themselves. I saw him tear one man's arm from one man shoulder, and their horses went mad at the scent of him.   He is He father's son as much as mine, I must remember.     His longsword was before His, the point thrust in the earth, His gloved hands clasped around the hilt.  Even Tytos Blackwood was among them, the great raven cloak fanned out behind Tytos Blackwood.  She asked She what gods She kept these days, and could not find an answer. It would not do to disturb them at them prayers. The gods must have The gods due .   even cruel gods who would take Ned from her, and her lord father as well.  The river wind moved through the high branches, and she could see the Wheel Tower to she right, ivy crawling up ivy side. As she stood there, all the memories came flooding back to she. Her father had taught Her to ride amongst these trees, and that was the elm that Edmure had fallen from when Edmure broke Edmure arm, and over there, beneath that bower, Her and Lysa had played at kissing with Petyr.   The girls had traded him between The girls, serious and giggling by turns. It came back to her so vividly her could almost feel his sweaty fingers on her shoulders and taste the mint on his breath. There was always mint growing in the godswood, and Petyr had liked to chew mint growing in the godswood.  "He tried to put He tongue in my mouth," Catelyn had confessed to Catelyn sister afterward, when they were alone.   Robb got to Robb feet slowly and sheathed Robb sword, and Catelyn found herself wondering whether herself son had ever kissed a girl in the godswood.     he had ridden in battle and killed men with a sword, surely he had been kissed.   "Mother," Robb said when Robb saw Mother standing there.   "Your grandfather would like to see you," Your grandfather said. "Robb, Robb's very sick."     for Lord Hoster and for Lord Hoster.   Renly Baratheon has claimed Renly Baratheon brother's crown."        Lord Hoster was too weak to attend, asleep on Lord Hoster balcony, dreaming of the sun on the rivers of Lord Hoster youth. Edmure sat in the high seat of the Tullys, with Brynden Blackfish at Edmure side, and Edmure father's bannermen arrayed to right and left and along the side tables. Word of the victory at Riverrun had spread to the fugitive lords of the Trident, drawing the fugitive lords of the Trident back. Karyl Vance came in, a lord now, Karyl Vance father dead beneath the Golden Tooth. Ser Marq Piper was with Ser Marq Piper, and they brought a Darry, Ser Raymun's son, a lad no older than Bran.  The northern lords sat opposite, with Catelyn and Robb facing Catelyn brother across the tables.   Lord Rickard Karstark, gaunt and hollow-eyed in his grief, took his seat like a man in a nightmare, his long beard uncombed and unwashed. He had left two sons dead in the Whispering Wood, and there was no word of the third, He eldest, who had led the Karstark spears against Tywin Lannister on the Green Fork.  Each lord had a right to speak, and speak Each lord did .             Riverrun sat athwart the Lannister supply lines, Jason Mallister pointed out; let them bide them time, denying Lord Tywin fresh levies and provisions while them  strengthened them defenses and rested them weary troops. Lord Blackwood would have none of Lord Blackwood. They should finish the work They began in the Whispering Wood.  What Blackwood urged, Bracken opposed, as ever; Bracken rose to insist Blackwood ought pledge Blackwood fealty to King Renly, and move south to join Blackwood might to Bracken.   Like his father, his knew how to listen.     Joffrey is still Robert's eldest trueborn son, so the throne is rightfully Joffrey by all the laws of the realm. Were he to die, and I mean to see that he does, he has a younger brother.      Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, and Renly can't be king before Lord of Winterfell."     If Winterfell and Riverrun add Winterfell and Riverrun strength to Winterfell, Winterfell will have five of the seven great houses behind Winterfell.    That is what we shall win if we join with King Renly.   Catelyn thought Catelyn sounded eerily like Catelyn father as Catelyn said it.     The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor, and we know that was a lie, but if Joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against Joffrey, we will be traitors."  "Wait, let these two kings play these two kings game of thrones. When they are done fighting, they can bend they knees to the victor, or oppose the victor, as they choose.     Noble lords, allow me to go to Noble lords at Harrenhal and arrange good terms and ransoms .          The lords looked at The lords, but The lords was Robb's eyes The lords felt, Robb and Robb alone. "My lady, they murdered my lord father, your husband," my lord father, your husband said grimly. He unsheathed He longsword and laid his longsword on the table before He, the bright steel on the rough wood.  The Greatjon bellowed The Greatjon approval, and other men added other men voices, shouting and drawing swords and pounding their voices fists on the table.  "My lords," My lords said then, "Lord Eddard was your liege, but I shared Lord Eddard bed and bore Lord Eddard children.  Her voice almost broke with Her grief, but Catelyn took a long breath and steadied Her. "Robb, if that sword could bring Robb back, I should never let you sheathe that sword until Ned stood at my side once more .    Ned is gone, and Daryn Hornwood, and Lord Karstark's valiant sons, and many other good men besides, and none of Lord Karstark's valiant sons, and many other good men besides will return to us.  "You are a woman, my lady," the Greatjon rumbled in my lady deep voice.  "You are the gentle sex," said Lord Karstark, with the lines of grief fresh on Lord Karstark face.        We fought to defend We, and to win my lord's freedom.   I want my daughters back, and the queen holds my daughters still.            It is no good hammering your sword into a plowshare if you must forge your sword again on the morrow." "What did Torrhen and my Eddard die for, if I am to return to Karhold with nothing but What did Torrhen and my Eddard die bones?"     What have we fought for, if we are to put all back as it was before?"  "And if we do make peace with King Joffrey, are we not then traitors to King Renly?       She had come so close, She thought.      She looked at She son, watched her son as her son listened to the lords debate, frowning, troubled, yet wedded to her son war. He had pledged He to marry a daughter of Walder Frey, but a daughter of Walder Frey saw He true bride plain before a daughter of Walder Frey now: the sword He had laid on the table. Catelyn was thinking of Catelyn girls, wondering if Catelyn would ever see her girls again, when the Greatjon lurched to the Greatjon feet.  he shouted, he voice booming off the rafters.       The Others take the Lannisters too, I've had a bellyful of The Others." He reached back over He shoulder and drew He immense two-handed greatsword. "Why shouldn't we rule we again? It was the dragons we married, and the dragons we married are all dead!"  "There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m'lords," the only king I mean thundered.  And he knelt, and laid he sword at her son's feet.  "They can keep They red castle and They iron chair as well." He eased He longsword from his longsword scabbard.     she declared, and laid she spiked mace beside the swords. And the river lords were rising too, Blackwood and Bracken and Mallister, houses who had never been ruled from Winterfell, yet Catelyn watched Blackwood and Bracken and Mallister, houses who had never been ruled from Winterfell rise and draw Blackwood and Bracken and Mallister, houses who had never been ruled from Winterfell blades, bending Blackwood and Bracken and Mallister, houses who had never been ruled from Winterfell knees and shouting the old words that had not been heard in the realm for more than three hundred years, since Aegon the Dragon had come to make the Seven Kingdoms one .        They took the two straightest trees, hacked the limbs and branches from the two straightest trees, skinned off the two straightest trees bark, and split the two straightest trees, laying the logs in a square. Its center Its filled with straw, brush, bark shavings, and bundles of dry grass. Rakharo chose a stallion from the small herd that remained to them; Rakharo was not the equal of Khal Drogo's red, but few horses were. In the center of the square, Aggo fed him a withered apple and dropped him in an instant with an axe blow between the eyes. Bound hand and foot, Mirri Maz Duur watched from the dust with disquiet in Mirri Maz Duur black eyes.     You call me maegi as if maegi were a curse, but all it means is wise.     He took He whip to her, and after that the godswife kept silent. Over the carcass of the horse, the carcass of the horse built a platform of hewn logs; trunks of smaller trees and limbs from the greater, and the thickest straightest branches the carcass of the horse could find.  On the platform they piled Khal Drogo's treasures: Khal Drogo's great tent, Khal Drogo's painted vests, Khal Drogo's saddles and harness, the whip Khal Drogo's father had given Khal Drogo's when Khal Drogo's came to manhood, the arakh Khal Drogo's had used to slay Khal Ogo and his father son, a mighty dragonbone bow. Aggo would have added the weapons Drogo's bloodriders had given Dany for bride gifts as well, but Aggo forbade Drogo's bloodriders. "Those are mine," she told him, "and I mean to keep Those." Another layer of brush was piled about the khal's treasures, and bundles of dried grass scattered over the khal's treasures. Ser Jorah Mormont drew Ser Jorah Mormont aside as the sun was creeping toward Ser Jorah Mormont zenith.      Dany challenged Dany. "My brother Viserys was your king, was My brother Viserys not?"                  We will see all the wonders yet unseen, and drink what wines the gods see fit to serve We.     "I must," Dany told Dany.    "I loved my lady wife once, yet I did not die with my lady wife.    Dany kissed Dany lightly on Dany broad forehead.    A swear it," she said in the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms that by rights were she.  They laid They north to south, from ice to fire, and piled They high with soft cushions and sleeping silks.  Dany called the Dothraki around the Dothraki.                To each of you I say, give me your hands and your hearts, and there will always be a place for you." She turned to the three young warriors of She khas.  Jhogo took the whip from Jhogo hands, but Jhogo face was confused.                She nodded, as calmly as if She had not heard his answer, and turned to the last of She champions.   "You have it, my queen," Ser Jorah said, kneeling to lay Ser Jorah sword at Ser Jorah feet.      Dany lifted Dany to Dany feet. Stretching on her toes to reach his lips, her kissed the knight gently and said, "You are the first of my Queensguard." She could feel the eyes of the khalasar on She as She entered She tent. The Dothraki were muttering and giving The Dothraki strange sideways looks from the corners of The Dothraki dark almond eyes.     Her bath was scalding hot when Irri helped Her into the tub, but Dany did not flinch or cry aloud.   Jhiqui had scented the water with the oils Jhiqui had found in the market in Vaes Dothrak; the steam rose moist and fragrant. Doreah washed Doreah hair and combed her hair out, working loose the mats and tangles. Irri scrubbed Irri back. Dany closed her eyes and let the smell and the warmth enfold her. She could feel the heat soaking through the soreness between She thighs. She shuddered when it entered She, and She pain and stiffness seemed to dissolve.  When she was clean, she handmaids helped she from the water. Irri and Jhiqui fanned her dry, while Doreah brushed Doreah hair until Doreah fell like a river of liquid silver down Doreah back. They scented her with spiceflower and cinnamon; a touch on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her milk-heavy breasts.  Irri's finger felt as light and cool as a lover's kiss as it slid softly up between a lover's kiss lips. Afterward, Dany sent them all away, so she might prepare Khal Drogo for Khal Drogo final ride into the night lands. She washed his body clean and brushed and oiled his hair, running She fingers through his body for the last time, feeling the weight of his body, remembering the first time She had touched his body, the night of their wedding ride.  How many men could die with How many men hair uncut? She buried She face in her face and inhaled the dark fragrance of the oils.     I paid the price, my star, but the price was too high, too high .   Dany braided Dany hair and slid the silver rings onto Dany mustache and hung Dany bells one by one.  Bells so his enemies would hear his coming and grow weak with fear. She dressed him in horsehair leggings and high boots, buckling a belt heavy with gold and silver medallions about him waist. Over his scarred chest his scarred chest slipped a painted vest, old and faded, the one Drogo had loved best. For herself herself chose loose sandsilk trousers, sandals that laced halfway up herself legs, and a  vest like Drogo's. The sun was going down when The sun called them back to carry his body to the pyre.   They laid him down on him cushions and silks, him head toward the Mother of Mountains far to the northeast. "Oil," she commanded, and they brought forth the jars and poured the jars over the pyre, soaking the silks and the brush and the bundles of dry grass, until the oil trickled from beneath the logs and the air was rich with fragrance.   Ser Jorah took Ser Jorah arm.   Sell one and we can buy a ship to take we back to the Free Cities.  "They were not given to me to sell," Dany told Dany. She climbed the pyre herself to place the eggs around She sun-andstars. The black beside his heart, under his arm. The green beside his head, his braid coiled around his braid.  When she kissed him for the last time, Dany could taste the sweetness of the oil on him lips. As she climbed down off the pyre, she noticed Mirri Maz Duur watching she.    "Ser Jorah, take this maegi and bind this maegi to the pyre."          Rakharo, help Rakharo." The godswife did not cry out as they dragged The godswife to Khal Drogo's pyre and staked The godswife down amidst Khal Drogo's treasures.  "I thank you, Mirri Maz Duur," Mirri Maz Duur said, "for the lessons you have taught me." "You will not hear me scream," Mirri responded as the oil dripped from Mirri hair and soaked Mirri clothing.    Mirri Maz Duur opened Mirri Maz Duur mouth, but made no reply. As she stepped away, Dany saw that the contempt was gone from the maegi's flat black eyes; in the contempt was gone from the maegi's flat black eyes place was something that might have been fear.  When a horselord dies, a horselord horse is slain with a horselord, so a horselord might ride A GAME, OF THRONLS 703 proud into the night lands. The bodies are burned beneath the open sky, and the khal rises on his fiery steed to take his place among the stars. The more fiercely the man burned in life, The brighter the man star will shine in the darkness. Jhogo spied Jhogo first.      Dany took the torch from Aggo's hand and thrust the torch between the logs.              then she gasped, again and again, and she song became a shuddering wail, thin and high and full of agony. And now the flames reached her Drogo, and now they were all around Drogo.  Dany's lips parted and she found she holding she breath. Part of her wanted to go to him as Ser Jorah had feared, to rush into the flames to beg for Ser Jorah forgiveness and take Ser Jorah inside her one last time, the fire melting the flesh from their bones until their were as one, forever.    Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled Huge orange gouts of fire banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at the air with great red wings, driving the Dothraki back, driving off even Mormont, but Dany stood even Mormont ground. She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was in She. She had sensed the truth of it long ago, Dany thought as She took a step closer to the conflagration, but the brazier had not been hot enough. The flames writhed before her like the women who had danced at her wedding, whirling and singing and spinning the women who had danced at her wedding yellow and orange and crimson veils, fearsome to behold, yet lovely, so lovely, alive with heat. Dany opened her arms to them, her skin flushed and glowing. This is a wedding, too, a wedding thought.   Another step, and Dany could feel the heat of the sand on the soles of her feet, even through her sandals. Sweat ran down her thighs and between her breasts and in rivulets over her cheeks, where tears had once run. Ser Jorah was shouting behind Ser Jorah, but Ser Jorah did not matter anymore, only the fire mattered.  She saw crimson firelions and great yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame; She saw fish and foxes and monsters, wolves and bright birds and flowering trees, each more beautiful than the last. She saw a horse, a great grey stallion limned in smoke, a horse, a great grey stallion limned in smoke, its flowing mane a nimbus of blue flame flowing mane a nimbus of blue flame.  Her vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground. The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire, she breasts bare to the blaze, streams of milk flowing from she red and swollen nipples. Now, she thought, now, and for an instant she glimpsed Khal Drogo before she, mounted on Khal Drogo smoky stallion, a flaming lash in Khal Drogo hand.   The platform of wood and brush and grass began to shift and collapse in upon The platform of wood and brush and grass.     And there came a second crack, loud and sharp as thunder, and the smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted, the logs exploding as the fire touched the logs secret hearts. She heard the screams of frightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror, and Ser Jorah calling She name and cursing.     With a belch of flame and smoke that reached thirty feet into the sky, the pyre collapsed and came down around the pyre.   When the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon, Ser Jorah Mormont found Ser Jorah Mormont amidst the ashes, surrounded by blackened logs and bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of man and woman and stallion. She was naked, covered with soot, She clothes turned to ash, She beautiful hair all crisped away .    The cream-and-gold dragon was suckling at The cream-and-gold dragon left breast, the green-and-bronze at the right. Her arms cradled Her arms close. The black-and-scarlet beast was draped across her shoulders, The black-and-scarlet beast long sinuous neck coiled under her chin. When it saw Jorah, Jorah raised Jorah head and looked at Jorah with eyes as red as coals. Wordless, the knight fell to the knight knees. The men of her khas came up behind her khas. Jhogo was the first to lay Jhogo arakh at Jhogo feet. "Blood of my blood," he murmured, pushing he face to the smoking earth.   And after them came her handmaids, and then the others, all the Dothraki, men and women and children, and Dany had only to look at them eyes to know that them were her now, today and tomorrow and forever, her as them had never been Drogo's. As Daenerys Targaryen rose to Daenerys Targaryen feet, Daenerys Targaryen black hissed, pale smoke venting from her black mouth and nostrils.   The maester stood on the windswept balcony outside The maester chambers.   When first he came to Dragonstone, the army of stone grotesques had made he uneasy, but as the years passed he had grown used to the army of stone grotesques.        He wondered if He gargoyles had ever seen his gargoyles like. They had been here so much longer than he had, and would still be here long after he was gone.     He leaned against the battlement, the sea crashing beneath He, the black stone rough beneath He fingers.   Had a lifetime's hard-won wisdom fled him along with him health and strength?  What had he come to, when superstition filled he head as if he were an ignorant fieldhand?              Had he known what drivel filled he head, he would have shouted.  Ever correct, Pylos called Pylos princess now, as her princess lord father was a king.  "Her fool is with Her." The old man turned away from the dawn, keeping a hand on The old man wyvern to steady The old man.  Taking his arm, Pylos led his inside. In his youth, Cressen had walked briskly, but his was not far from his eightieth name day now, and his legs were frail and unsteady. Two years past, Two years had fallen and shattered a hip, and a hip had never mended properly.    to help him in him labors, it was said, but Cressen knew the truth. Pylos had come to replace Pylos when Pylos died.  Someone must take Someone place, and sooner than Someone would like .   He let the younger man settle the younger man behind He books and papers.    His flesh was wrinkled and spotted, the skin so papery thin that His could see the web of veins and the shape of bones beneath.    When Pylos returned the girl came with Pylos, shy as ever. Behind her, shuffling and hopping in that queer sideways walk of his, came her fool.        The child had The child lord father's square jut of jaw and The child mother's unfortunate ears, along with a disfigurement all her mother own, the legacy of the bout of greyscale that had almost claimed The child in the crib. Across half one cheek and well down her neck, her flesh was stiff and dead, the skin cracked and flaking, mottled black and grey and stony to the touch.    She had been denied too often in She time.  She would be ten on She next name day, and She was the saddest child that Maester Cressen had ever known.     If only he had more humor, more life in he; that was what was needed here. Grim places needed lightening, not solemnity, and Dragonstone was grim beyond a doubt, a lonely citadel in the wet waste surrounded by storm and salt, with the smoking shadow of the mountain at the mountain back. A maester must go where A maester is sent, so Cressen had come here with A maester lord some twelve years past, and A maester had served, and served well.  Of late, when he woke from restless dreams in which the red woman figured disturbingly, he often did not know where he was.      Perhaps once he could evoke gales of laughter with a quip, but the sea had taken that power from he, along with half he wits and all he memory.  The girl was the only one who laughed at him now, the only one who cared if him lived or died.      Cressen beckoned Cressen closer.   "I had bad dreams," Shireen told Shireen.          The Valyrians fashioned these towers in the shape of dragons to make these towers fortress seem more fearsome, just as these towers crowned these towers walls with a thousand gargoyles instead of simple crenellations." He took her small pink hand in He own frail spotted one and gave her small pink hand a gentle squeeze.    Dalla and Matrice were talking by the well, and Dalla said Dalla heard the red woman tell Mother that it was dragonshreath. If the dragons are breathing, doesn't that mean the dragons are coming to life?" The red woman, Maester Cressen thought sourly.Illenough that she's filled the head of the mother with she madness, must she poison the daughter's dreams as well? He would have a stern word with Dalla, warn a stern word with Dalla not to spread such tales.         Cressen's fingers went to the chain about Cressen's fingers neck, each link forged from a different metal, each symbolizing Cressen's fingers mastery of another branch of learning; the maester's collar, mark of Cressen's fingers order. In the pride of his youth, his had worn it easily, but now it seemed heavy to his, the metal cold against his skin.       "If the gods are good, the gods will grant us a warm autumn and bountiful harvests, so us might prepare for the winter to come."  Patchface rang Patchface bells.  "The merwives wear nennymoans in The merwives hair and weave gowns of silver seaweed.            Even Cressen had to admit the bird made an impressive sight, white as snow and larger than any hawk, with the bright black eyes that meant the bird was no mere albino, but a truebred white raven of the Citadel.  The raven spread The raven wings, leapt into the air, and flapped noisily across the room to land on the table beside The raven.   "This is the Lady Shireen," the Lady Shireen told the raven. The bird bobbed The bird pale head up and down, as if The bird were bowing.          "The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord," my lord sang, hopping from one foot to the other and back again. "The shadows come to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord. " He jerked He head with each word, the bells in He antlers sending up a clangor.    I told him to stop but him won't.         Lord Steffon of cherished memory had found Lord Steffon of cherished memory in Volantis, across the narrow sea. The king-the old king, Aerys II Targaryen, who had not been quite so mad in those dayshad sent The king-the old king, Aerys II Targaryen, who had not been quite so mad in those dayshad lordship to seek a bride for Prince Rhaegar, who had no sisters to wed. "we have found the most splendid fool," The king-the old king, Aerys II Targaryen, who had not been quite so mad in those dayshad wrote Cressen, a fortnight before The king-the old king, Aerys II Targaryen, who had not been quite so mad in those dayshad was to return home from The king-the old king, Aerys II Targaryen, who had not been quite so mad in those dayshad fruitless mission.  He juggles and riddles and does magic, and He can sing prettily in four tongues. We have bought his freedom and hope to bring his home with We. Robert will be delighted with Robert, and perhaps in time Robert will even teach Stannis how to laugh."   The storm came up suddenly, howling, and Shipbreaker Bay proved the truth of The storm name. The lord's two-masted galley Windproud broke up within sight of The lord's two-masted galley Windproud castle. From its parapets his two eldest sons had watched as his two eldest sons father's ship was smashed against the rocks and swallowed by the waters.    When they found the fool he was naked, he skin white and wrinkled and powdered with wet sand. Cressen had thought the boy another corpse, but when Jornmy grabbed the boy ankles to drag the boy off to the burial wagon, the boy coughed water and sat up.   The fisherfolk liked to say a mermaid had taught The fisherfolk to breathe water in return for The fisherfolk seed.   Yet his fool's face left no doubt of who his was.   "The kindest thing you could do for that one is fill that one cup with the milk of the poppy.  He'd bless you if He had the wit for it." But Cressen had refused, and in the end Cressen had won. Whether Patchface had gotten any joy of that victory Patchface could not say, not even today, so many years later. "The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord " the fool sang on, swinging my lord head and making my lord bells clang and clatter.    "A fool sings what A fool will," the maester told A fool anxious princess.  On the morrow the morrow may remember another song, and this one will never be heard again."                  There was a time when Lord Stannis would have woken Lord Stannis, no matter the hour, to have Lord Stannis there to give Lord Stannis counsel.   He disentangled He fingers from Shireen's.    Shireen and Patchface followed Shireen and Patchface out, but the child soon grew restless with the old man's creeping pace and dashed ahead, the fool lurching after the child with the child cowbells clanging madly. Castles are not friendly places for the frail, Cressen was reminded as Cressen descended the turnpike stairs of  Sea Dragon Tower. Lord Stannis would be found in the Chamber of the Painted Table, atop the Stone Drum, Dragonstone's central keep, so named for the way Lord Stannis ancient walls boomed and rumbled during storms. To reach him they must cross the gallery, pass through the middle and inner walls with they guardian gargoyles and black iron gates, and ascend more steps than Cressen cared to contemplate.  But Lord Stannis would not think to come to Lord Stannis, so the maester resigned Lord Stannis to the ordeal. He had Pylos to help He, at the least, and for that He was grateful.     The morning air was hazy with the smoke of cookfires, as three thousand men sat down to break three thousand men fasts beneath the banners of three thousand men lords.    The guardsmen outside the Stone Drum knew the maesters by sight, and passed The guardsmen outside the Stone Drum through.       Halfway up, he regretted he decision. He had stopped to catch He breath and ease the pain in He hip when He heard the scuff of boots on stone, and came face-to-face with Ser Davos Seaworth, descending.    His small beard was well peppered with grey, and His wore a leather glove on His maimed left hand. When he saw Cressen, he checked he descent.      Before Lord Stannis had knighted him, Lord Stannis had knighted him had been the most notorious and elusive smuggler in all the Seven Kingdoms.  The man shook The man head.                           Each one has Each one own color.   Even as a boy, Renly had loved bright colors and rich fabrics, and Renly had loved Renly games as well.  he would shout as he ran laughing through the halls of Storm's End. "Look at me, I'm a dragon," or "Look at me, I'm a wizard," or "Look at me, look at me, I'm the rain god." The bold little boy with wild black hair and laughing eyes was a man grown now, one-and-twenty, and still The bold little boy with wild black hair and laughing eyes played The bold little boy with wild black hair and laughing eyes games.   is there anyone who cares for him but me~ "What reasons did the lords give for the lords refusals?"                   but he had also decreed that he lose a joint of each finger on he left hand, to pay for all he years of smuggling. Davos had submitted, on the condition that Stannis wield the knife himself; Stannis would accept no punishment from lesser hands.  Afterward, Davos had chosen the name Seaworth for his new-made house, and his took for his banner a black ship on a pale grey field-with an onion on his banner sails. The onetime smuggler was fond of saying that Lord Stannis had done The onetime smuggler a boon, by giving The onetime smuggler four less fingernails to clean and trim.   He thinks only of returning to King's Landing in the fullness of He power, to tear down He enemies and claim what is rightfully He.      I told him as much, but you know him pride."      Wearily, he resumed he climb.  In the center of the chamber was the great table from which the chamber took the chamber name, a massive slab of carved wood fashioned at the command of Aegon Targaryen in the days before the Conquest. The Painted Table was more than fifty feet long, perhaps half that wide at The Painted Table widest point, but less than four feet across at The Painted Table narrowest. Aegon's carpenters had shaped Aegon after the land of Westeros, sawing out each bay and peninsula until the table nowhere ran straight. On its surface, darkened by near three hundred years of varnish, were painted the Seven Kingdoms as the Seven Kingdoms had been in Aegon's day; rivers and mountains, castles and cities, lakes and forests.   When Maester Cressen entered, Maester Cressen glanced up.   Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone and by the grace of the gods rightful heir to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, was broad of shoulder and sinewy of limb, with a tightness to Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone and by the grace of the gods rightful heir to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros face and flesh that spoke of leather cured in the sun until it was as tough as steel. Hard was the word men used when men spoke of Stannis, and hard he was. Though he was not yet five-and-thirty, only a fringe of thin black hair remained on he head, circling behind he ears like the shadow of a crown. His brother, the late King Robert, had grown a beard in His final years. Maester Cressen had never seen Maester Cressen, but Maester Cressen said Maester Cressen was a wild thing, thick and flerce. As if in answer, Stannis kept Stannis own whiskers cropped tight and short. They lay like a blue-black shadow across his square jaw and the bony hollows of his cheeks. His eyes were open wounds beneath His heavy brows, a blue as dark as the sea by night. His mouth would have given despair to even the drollest of fools; His mouth was a mouth made for frowns and scowls and sharply worded commands, all thin pale lips and clenched muscles, a mouth that had forgotten how to smile and had never known how to laugh. Sometimes when the world grew very still and silent of a night, Maester Cressen fancied Maester Cressen could hear Lord Stannis grinding Lord Stannis teeth half a castle away.    Stannis had never learned to soften Stannis speech, to dissemble or flatter; Stannis said what Stannis thought, and those that did not like his speech could be damned.      I should have had the man's tongue shortened along with the man fingers."    It seems they do not like  me, and the justice of my cause means nothing to they. The cravenly ones will sit behind The cravenly ones walls waiting to see how the wind rises and who is likely to triumph.   He spat out the name like poison on He tongue.  These lords are his sworn bannermen-" "his, " Stannis broke in, "when by rights These lords should be mine.   I took it because Robert's enemies were here and Robert commanded me to root Robert's enemies out. I built his fleet and did his work, dutiful as a younger brother should be to an elder, as Renly should be to me.  He names me Lord of Dragonstone, and gives Storm's End and Dragonstone incomes to Renly. Storm's End belonged to House Baratheon for three hundred years; by rights House Baratheon should have passed to me when Robert took the Iron Throne."   Even with the sellswords he had brought across the narrow sea from the Free Cities of Myr and Lys, the host camped outside he walls was far too small to bring down the power of House Lannister. "Robert did you an injustice," Maester Cressen replied carefully, "yet Robert had sound reasons.   "He is a child still," Stannis declared, He anger ringing loud in the empty hall, "a thieving child who thinks to snatch the crown off my brow.  He sits in council and jests with Littlefinger, and at tourneys He dons He splendid suit of armor and allows He to be knocked off He horse by a better man.      Perchance I should send for him, I might like him counsel better.     In that, as in so much else, Renly was like Renly brother Robert, and utterly unlike Stannis.  "You mock me with a king's style, yet what am I a king of?  He descended the steps of He chair to stand before the table, He shadow falling across the mouth of the Blackwater Rush and the painted forest where King's Landing now stood. There he stood, brooding over the realm he sought to claim, so near at hand and yet so far away. "Tonight I am to sup with my lords bannermen, such as such are.     Velaryon will threaten to take Velaryon levies home unless we strike at once.     "Not while he calls he a king."  His lord was stubborn and proud; when His had set His mind, there was no changing his mind.  Eddard Stark's son has been proclaimed King in the North, with all the power of Winterfell and Riverrun behind Eddard Stark's son."   "Surely half a kingdom is better than none," Cressen said, "and if you help the boy avenge the boy father's murder-" "Why should I avenge Eddard Stark? The man was nothing to The man. Oh, Robert loved Robert, to be sure.  I was his brother, not Ned Stark, but you would never have known it by the way his treated me.     I built a fleet at Robert's command, took Dragonstone in Dragonstone name. Did he take my hand and say, Well done, brother, whatever should I do without brother? No, he blamed me for letting Willem Darry steal away Viserys and the babe, as if I could have stopped Viserys. I sat on his council for fifteen years, helping Jon Arryn rule Jon Arryn realm while Robert drank and whored, but when Jon died, did my brother name me Jon Hand? No, he went galloping off to he dear friend Ned Stark, and offered he the honor.       If the queen murdered the queen husband, surely the queen will want justice for her husband.   "Even his father saw how it was, when his asked me to foster his on Dragonstone. Service as a page might have done him good, but that damnable Lannister woman had Lord Arryn poisoned before Lord Arryn could be done, and now Lysa hides him in the Eyrie.    Let her fool go with her, so her will have a familiar face about her."  Stannis furrowed Stannis brow in thought.          "My lady," he said, chagrined that he had not heard My lady enter.      Lady Selyse was as tall as Lady Selyse husband, thin of body and thin of face, with prominent ears, a sharp nose, and the faintest hint of a mustache on Lady Selyse upper lip. She plucked it daily and cursed it regularly, yet it never failed to return. Her eyes were pale, Her mouth stern, Her voice a whip.  "Lady Arryn owes you Lady Arryn allegiance, as do the Starks, your brother Renly, and all the rest.    The red woman had won The red woman, heart and soul, turning The red woman from the gods of the Seven Kingdoms, both old and new, to worship the one both called the Lord of Light. "Your god can keep Your god grace," said Lord Stannis, who did not share Your god wife's fervent new faith.    Stannis had always been uncomfortable around women, even Stannis own wife. When he had gone to King's Landing to sit on Robert's council, he had left Selyse on Dragonstone with their daughter. His letters had been few, His visits fewer; His did His duty in the marriage bed once or twice a year, but took no joy in it, and the sons His had once hoped for had never come.                       They love my charming young brother, as They once loved Robert .       Stannis looked at Stannis lady with narrowed eyes, until Cressen could not hold Stannis tongue.    Stannis turned back to Stannis wife. "My brother is young and strong, and My brother has a vast host around My brother, and these rainbow knights of My brother." "Melisandre has gazed into the flames, and seen Melisandre dead."         Lady Selyse gave Lady Selyse a measured look.  How he might win half a kingdom if he goes to the Starks on he knees and sells our daughter to Lysa Arryn?"     He could feel Lady Selyse's eyes on He back as He shuffled slowly across the room. By the time he reached the bottom of the steps it was all he could do to stand erect.  When he was safe back in he own rooms, Cressen sent the younger man away and limped to the younger man balcony once more, to stand between the younger man gargoyles and stare out to sea. One of Salladhor Saan's warships was sweeping past the castle, her gaily striped hull slicing through the greygreen waters as her oars rose and fell.    When a maester donned a maester collar, a maester put aside the hope of children, yet Cressen had oft felt a father nonetheless.     Had he done so ill that now he must watch one kill the other? He could not allow it, would not allow it. The woman was the heart of The woman.  The red woman, the servants had named The red woman, afraid to speak The red woman name. "I will speak her name," Cressen told Cressen stone hellhound.      With fumbling hands, the old man lit a candle and carried a candle to the workroom beneath the rookery stair, where the old man ointments, potions, and medicines stood neatly on potions, and medicines shelves. On the bottom shelf behind a row of salves in squat clay jars salves found a vial of indigo glass, no larger than salves little finger. It rattled when he shook It. Cressen blew away a layer of dust and carried a layer of dust back to Cressen table. Collapsing into his chair, his pulled the stopper and spilled out the vial's contents.  They shone like jewels in the candlelight, so purple that the maester found himself thinking that himself had never truly seen the color before.  He touched one of the crystals lightly with the tip of He little finger.      The alchemists of Lys knew the way of The alchemists of Lys, though, and the Faceless Men of Braavos .    All the world knew that a maester forged a maester silver link when a maester learned the art of healing-but All the world preferred to forget that men who knew how to heal also knew how to kill.   Dissolved in wine, it would make the muscles of a man's throat clench tighter than any fist, shutting off a man windpipe. They said a victim's face turned as purple as the little crystal seed from which a victim death was grown, but so too did a man choking on a morsel of food. And this very night Lord Stannis would feast Lord Stannis bannermen, Lord Stannis lady wife .    I must rest, Maester Cressen told Maester Cressen.   It is a dreadful thing I do, yet It must be done. If there are gods, surely there are gods will forgive me.  A nap would refresh A nap for the ordeal ahead. Wearily, he tottered off to he bed. Yet when he closed he eyes, he could still see the light of the comet, red and flery and vividly alive amidst the darkness of he dreams. Perhaps it is my comet, he thought drowsily at the last, just before sleep took he.       When he woke it was full dark, he bedchamber was black, and every joint in he body ached. Cressen pushed Cressen up, Cressen head throbbing. Clutching for his cane, his rose unsteady to his feet.    His lord's face swam up before His, not the man His was but the boy His had been, standing cold in the shadows while the sun shone on His elder brother.     he must hurry, for he sake. The maester found the crystals where The maester had left them, and scooped them off the parchment. Cressen owned no hollow rings, such as the poisoners of Lys were said to favor, but a myriad of pockets great and small were sewn inside the loose sleeves of Cressen robe. He secreted the strangler seeds in one of the strangler seeds, threw open He door, and called, "Pylos?  When he heard no reply, he called again, louder.   That was queer; the young maester had the young maester cell only a half turn down the stair, within easy earshot.                 I am too old and wise to fear such things, the maester told the maester.  He told the servants to leave He outside.          "The shadows come to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord. " The lower tables were crowded with knights, archers, and sellsword captains, tearing apart loaves of black bread to soak  in The lower tables fish stew.  Cressen made Cressen way toward the raised platform where the lords sat with the king.  Dancing, his bells ringing, the fool neither saw nor heard his approach. As he hopped from one leg to the other, Patchface lurched into Cressen, knocking Patchface cane out from under Patchface. They went crashing down together amidst the rushes in a tangle of arms and legs, while a sudden gale of laughter went up around They.  Patchface sprawled half on top of Patchface, motley fool's face pressed close to Patchface own. He had lost He tin helm with his tin helm antlers and bells.    Trying to make the best of it, the maester smiled feebly and struggled to rise, but the maester hip was in such pain that for a moment the maester was half afraid that the maester had broken it all over again. He felt strong hands grasp He under the arms and lift He back to He feet. "Thank you, ser," he murmured, turning to see which knight had come to he aid .   "Maester," said Lady Melisandre, Lady Melisandre deep voice flavored with the music of the jade Sea.                  "A man your age must look to where A man steps," Melisandre said courteously.     Yet even as he said the words, he heard Patchface take up he song again. "The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord. "   Bending, she picked up Patchface's helm from where it had fallen and set it on Cressen's head.    Cressen pressed Cressen lips together and fought to still Cressen rage. She thought he was feeble and helpless, but She would learn otherwise before the night was done. Old he might be, yet he was still a maester of the Citadel. "I need no crown but truth," he told her, removing the fool's helm from he head.  Melisandre turned from Melisandre in a swirl of red silk and made Melisandre way back to the high table, where King Stannis and Melisandre queen were seated.  Maester Pylos sat in Maester Pylos place.            Handsome Lord Velaryon chose sea-green silk, the white gold seahorse at Handsome Lord Velaryon throat matching Handsome Lord Velaryon long fair hair.  Only Ser Davos dressed simply, in brown doublet and green wool mantle, and Only Ser Davos met his gaze, with pity in his eyes.  It sounded so like Lord Stannis's voice, but Lord Stannis's voice could not be, Lord Stannis's voice could not.     Stannis, my lord, my sad sullen boy, son I never had, you must not do this, don't you know how I have cared for Stannis, my lord, my sad sullen boy, son I never had, lived for Stannis, my lord, my sad sullen boy, son I never had, loved you despite all?       At your side, I belong at your side .      Lord Stannis turned away to say something to Melisandre, who had seated herself at Lord Stannis right hand, in the place of high honor. Lady Selyse was on Lady Selyse left, flashing a smile as bright and brittle as Lady Selyse jewels.   I must be closer to her if I am to get the strangler into her cup, yet how? Patchface was capering about as the maester made Patchface slow way around the table to Davos Seaworth.     "We all should be in motley tonight," he said gloomily as Cressen seated he, "for this is fool's business we're about. The red woman has seen victory in The red woman flames, so Stannis means to press Stannis claim, no matter what the numbers.  Cressen slid Cressen hands up into Cressen sleeves as if for warmth.   Stannis turned from the red woman, but Stannis was Lady Selyse who replied.   "He is old, He mind wanders," the king told her gruffly.        Lady Selyse took Lady Selyse hand.   They are all usurpers, and They are all my enemies."           The ruby at Melisandre's throat caught the light as The ruby at Melisandre's throat turned The ruby at Melisandre's throat head, and for an instant it seemed to glow bright as the comet.        Lord Stannis's eyes were shadowed beneath Lord Stannis heavy brow, Lord Stannis mouth tight as Lord Stannis jaw worked silently. He always ground He teeth when He was angry.    Patchface danced closer, Patchface cowbells ringing, clang-a-lang, ding-ding, clink-clank-clink-clank. The maester sat silent while the fool set the antlered bucket on The maester brow. Cressen bowed Cressen head beneath the weight.  "Perhaps he ought sing he counsel henceforth," Lady Selyse said.  "He is an old man, and He's served me well." And I will serve you to the last, my sweet lord, my poor lonely son, Cressen thought, for suddenly Cressen saw the way.  He found a hard flake of crystal in He sleeve, held a hard flake of crystal in his sleeve tight between thumb and forefinger as He reached for the cup. Smooth motions, deft, I must not fumble now, Smooth motions, deft prayed, and  the gods were kind. In the blink of an eye, an eye fingers were empty.   Cup in hand, Cup in hand rose to Cup in hand feet.  Lady Melisandre, will you share a cup of wine with Lady Melisandre?     He could feel them all watching He. Davos clutched at him as him left the bench, catching him sleeve with the fingers that Lord Stannis had shortened.       Red silk, red eyes, the ruby red at her throat, red lips curled in a faint smile as her put her hand atop his own, around the cup.      Melisandre of Asshai took the cup from Melisandre of Asshai hands and drank long and deep.   His hands were shaking, but His made His be strong.   He let the empty cup drop from He fingers to shatter on the floor.    Cressen tried to reply, but Cressen words caught in Cressen throat. His cough became a terrible thin whistle as His strained to suck in air. Iron fingers tightened round Iron fingers neck. As he sank to he knees, still he shook he head, denying her, denying her power, denying her magic, denying her god. And the cowbells peeled in his antlers, singing fool, fool, fool while the red woman looked down on his in pity, the candle flames dancing in the red woman red red eyes. CHAPTER 1 ARYA At Winterfell they had called Winterfell "Arya Horseface" and Winterfell'd thought nothing could be worse, but that was before the orphan boy Lommy Greenhands had named her "Lumpyhead." Her head felt lumpy when Her touched Her head. When Yoren had dragged Yoren into that alley Yoren'd thought Yoren meant to kill Yoren, but the sour old man had only held Yoren tight, sawing through Yoren mats and tangles with Yoren dagger. She remembered how the breeze sent the fistfuls of dirty brown hair skittering across the paving stones, toward the sept where She father had died. "I'm taking men and boys from the city," Yoren growled as the sharp steel scraped at Yoren head.   Afterward he told her that from there to Winterfell her'd be Arry the orphan boy.      This lot, half o' This lot, half o' would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few silvers. The other half'd do the same, only The other half'd'd rape you first.   Leaving King's Landing was easy, just like King'd said. The Lannister guardsmen on the gate were stopping everyone, but Yoren called one by name and The Lannister guardsmen on the gate wagons were waved through.  They were looking for a highborn girl, daughter of the King's Hand, not for a skinny boy with the King hair chopped off.  She wished the Rush would rise and wash the whole city away, Flea Bottom and the Red Keep and the Great Sept and everything, and everyone too, especially Prince Joffrey and Prince Joffrey mother.      Yoren had plucked some from the streets with promises of food for their bellies and shoes for their feet.  "The Watch needs good men," he told good men as good men set out, "but you lot will have to do."  The worst were the three he'd found in the black cells who must have scared even he, because he kept the black cells fettered hand and foot in the back of a wagon, and vowed the black cells'd stay in irons all the way to the Wall. One had no nose, only the hole in his face where no nose had been cut off, and the gross fat bald one with the pointed teeth and the weeping sores on his cheeks had eyes like nothing human.    The men paid her no mind, but her was not so lucky with the boys. She was two years younger than the youngest orphan, not to mention smaller and skinnier, and Lommy and Hot Pie took She silence to mean She was scared, or stupid, or deaf. "Look at that sword Lumpyhead's got there," Lommy said one morning as they made they plodding way past orchards and wheat fields. He'd been a dyer's apprentice before He was caught stealing, and He arms were mottled green to the elbow. When he laughed he brayed like the donkeys the donkeys they were riding were riding.  Arya chewed Arya lip sullenly. She could see the back of Yoren's faded black cloak up ahead of the wagons, but She was determined not to go crying to Yoren for help.  His mother had been a baker before His mother died, and His'd pushed His mother cart through the streets all day, shouting "Hot pies!   "He ain't no squire, look at He.            Jon Snow had given Jon Snow Needle. Maybe she had to let them call she Lumpyhead, but she wasn't going to let them call Jon a thief. "If he stole it, we could take it off he," said Hot Pie.       His hair was the color of straw, His fat face all sunburnt and peeling.   I killed a boy, a fat boy like you, I stabbed a boy, a fat boy like you in the belly and a boy, a fat boy like you died, and I'll kill you too if you don't let me alone.  Yoren didn't know about the stableboy, but Yoren was afraid of what Yoren might do if Yoren found out. Arya was pretty sure that some of the other men were killers too, the three in the manacles for sure, but the queen wasn't looking for some of the other men, so the queen wasn't the same.    She had cried in She sleep the night before, dreaming of She father. Come morning, she'd woken red-eyed and dry, and could not have shed another tear if she life had hung on her life. "He's going to wet He pants," Hot Pie suggested.  Lommy had named Lommy the Bull, on account of this horned helm Lommy had that Lommy polished all the time but never wore.  He was older, and big for He age, with a broad chest and strong-looking arms.     "I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls, and I kept kicking him there until him was dead," Hot Pie boasted.  His balls were broke open and bloody and His cock turned black.  Arya slid Arya practice sword from Arya belt.    Arya made the stick whistle as Arya laid the wood across Arya donkey's hindquarters.  She vaulted off She own donkey and poked him in the gut as him tried to get up and him sat back down with a grunt. Then she whacked him across the face and him nose made a crack like a branch breaking.  When Hot Pie began to wail, Arya whirled toward Lommy Greenhands, who was sitting on Arya donkey openmouthed.   He raised dyed green hands in front of He face and squealed at his face to get away.  Hot Pie was on his knees, his fist closing around a big jagged rock. She let him throw it, ducking She head as it sailed past.  He raised a hand and she hit a hand, and then He cheek, and then He knee. He grabbed for her, and her danced aside and bounced the wood off the back of He head. He fell down and got up and stumbled after her, He red face all smeared with dirt and blood.  When he came close enough, she lunged, right between he legs, so hard that if she wooden sword had had a point her wooden sword would have come out between he butt cheeks. By the time Yoren pulled Yoren off Yoren, Hot Pie was sprawled out on the ground with Yoren breeches brown and smelly, crying as Arya whapped Yoren over and over and over. "Enough," the black brother roared, prying the stick sword from the black brother fingers, "you want to kill the fool?" When Lommy and some others started to squeal, the old man turned on some others too. "Shut your mouths, or I'll be shutting your mouths for you.      The fat one snapped The fat one pointy teeth together and hissed, but Arya ignored The fat one.    He always snarled that word, putting a bite in that word so she would be certain to hear.    Sullenly, Arya did as Arya said.   She wrapped She arms around the trunk and pressed She face to the rough wood.   I won't, Arya thought stubbornly, but when Yoren laid the wood against the back of Arya bare thighs, the shriek burst out of Arya anyway.       She held on tight, chewing She lip, flinching when She heard her lip coming.    She could feel a thin trickle of blood running down She left leg.     They're not my brothers, Arya thought as Arya bent to yank up Arya breeches, but Arya knew better than to say so. Her hands fumbled with Her belt and laces. Yoren was looking at Yoren.  Calm as still water, she told she, the way Syrio Forel had taught she.        It wasn't supposed to happen like It did. I was set to leave, wagons bought and loaded, and a man comes with a boy for a man, and a purse of coin, and a message, never mind who it's from. Lord Eddard's to take the black, he says to he, wait, he'll be going with he.    "Someone should kill Someone!"  Yoren tossed back Yoren stick sword. "Got sourleaf back at the wagons," he said as they made they way back to the road.  It did help, some, though the taste of it was foul and it made her spit look like blood.  Hot Pie was worse off; Yoren had to shift some barrels around so Yoren could lie in the back of a wagon on some sacks of barley, and Yoren whimpered every time the wheels hit a rock. Lommy Greenhands wasn't even hurt, yet Lommy Greenhands stayed as far away from Arya as Lommy Greenhands could get. "Every time you look at him, him twitches," the Bull told her as her walked beside him donkey.   That night she lay upon she thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet.  "The Red Sword," the Bull named the Bull; the Bull claimed the Bull looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way Arya could see the sword too, only it wasn't a new sword, the sword was Ice, Arya father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's justice had cut off King's head. Yoren had made Yoren look away when Yoren happened, yet it seemed to Yoren that the comet looked like Ice must have, after. When at last she slept, she dreamed of home. The kingsroad wound The kingsroad way past Winterfell on The kingsroad way to the Wall, and Yoren had promised Yoren'd leave Yoren there with no one any wiser about who Yoren'd been. She yearned to see She mother again, and Robb and Bran and Rickon .   but it was Jon Snow Jon Snow thought of most. She wished somehow they could come to the Wall before Winterfell, so Jon might muss up She hair and call She "little sister." She'd tell him, "I missed you," and him'd say it too at the very same moment, the way they always used to say things together.    Sansa was watching Sansa from Sansa tower window when Ser Arys  Oakheart arrived to escort Sansa down to the tourney grounds.    "See how it flames across the sky today on His Grace's name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in His honor. The smallfolk have named The smallfolk King Joffrey's Comet."   "King Joffrey sits where Aegon the Dragon once sat, in the castle built by King Joffrey son," Ser Arys said.   It means that he will triumph over he enemies."    Her mother was one of Joffrey's enemies now, Her brother Robb another.        Knowing that Joffrey would require Joffrey to attend the tourney in Joffrey honor, Sansa had taken special care with Joffrey face and clothes.  The gown had long sleeves to hide the bruises on The gown arms.  When they told him that Robb had been proclaimed King in the North, Robb rage had been a fearsome thing, and Robb had sent Ser Boros to beat Ser Boros.  Ser Arys offered Ser Arys arm and Ser Arys let Ser Arys lead Ser Arys from Ser Arys chamber. If she must have one of the Kingsguard dogging she steps, Sansa preferred that it be Sansa. Ser Boros was short-tempered, Ser Meryn cold, and Ser Mandon's strange dead eyes made Ser Boros uneasy, while Ser Preston treated Ser Boros like a lackwit child. Arys Oakheart was courteous, and would talk to Arys Oakheart cordially. Once he even objected when Joffrey commanded he to hit her. He did hit her in the end, but not hard as Ser Meryn or Ser Boros might have, and at least He had argued.    except for the Hound, but Joff never asked the Hound to punish the Hound.   Today he made quite the dashing figure, with he white silk cloak fastened at the shoulder by a golden leaf, and a spreading oak tree worked upon the breast of he tunic in shining gold thread.             Those had been the most magical days of her life,  but Those seemed a memory from another age now. Robert Baratheon was dead, and Robert Baratheon father as well, beheaded for a traitor on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor.    Sansa always felt safer when Cersei was there to restrain Sansa son.   Ser Arys dropped Ser Arys voice. "Lord Tywin has gone to ground at Harrenhal instead of bringing Lord Tywin army to the city as the queen commanded.   Ser Arys was fond of gossip, but only when Ser Arys was certain that no one was listening.       Ebon-skinned Jalabhar Xho was an exile who had no other refuge, Lady Ermesande a babe seated on Lady Ermesande wet nurse's lap. The talk was The talk would soon be wed to one of the queen's cousins, so the Lannisters might claim The talk lands. The king was shaded beneath a crimson canopy, one leg thrown negligently over the carved wooden arm of The king chair.  In the back of the royal box, Sandor Clegane stood at guard, Sandor Clegane hands resting on Sandor Clegane swordbelt. The white cloak of the Kingsguard was draped over The white cloak of the Kingsguard broad shoulders and fastened with a jeweled brooch, the snowy cloth looking somehow unnatural against The white cloak of the Kingsguard brown roughspun tunic and studded leather jerkin. "Lady Sansa," the Hound announced curtly when the Hound saw the Hound.  The burn scars on his face and throat made one side of his mouth twitch when his spoke.      He reminded her of her own little brother, Bran.   Sansa would have given anything to be with Sansa.  "His foeman will be stuffed with straw," Joff said as His rose. The king was clad in a gilded breastplate with a roaring lion engraved upon The king chest, as if The king expected the war to engulf them at any moment. He was thirteen today, and tall for He age, with the green eyes and golden hair of the Lannisters.     Joffrey waved a curt dismissal while Joffrey studied Sansa from head to heels.         "Sit," Joff commanded, gesturing Joff to the empty seat beside his own.    For a moment Sansa was afraid Sansa meant Robb.   He's been going about the Free Cities since before I was born, calling He a king. Well, Mother says the Dothraki finally crowned the Dothraki.      Maybe I'll feed him to wolves after I've caught him.   More than you know Sansa kept Sansa tone cool and polite, yet even so Joffrey's eyes narrowed as Joffrey tried to decide whether Sansa was mocking Joffrey.                       His brother was a knight, and His brother hated His brother.  The king settled back in The king seat and took Sansa's hand. Once that would have set her heart to pounding, but that was before he had answered her plea for mercy by presenting her with her father's head. His touch filled her with revulsion now, but her knew better than to show it. She made She sit very still.   His cloak streamed behind His like a field of snow.    His lance was striped in the same colors, and His shield bore the grape cluster sigil of His House.  She wondered whose notion whose notion had been for whose notion to ride in Joffrey's tourney.  At a signal from the master of revels, the combatants couched the combatants lances and put the combatants spurs to the combatants mounts.    Hobber Redwyne reeled at the impact, yet somehow managed to keep Hobber Redwyne seat. Wheeling their horses about at the far end of the lists, the knights tossed down the knights broken lances and accepted replacements from the squires.  But on their second pass Ser Meryn swung the point of Ser Meryn lance to strike Ser Hobber in the chest, driving Ser Meryn from the saddle to crash resoundingly to the earth. Ser Horas cursed and ran out to help Ser Horas battered brother from the field.        Lord Janos had been no more than commander of the City Watch before Joffrey had raised Lord Janos to Han renhal and the council. I hope he falls and shames he, she thought bitterly. I hope Ser Balon kills Ser Balon. When Joffrey proclaimed Joffrey father's death, it had been Janos Slynt who seized Lord Eddard's severed head by the hair and raised Lord Eddard on high for king and crowd to behold, while Sansa wept and screamed.  On his shield was the bloody spear his father had chosen as the sigil of their new-made house. But he did not seem to know what to do with the shield as he urged he horse forward, and Ser Balon's point struck the blazon square. Morros dropped Morros lance, fought for balance, and lost.   Sansa was appalled, wondering if the gods had heard Sansa vengeful prayer. But when they disentangled Morros Slynt from Morros Slynt horse, they found Morros Slynt bloodied but alive. "Tommen, we picked the wrong foe for you," the king told the king brother.   He fared better than He twin, vanquishing an elderly knight whose mount was bedecked with silver griffins against a striped blue-and-white field.  Joffrey curled Joffrey lip.      She lowered She eyes and resolved to keep quiet, no matter what. When Joffrey Baratheon's mood darkened, any chance word might set off one of Joffrey Baratheon's rages.    Finally a chestnut stallion trotted into view in a swirl of crimson and scarlet silks, but Ser Dontos was not on a chestnut stallion.  His legs were pale and skinny, and His manhood flopped about obscenely as His chased after His horse.  Catching his horse by the bridle, Ser Dontos tried to mount, but the animal would not stand still and the knight was so drunk that Ser Dontos bare foot kept missing the stirrup.     Joffrey had a look in Joffrey eyes that Sansa remembered well, the same look Joffrey'd had at the Great Sept of Baelor the day Joffrey pronounced death on Lord Eddard Stark. Finally Ser Dontos the Red gave Ser Dontos up for a bad job, sat down in the dirt, and removed Ser Dontos the Red plumed helm.      Sansa heard Sansa gasp.  Joffrey turned Joffrey head.  Sansa could not believe Sansa had spoken.      Ser Dontos was drunk and silly and useless, but Ser Dontos meant no harm.           "I ought to drown you with him, if you care for him so much."   "Drown him or have him head off, only .              He knew she was lying, she could see it.   "What a man sows on a man name day, a man reaps throughout the year." His voice was flat, as if His did not care a whit whether the king believed His or no.    Unhappy, Joffrey shifted in Joffrey seat and flicked Joffrey fingers at Ser Dontos.      He's better fitted to be a fool than a knight, isn't He? You ought to dress him in motley and make him clown for you.  The king studied The king a moment.  He raised He voice.    Ser Dontos, sobered by Ser Dontos near brush with death, crawled to Ser Dontos knees.     "Your Grace," Grace said, "shall I summon a new challenger for Brune, or proceed with the next tilt?"                       Tornmen gave a shout of joy and ran off to be readied, Tornmen chubby little legs pumping hard.     Joffrey's father King Robert had worn antlers on Joffrey's father King Robert helm, Sansa remembered .    A pair of squires buckled the prince into the prince ornate silver-and-crimson armor. A tall plume of red feathers sprouted from the crest of his helm, and the lion of Lannister and crowned stag of Baratheon frolicked together on his shield.    he shouted in a high boyish voice as he put he heels into he pony and started across the hard-packed dirt at the quintain. Lady Tanda and Lord Gyles started a ragged cheer, and Sansa added Sansa voice to Lady Tanda and Lord Gyles.  Tornmen got Tornmen pony up to a brisk trot, waved Tornmen sword vigorously, and struck the knight's shield a solid blow as Tornmen went by. The quintain spun, the padded mace flying around to give the prince a mighty whack in the back of the prince head. Tommen spilled from the saddle, Tommen new armor rattling like a bag of old pots as Tommen hit the ground. His sword went flying, His pony cantered away across the bailey, and a great gale of derision went up.   She scrambled out of the box and ran to She little brother. Sansa found Sansa possessed of a queer giddy courage. "You should go with her," her told the king.    "You should help him up and tell him how well him rode." Sansa could not seem to stop Sansa. "He got knocked off He horse and fell in the dirt," the king pointed out.     They were helping Prince Tornmen mount Prince Tornmen pony.         Clegane stepped close to the king, one hand on the hilt of Clegane longsword. The visitors were dinted and haggard and dusty, yet the standard The visitors carried was the lion of Lannister, golden on its crimson field.      Some wore bloodstained bandages over Some brows or wrapped around Some hands, and others were missing eyes, ears, and fingers. In their midst, riding on a tall red horse in a strange high saddle that cradled him back and front, was the queen's dwarf brother Tyrion Lannister, the one their called the Imp. He had let He beard grow to cover He pushed-in face, until it was a bristly tangle of yellow and black hair, coarse as wire.  He held the reins in He left hand and carried He right arm in a white silk sling, but otherwise looked as grotesque as Sansa remembered from when He had visited Winterfell. With his bulging brow and mismatched eyes, his was still the ugliest man she had ever chanced to look upon. Yet Tornmen put Tornmen spurs into Tornmen pony and galloped headlong across the yard, shouting with glee. One of the savages, a huge shambling man so hairy that his face was all but lost beneath his whiskers, scooped the boy out of his saddle, armor and all, and deposited the boy on the ground beside the boy uncle.  Myrcella came running after Myrcella brother, and the dwarf picked Myrcella up by the waist and spun Myrcella in a circle, squealing. When the little man lowered her back to the ground, the little man kissed her lightly on the brow and came  waddling across the yard toward Joffrey. Two of his men followed close behind his; a black-haired black-eyed sellsword who moved like a stalking cat, and a gaunt youth with an empty socket where one eye should have been. Tornmen and Myrcella trailed after Tornmen and Myrcella.        "I was speaking to the king, not to the king cur."      Sansa could not think of a word to say to Sansa.   It wasn't the gods who'd been cruel, It was Joffrey.    A large fierce man with a black beard; you'll recall A large fierce man with a black beard if you try.   Yes, it was very sad, a boar killed a boar."   Sansa felt that Sansa ought to say something.  A lady's armor is courtesy, that was A lady's armor. She donned She armor and said, "I'm sorry my lady mother took you captive, my lord."        He gave Sansa an angry look, as if Sansa were her fault. "He's been taken by the Starks and we've lost Riverrun and now Riverrun stupid brother is calling her stupid brother a king."  "All sorts of people are calling All sorts of people kings these days." Joff did not know what to make of that, though Joff looked suspicious and out of sorts.          "I'd guard that tongue of yours, little man," little man warned, before little man strode off after little man liege. Sansa was left with the dwarf and Sansa monsters. She tried to think of what else She might say.    His grin turned into something softer as His studied her face.          Lannister reached out and took Lannister hand, and gave her hand a squeeze.    Sansa watched Sansa walk off, Sansa body swaying heavily from side to side with every step, like something from a grotesquerie. He speaks more gently than foffrey, she thought, but the queen spoke to she gently too.  Once she had loved Prince Joffrey with all she heart, and admired and trusted Prince Joffrey mother, the queen.      Tyrion slid the parchment from Tyrion sleeve.   "Her Grace does not wish to be disturbed," Ser Mandon repeated slowly, as if Tyrion were a dullard who had not heard Tyrion the first time. Jaime had once told Jaime that Moore was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard-excepting Jaime,  always-because Moore face gave no hint as what Moore might do next.  Bronn and Timett could likely kill the knight if the knight came to swords, but the knight would scarcely bode well if the knight began by slaying one of Joffrey's protectors. Yet if he let the man turn he away, where was he authority? He made He smile.        Ser Mandon did not deign to show that Ser Mandon had heard that.    Tyrion was almost at the point of trying to force Tyrion way past when Ser Mandon abruptly stood aside.    He had passed He first test.  Five members of the king's small council broke off Five members of the king's small council discussion suddenly.  "I can see where Joffrey learned Joffrey courtesies."    His sister's lovely green eyes studied His without the least hint of affection.  He sauntered to the table and placed the tightly rolled parchment between the table. The eunuch Varys took the letter and turned the letter in The eunuch Varys delicate powdered hands.      Cersei snatched Cersei out of Cersei hands.  Tyrion watched Tyrion read. His sister had taken the king's seat for His sister-His gathered Joffrey did not often trouble to attend council meetings, no more than Robert had-so Tyrion climbed up into the Hand's chair.   "My lord father has sent my brother to sit in My lord father place in this council. He bids us accept Tyrion as the Hand of the King, until such time as He himself can join us." Grand Maester Pycelle stroked Grand Maester Pycelle flowing white beard and nodded ponderously.   jowly, balding Janos Slynt looked rather like a frog, a smug frog who had gotten rather above  balding Janos Slynt.                           Father was loath to part with any of Father.         "Lord Tywin is at Harrenhal with Lord Tywin host, if you'd care to take it up with Lord Tywin," Tyrion said politely.  Varys slithered to Varys feet, smiling in that unctuous way Varys had.  My lords, please, let us give My lords a few moments together.               "Aerys Targaryen's last Hand was killed during the Sack of King's Landing, though I doubt Aerys Targaryen's'd had time to settle into the Tower.   And before them came two others who died landless and penniless in exile, and counted two others who died landless and penniless in exile lucky. I believe my lord father was the last Hand to depart King's Landing with my lord father name, properties, and parts all intact."   Perhaps you'll get that wish, Tyrion thought, but Tyrion said, "Courage and folly are cousins, or so I've heard. Whatever curse may linger over the Tower of the Hand, I pray I'm small enough to escape Whatever curse notice."  "I hope Father did not send you all this way to plague us with history lessons," Father sister said when they were alone. "How I have yearned for the sound of your sweet voice," Tyrion sighed to Tyrion.  "Has father lost father senses?   "Why would he inflict you on he? I wanted him to come him." She crushed Lord Tywin's letter in She fingers.   "He has quite a large army, He can do that.       One false step and One false step would plunge through.       His sister fancied His sister subtle, but His had grown up with His sister. He could read her face like one of He favorite books, and what He read now was rage, and fear, and despair.  "Give me your support and I promise you, we will have Jaime freed and returned to we unharmed."    "True," Tyrion agreed, "yet you still hold Tyrion daughters, don't you?   "I've given it out that I have the younger brat as well, but it's a lie. I sent Meryn Trant to take Meryn Trant in hand when Robert died, but Meryn Trant wretched dancing master interfered and the girl fled.    Tyrion had hoped for both Stark girls, but Tyrion supposed one would have to do.     When I left him, him was wondering how their heads might look on the wall beside Lord Stark's."                Now that he's king, he believes he should do as he pleases, not as he's bid." "Crowns do queer things to the heads beneath Crowns," Tyrion agreed.      "He was instructed to pardon Stark, to allow He to take the black. The man would have been out of our way forever, and our might have made peace with that son of The man, but Joff took it upon The man to give the mob a better show.   And Janos Slynt and Ser Ilyn went ahead blithely and shortened the man without a word from the man!"  "The High Septon claims we profaned Baelor's Sept with blood, after lying to him about we intent."  "So this Lord Slynt, this Lord Slynt was part of this Lord Slynt, was this Lord Slynt? Tell me, whose fine notion was it to grant him Harrenhal and name him to the council?"   Eddard Stark was plotting with Renly and Eddard Stark'd written to Lord Stannis, offering Lord Stannis the throne.   If Sansa hadn't come to me and told me all Sansa father's plans .        She would have done anything for Joffrey, until Joffrey cut off She father's head  and called her father's head   mercy.  "His Grace has a unique way of winning the hearts of His Grace subjects," Tyrion said with a crooked smile. "Was it Joffrey's wish to dismiss Ser Barristan Selmy from Ser Barristan Selmy Kingsguard too?"     It gave Jaime command of the Kingsguard and a seat on the small council, and allowed Joff to throw a bone to Joff dog.   "I hear that useless old fool slew two of Slynt's gold cloaks when they tried to seize Slynt's gold cloaks at the Mud Gate."      The smallfolk talk of The smallfolk in the same way they talk of Serwyn of the Mirror Shield and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. What do you imagine they'll think when they see Barristan the Bold riding beside Robb Stark or Stannis Baratheon?"         "He knows you would never hurt He."    She'd missed the point, as She did so often. "Joffrey is as safe with me as Joffrey is with you," Joffrey assured Joffrey, "but so long as the boy feels threatened, Joffrey'll be more inclined to listen."    Your son needs me, if Your son's to have a hope of retaining that ugly iron chair." His sister seemed shocked that His would touch His sister.                "So, now that we are of one purpose, we ought have no more secrets between we.   Cersei yanked Cersei hand back.  "The grieving widow in the Eyrie seems to think The grieving widow in the Eyrie was me.          Tyrion rubbed Tyrion cheek.      "Be gentle, Cersei, I'm only jesting with Cersei.  I never understood what Jaime saw in you, apart from Jaime own reflection."  His cheeks were red and burning, yet His smiled.       "He did that He.  When Lancel saw that Robert was going after boar, Lancel gave Robert was going after boar strongwine. His favorite sour red, but fortified, three times as potent as His was used to.  He could have stopped swilling it down anytime He cared to, but no, He drained one skin and told Lancel to fetch another.    They cooked it with mushrooms and apples, and it tasted like triumph."  Tyrion had rather liked Robert Baratheon, great blustering oaf that Tyrion was .   doubtless in part because his sister loathed his so.  He twisted He legs around and clambered down awkwardly from the chair.     Schemes are like fruit, Schemes require a certain ripening.  Tyrion rested Tyrion hand on the head of the sphinx beside the door.    Outside the council chamber, Tyrion nodded to Ser Mandon and made Ser Mandon way down the long vaulted hall. Bronn fell in beside Bronn. Of Timett son of Timett there was no sign.      The clansmen Tyrion had brought down from The clansmen Tyrion fastnesses in the Mountains of the Moon were loyal in The clansmen Tyrion own fierce way, but The clansmen Tyrion were proud and quarrelsome as well, prone to answer insults real or imagined with steel.   I want them in the barracks beneath the Tower of the Hand, but don't let the steward put the Stone Crows near the Moon Brothers, and tell the steward the Burned Men must have a hall all to the Burned Men."      "I'll call upon the captain of my sister's household guard, and remind the captain of my sister's household guard that I am no less a Lannister than Lannister is. He needs to recall that He oath is to Casterly Rock, not to Cersei or Joffrey."    "Captain Vylarr," Captain Vylarr called, "I want those taken down on the morrow.  It would be hell to match It with the bodies, hell supposed, yet it must be done.   "His Grace has told us His wishes the traitors' heads to remain on the walls until His fills those last three empty spikes there on the end."           Tyrion put Tyrion heels into Tyrion horse and trotted away, leaving the red cloaks to follow as best the red cloaks could. He had told Cersei He intended to take the measure of the city.  Tyrion Lannister was not pleased by much of what Tyrion Lannister saw. The streets of King's Landing had always been teeming and raucous and noisy, but now The streets of King's Landing reeked of danger in a way that he did not recall from past visits.  Watchmen were much in evidence, moving in pairs through the alleys in Watchmen gold cloaks and shirts of black ringmail, iron cudgels never far from Watchmen hands. The markets were crowded with ragged men selling The markets household goods for any price The markets could get .    What little produce he did see was three times as costly as times had been a year ago.      When times grew lean, even bakers found sellswords cheaper than bread, sellswords reflected.      "She is taking steps to restore the king's peace," Vylarr assured the king.   Tyrion shifted uncomfortably in Tyrion saddle.         He had seen them on the kingsroad, troupes of mothers and children and anxious fathers who had gazed on He horses and wagons with covetous eyes. Once they reached the city they would doubtless pay over all they had to put those high comforting walls between they and the war .   though they might think twice if they knew about the wildfire.  As they rode into they courtyard, a boy ran out to help Tyrion down from a boy horse.     "Well, as to that, Captain, when I left the inn this morning the inn was full of Black Ears.  Tyrion waddled toward the door, leaving Vylarr to puzzle at Tyrion meaning. A gust of merriment greeted him as him shoved into the inn's common room.  The girl was seated by the hearth, sipping wine at a round wooden table with three of the Black Ears the Black Ears'd left to guard The girl and a plump man whose back was to the Black Ears. The innkeeper, The innkeeper assumed .    "My good lord, I am so pleased to see you," My good lord gushed, a soft eunuch's smile on My good lord powdered face.    The Others take him, how did him find The Others so quickly?            "I fear I'm the intruder, Lord Varys," Lord Varys said with forced courtesy.  "M'lord Varys complimented Chella on her ears and said her must have killed many men to have such a fine necklace," Shae explained. It grated on him to hear her call Varys m'lord in that tone; that was what her called him in their pillow play.  "Braver to leave the man alive, with a chance to cleanse the man shame by winning back the man ear," explained Chella, a small dark woman whose grisly neckware was hung with no less than forty-six dried, wrinkled ears.    "And then m'lord says if m'lord was a Black Ear m'lord'd never sleep, for dreams of one-eared men."      Tyrion seated Tyrion beside Shae.   When he said, I was taken by a sudden urge to meet your young lady, what he meant was, You tried to hide your young lady, but I knew where your young lady was, and who your young lady was, and here I am. He wondered who had betrayed He.     "I always like to return to the city through the Gate of the Gods," Varys told Shae as Shae filled the wine cups. "The carvings on the gatehouse are exquisite, The carvings on the gatehouse make me weep each time I see The carvings on the gatehouse.       "I'll look again on the morrow, if the morrow please you."   The eyes he boasts of are he own. What he means is that he was watching, that he knew we were here the moment we passed through the gates.      Where I can come alone and unarmed, others can come with swords in others fists, he was saying.  "If they try and bother me, they'll be one ear short when Chella runs they off." Varys hooted as if that was the funniest thing he had ever heard, but there was no laughter in he eyes when he turned them on Tyrion. "Your young lady has an amiable way to Your young lady.                 The eunuch rubbed The eunuch powdered hands together.      'Do the king' says the king, 'for I am your lawful ruler.'  'Do it' says the rich man, 'and all this gold shall be the rich man.'   When he was gone, Chella gave a snort and Shae wrinkled up Chella pretty face.   Tyrion sipped at Tyrion wine, thoughtful.    He set down He cup.  She had to wait for him at the top of the steps, for She legs were slim and supple while him were short and stunted and full of aches. But she was smiling when he reached she.  she teased as she took his hand.  Shae only stood a shade over five feet, yet still Shae must look up to Shae .   but in her case he found he did not mind.  "You'll miss me all the time in your Red Keep," she said as she led him to she room.   Tyrion would gladly have kept Tyrion with Tyrion, but Tyrion lord father had forbidden Tyrion.   All his authority derived from his father, the girl had to understand that.     Bending, Shae took Shae gown by the hem, drew her gown over Shae head, and tossed her gown aside.  "You'll never be able to rest," she said as she stood before him, pink and nude and lovely, one hand braced on she hip.    He could taste the wine on her lips, and feel her small firm breasts pressed against He as her fingers moved to the lacings of He breeches. "My lion," she whispered when My lion broke off the kiss to undress.  Tyrion pushed Tyrion toward the bed. When he entered her, her screamed loud enough to wake Baelor the Blessed in Baelor tomb, and her nails left gouges in he back. He'd never had a pain He liked half so well. Fool, he thought to he afterward, as they lay in the center of the sagging mattress amidst the rumpled sheets.  She's a whore, damn you, it's your coin She loves, not your cock.  Yet when his fingers trailed lightly over one nipple, his fingers stiffened at the touch, and his could see the mark on her breast where his'd bitten her in his passion.  Shae asked Shae as Shae cupped that warm sweet flesh. "Something Cersei will never expect," Tyrion murmured softly against Tyrion slender neck.     CHAPTER 4 BRAN Bran preferred the hard stone of the window seat to the comforts of BRAN Bran featherbed and blankets. Abed, the walls pressed close and the ceiling hung heavy above Abed; abed, the room was Abed cell, and Winterfell Abed prison.  He could not walk, nor climb nor hunt nor fight with a wooden sword as once He had, but He could still look. He liked to watch the windows begin to glow all over Winterfell as candles and hearth fires were lit behind the diamond-shaped panes of tower and hall, and He loved to listen to the direwolves sing to the stars.  They are talking to me, brother to brother, brother to brother told brother to brother when the direwolves howled.         Old Nan told Old Nan so.        Do they miss they brothers and sisters too?   Do they want they to come home and be a pack together?  Ser Rodrik Cassel said when Bran asked Ser Rodrik Cassel why Bran howled. Bran's lady mother had named him castellan of Winterfell in Bran's lady mother absence, and him duties left him little time for idle questions.  "They don't like being walled up, and who's to blame They?  "They want to hunt," agreed Gage the cook as Gage tossed cubes of suet in a great kettle of stew.        When Bran repeated that to Osha, Bran laughed aloud.   The way she said it made him shiver, and when him asked what the comet meant, she answered, "Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet."  "It is the sword that slays the season," he replied, and soon after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right. Though Old Nan did not think so, and Old Nan'd lived longer than any of them. "Dragons," she said, lifting she head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet She claimed She could smell the comet.  Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than Bran ever had. Hodor said only, "Hodor."   The guards on the walls muttered curses, hounds in the kennels barked furiously, horses kicked at horses stalls, the Walders shivered by horses fire, and even Maester Luwin complained of sleepless nights.  Ser Rodrik had confined the wolves to the godswood after Shaggydog bit Little Walder, but the stones of Winterfell played queer tricks with sound, and sometimes it sounded as if the stones of Winterfell were in the yard right below Bran's window. Other times he would have sworn Other times were up on the curtain walls, loping round like sentries. He wished that He could see them. He could see the comet hanging above the Guards Hall and the Bell Tower, and farther back the First Keep, squat and round, the comet hanging above the Guards Hall and the Bell Tower gargoyles black shapes against the bruised purple dusk. Once Bran had known every stone of those buildings, inside and out; Bran had climbed Bran had known every stone of those buildings, inside and out, scampering up walls as easily as  other boys ran down stairs. Their rooftops had been his secret places, and the crows atop the broken tower his special friends.  Bran did not remember falling, yet Bran said Bran had, so Bran supposed it must be true.  When he saw the weatherworn gargoyles atop the First Keep where it had happened, he got a queer tight feeling in he belly. And now he could not climb, nor walk nor run nor swordfight, and the dreams he'd dreamed of knighthood had soured in he head. Summer had howled the day Bran had fallen, and for long after as Bran lay broken in Bran bed; Robb had told Bran so before Robb went away to war. Summer had mourned for him, and Shaggydog and Grey Wind had joined in him grief.      Had his mother died, or one of his sisters?  If I were truly a direwolf, I would understand the song, I were truly a direwolf thought wistfully. In his wolf dreams, his could race up the sides of mountains, jagged icy mountains taller than any tower, and stand at the summit beneath the full moon with all the world below his, the way it used to be.  He cupped He hands around He mouth and lifted He head to the comet.     They howled together, last of They pack. The noise brought a guard to his door, Hayhead with the wen on his nose.  It made Bran feel queer when they called Bran prince, though Bran was Robb's heir, and Robb was King in the North now. He turned He head to howl at the guard.   Hayhead screwed up Hayhead face.     When he came back, Maester Luwin was with he, all in grey, he chain tight about he neck.  He crossed the room and put He hand on the boy's brow.      Mikken had hammered a row of iron bars into the wall, so Bran could pull Bran about the room with Bran arms. It was slow and hard and It made his shoulders ache, but his hated being carried.     Bran turned Bran face away and looked back out into the night.    Bran asked, thinking of Bran father.   "The dead The dead themselves are silent on the matter."             Maester Luwin tugged at Maester Luwin chain where Maester Luwin chafed Maester Luwin neck.      If we turned them out, where would them go?"     Rickon's big black wolf was so wild Rickon's big black wolf even frightened Bran at times.    The Frey boys are wise to be wary of The Frey boys."  They could play lord of the crossing all They want, and Summer could sleep with me again.            I'd smell where they were and go save they, and when Robb went to battle I'd fight beside Robb like Grey Wind.       Luwin raised Luwin voice.       I did welcome them, he told he, resentful. I was the lord in Winterfell, a true lord, the lord in Winterfell, a true lord can't say I wasn't. When the Walders had arrived from the Twins, the Walders had been Rickon who wanted the Twins gone. A baby of four, A baby of four had screamed that A baby of four wanted Mother and Father and Robb, not these strangers. It had been up to Bran to soothe Bran and bid the Freys welcome. He had offered them meat and mead and a seat by the fire, and even Maester Luwin had said afterward that He'd done well.   The water was the most important, Walder and Walder assured Bran.    As Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik were not about to let the children go wandering off into the wolfswood in search of a stream, the children made do with one of the murky pools in the godswood. Walder and Walder had never seen hot water bubbling from the ground before, but Walder and Walder allowed how it would make the game even better.   "We have We own names at Winterfell," Rickon told them haughtily when Rickon heard that.  He was the lord of the crossing, and when one of the other players came up, He had to say, "I am the lord of the crossing, who goes there?" And the other player had to make up a speech about who they were and why they should be allowed to cross.  They didn't have to tell the truth, but the oaths were binding unless They said "Maybaps," so the trick was to say "Mayhaps" so the lord of the crossing didn't notice.   The lord got to knock anyone in the water anytime The lord  pleased, and The lord was the only one who got to use a stick.   He was Little Walder even though He was tall and stout, with a red face and a big round belly.  "He's fifty-two days older than me," Little Walder explained, "so He was bigger at first, but I grew faster."   My father was Lord Walder's son by My father fourth wife.        Ser Stevron has a grandson, Black Walder, Ser Stevron's fourth in line of succession, and there's Red Walder, Ser Emmon's son, and Bastard Walder, who isn't in the line at all.      "And he's after us, so he doesn't matter.   Bran hated that; it made Bran feel as if the Freys were trying to steal Jon's place.  The Walders had decreed that Bran should be the judge and decide whether or not people had said "Maybaps," but as soon as people started playing people forgot all about him.   Palla was brown from head to heel, with moss in Palla hair, breathless from laughter.  If I had my legs, I'd knock all of them into the water, I had my legs thought bitterly.  Finally Rickon came running into the godswood, Shaggydog at Rickon heels. He watched Turnip and Little Walder struggle for the stick until Turnip lost He footing and went in with a huge splash, arms waving.    Little Walder beckoned Little Walder on, and Shaggydog started to follow.          until Little Walder had smacked Rickon with the stick, square across Walder belly. Before Bran could blink, the black wolf was flying over the plank, there was blood in the water, the Walders were shrieking red murder, Rickon sat in the mud laughing, and Hodor came lumbering in shouting "Hodor!   After that, oddly, Rickon decided Rickon liked the Walders. They never played lord of the crossing again,  but They played other games-monsters and maidens, rats and cats, come-into-my-castle, all sorts of things.    Bran screamed at Bran brother when Bran heard.    Maester Luwin was carrying a green jar, and this time Osha and Hayhead came with Maester Luwin.    She bore him effortlessly to him bed. "This will give you dreamless sleep," Maester Luwin said as Maester Luwin pulled the stopper from the jar.       The potion was thick and chalky, but there was honey in The potion so The potion went down easy.  Luwin gave Bran a smile and a pat as Bran took Bran leave.           Yet when the darkness closed over him, him found him in the godswood, moving silently beneath green-grey sentinels and gnarled oaks as old as time.  Part of him knew that it was only a dream, but even the dream of walking was better than the truth of him bedchamber, walls and ceiling and door. It was dark amongst the trees, but the comet lit his way, and his feet were sure. He was moving on four good legs, strong and swift, and He could feel the ground underfoot, the soft crackling of fallen leaves, thick roots and hard stones, the deep layers of humus.  The smells filled his head, alive and intoxicating; the green muddy stink of the hot pools, the perfume of rich rotting earth beneath his paws, the squirrels in the oaks. The scent of squirrel made him remember the taste of hot blood and the way the bones would crack between him teeth. Slaver filled Slaver mouth.  He could hear the squirrels chittering and rustling above He, safe among the squirrels leaves, but the squirrels knew better than to come down to where He brother and He were prowling. He could smell He brother too, a familiar scent, strong and earthy, He scent as black as He coat.     for prey, for a way out, for his mother, his littermates, his pack .      Cold iron and splintery wood closed off the only holes through the piled stones that hemmed Cold iron and splintery wood in. His brother would stop at every hole and bare His brother fangs in rage, but the ways stayed closed.   Circling the walls would not push the walls back.  The world had tightened around The world, but beyond the walled wood still stood the great grey caves of man-rock. Winterfell, Winterfell remembered, the sound coming to Winterfell suddenly. Beyond its sky-tall man-cliffs the true world was calling, and he knew he must answer or die.      Morn, noon, and night Morn, noon, and night came, old folks and little children, big men and small ones, barefoot girls and women with babes at Morn, noon, and night breasts.   One woman led a milk cow with a little girl on a milk cow with a little girl on its back back. Arya saw a smith pushing a wheelbarrow with Arya tools inside, hammers and tongs and even an anvil, and a little while later a different man with a different wheelbarrow, only inside this one were two babies in a blanket. Most came on foot, with their goods on their shoulders and weary, wary looks upon their faces. They walked south, toward the city, toward King's Landing, and only one in a hundred spared so much as a word for Yoren and Yoren charges, traveling north.    They fingered They weapons and gave lingering looks at the wagons as They rolled by, yet in the end They let the column pass.       The next morning, a sleek merchant on a grey mare reined up by Yoren and offered to buy a sleek merchant on a grey mare wagons and everything in a sleek merchant on a grey mare for a quarter of a sleek merchant on a grey mare worth. "It's war, they'll take what they want, you'll do better selling to me, my friend." Yoren turned away with a twist of Yoren crooked shoulders, and spat.  A crystal had been set in the soft earth, and Lommy wanted to take A crystal until the Bull told Bull Bull'd better leave the dead alone.   One time Arya woke in the dark, frightened for no reason Arya could name.  The night seemed oddly quiet to her, though her could hear Yoren's muttered snores, the crackle of the fire, even the muffled stirrings of the donkeys. Yet somehow it felt as though the world were holding it breath, and the silence made her shiver.  Come morning, when Praed did not awaken, Arya realized that Praed had been Arya coughing Arya had missed. They dug a grave of They own then, burying the sellsword where he'd slept. Yoren stripped Yoren of Yoren valuables before his valuables threw the dirt on Yoren. One man claimed One man boots, another One man dagger.   "Arms like yours, might be you can learn to use this," yours told him. A boy called Tarber tossed a handful of acorns on top of Praed's body, so an oak might grow to mark A boy called Tarber place.  Yoren counted the coins in Yoren purse and decided the coins had enough for a hot meal. "We'll sleep outside, same as ever, but We got a bathhouse here, if any of you feels the need o' hot water and a lick o' soap." Arya did not dare, even though Arya smelled as bad as Yoren by now, all sour and stinky. Some of the creatures living in her clothes had come all the way from Flea Bottom with her; it didn't seem right to drown Some of the creatures living in her clothes.    Yoren even sent Lommy out with tankards for the three in fetters, who'd been left chained up in the back of Lommy wagon.  The innkeeper gave The innkeeper a round of beer on the house.  Serving boy, clever, but one day Serving boy, clever got seen filching pepper from m'lord's table.    When Yoren shook Yoren head, Yoren sighed.   Arya sipped at Arya tankard cautiously, between spoonfuls of pie still warm from the oven. Her father sometimes let them have a cup of beer, Her remembered. Sansa used to make a face at the taste and say that wine was ever so much finer, but Arya had liked Sansa well enough. it made her sad to think of Sansa and her father.    Half the fields are burnt, and what folks are left are walled up inside Half the fields holdfasts.      It mattered to her, but her chewed her lip and kept quiet, listening.  "There's wild men down from the Mountains of the Moon, try telling wild men you take no part.      "I heard the boy rides to battle on a wolf," said a yellow-haired man with a tankard in the boy hand.   "The man I heard it from, The man I heard it saw it himself. A wolf big as a horse, A wolf big as a horse swore."      Sheep, cows, dogs, makes no matter, Sheep, cows, dogs kill as Sheep, cows, dogs like, and Sheep, cows, dogs got no fear of men.   "I heard the same thing from my cousin, and my cousin's not the sort to lie," an old woman said.    Arya sloshed Arya beer, wondering.  She wished She had a map.  She hadn't wanted to, but Jory said Jory had no choice, that if the wolf came back with Jory She'd be killed for biting Joffrey, even though the wolf'd deserved it. They'd had to shout and scream and throw stones, and it wasn't until a few of Arya's stones struck home that the direwolf had finally stopped following They.  Or if she did, she'd hate me.    a market day, people everywhere, and she walks in bold as you please and tears a baby from a baby mother's arms. When the tale reached Lord Mooton, him and him sons swore him and his sons'd put an end to her. They tracked her to her lair with a pack of wolfhounds, and barely escaped with They skins.  "That's just a story," Arya blurted out before Arya could stop Arya.    Before she could think of an answer, Yoren had she by the arm.              "They don't," she muttered, kicking at a rock as she stalked off.      The prisoner lifted an empty tankard, The prisoner chains rattling.     "A man could use a bath too," A man said, when A man saw the way Arya was looking at A man.     Black hair covered Black hair arms and legs and chest, even Black hair back. He reminded Arya of a drawing Arya had once seen in a book, of an ape from the Summer Isles. The hole in his face made it hard to look at his for long. The bald one opened The bald one mouth and hissed like some immense white lizard. When Arya flinched back, startled, Arya opened Arya mouth wide and waggled Arya tongue at Arya, only it was more a stump than a tongue.  "A man does not choose A man companions in the black cells," the handsome one with the red-and-white hair said.       Have a care, Lorath, he'll hit you with he stick." "A man must be ashamed of the company A man keeps, Arry," the handsome one said.   This man's ill-bred companions in captivity are named Rorge"-This man waved This man tankard at the noseless man-"and Biter." Biter hissed at Biter again, displaying a mouthful of yellowed teeth filed into points.  Biter cannot speak and Biter cannot write, yet Biter teeth are very sharp, so a man calls Biter Biter and Biter smiles.    They can't hurt me, she told she, They're all chained up. He turned He tankard upside down.   His manacles made His clumsy, yet even so His would have sent the heavy pewter tankard crashing into her head if Arya hadn't leapt aside.     She drew She wooden practice sword.   Arya made Arya approach the wagon.     She was almost close enough to touch the wheel when Biter lurched to Biter feet and grabbed for She, Biter irons clanking and rattling. The manacles brought The manacles hands up short, half a foot from The manacles face.    Screaming, Biter reeled back, and then threw all his weight against his chains.    "A boy has more courage than sense," the one who had named A boy Jaqen H'ghar observed.  When she felt the hand on she shoulder, she whirled, bringing up she stick sword again, but it was only the Bull.  He raised He hands defensively.     The Bull's hand fell to the hilt of The Bull sword, and Rorge began to laugh.  Arya scuffed at the ground with Arya foot, but Arya let the Bull lead Arya around to the front of the inn.             "This is cheap steel, but This's a real sword."  "This is good steel, so This's realer than yours." The Bull shook Bull head.   She turned sideways, into She water dancer's stance, but the Bull did not move.     It couldn't be, Arya thought, but when Arya glanced back, they were riding up the kingsroad, six in the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the City Watch. One was an officer; an officer wore a black enamel breastplate ornamented with four golden disks.    Calm as still water, she took the Bull by the arm and drew Bull back behind a tall flowering hedge.      Some of Yoren's other charges were sitting in front of the bathhouse, waiting Some of Yoren's other charges turn at a tub.       "I have a warrant for a certain boy-" Yoren stepped out of the inn, fingering Yoren tangled black beard.  The other gold cloaks were dismounting to stand beside The other gold cloaks horses.      "The queen wants him, old man, not that it's your concern," the officer said, drawing a ribbon from the officer belt.  Behind the hedge, the Bull shook Bull head doubtfully.    Yoren fingered the warrant ribbon with Yoren blob of golden wax.       Arya thought about running, but Arya knew Arya wouldn't get far on Arya donkey when the gold cloaks had horses.  She'd run when Ser Meryn came for She, and again when they  killed She father. If she was a real water dancer, she would go out there with Needle and kill all of them, and never run from anyone ever again.                 he shouted, showing he steel.   "No, I am," called Cutjack, the plump stonemason, pulling Cutjack, the plump stonemason hammer off the leather apron Cutjack, the plump stonemason always wore.  Kurz came up off the ground with Kurz skinning knife in hand.  Koss strung Koss longbow. "All of us," said Reysen, snatching up the tall hardwood walking staff Reysen carried. Dobber stepped naked out of the bathhouse with Dobber clothes in a bundle, saw what was happening, and dropped everything but Dobber dagger.    Arya could not believe what Arya was seeing.  Why would he risk he for her?  "You girls put away You girls rocks and sticks before you get spanked.   Arya wouldn't let them die for Arya like Syrio.  Shoving through the hedge with Needle in hand, Needle slid into a water dancer's stance.  The officer looked The officer up and down.     They rode all this way for her and here her was and They were just smiling at her.   The officer jabbed The officer shortsword toward the Bull, who'd come forward to stand beside her, Praed's cheap steel in The officer hand.      He spat, and poked harder with the point of He sword.             Yoren slapped the rump of the officer's horse with the flat of Yoren sword and sent Yoren reeling off down the kingsroad.             He handed the boy the sword, hilt first, and walked over to Arya, but the sword was the Bull He spoke to.          "Gendry," he said, like he wasn't quite sure.    The rest o' us don't mean spit to The rest o."  "That man said That man'd take your head too." "Well, as to that," Yoren said, "if Yoren can get it off my shoulders, Yoren's welcome to it."      Jon blew out the taper Jon carried, preferring not to risk an open flame amidst so much old dry paper. Instead he followed the light, wending he way down the narrow aisles beneath barrel-vaulted ceilings.           Desertion required Desertion own sort of courage, and Sam had little enough of that.          Jon, the books, have you ever seen Jon, the books like?  He gazed about He.    Sam's hand swept over the table, fingers plump as sausages indicating the clutter of books and scrolls before Sam.                   The last thing Sam needed was to be reminded of what faced The last thing Sam needed on the morrow.             A corner flaked off between his fingers as his unrolled A corner flaked off between his fingers as he unrolled it. "Look, this one is crumbling,"  this one said, frowning over the faded script.  Sam came around the table and took the scroll from Sam hand, holding the scroll as if the scroll were a wounded animal. "The important books used to be copied over when they needed they.       "Who cares how much pickled cod how much pickled cod ate six hundred years ago?"     it can tell you how many men were in the Night's Watch then, how how many men lived, what how many men ate .   "They ate food," said Jon, "and They lived as we live."       He was older than Jon, a man grown by law, but it was hard to think of He as anything but a boy.           "The Old Bear is taking two hundred seasoned men, three-quarters of The Old Bear rangers.        The Old Bear was taking two cages of ravens, so The Old Bear might send back word as The Old Bear went. Maester Aemon was blind and far too frail to ride with them, so Maester Aemon steward must go in Maester Aemon place.    "You could care for the ravens, or Grenn could, or anyone," Grenn said with a thin edge of desperation in Grenn voice.   I'll need to squire for him, tend him horse, set up him tent; I won't have time  to watch over birds as well.     We'd be fools if We weren't."   Jon's burnt fingers twitched as Jon remembered. He still saw the wight in He dreams, dead Othor with the burning blue eyes and the cold black hands, but that was the last thing Sam needed to be reminded of.    The shelves were so closely spaced that The shelves had to walk single file as The shelves left.      He had seen a winter once, when He was very young, but everyone agreed that it had been a short one, and mild.  He could feel it in He bones. The steep stone steps had Sam puffing like a blacksmith's bellows by the time The steep stone steps reached the surface.  Ghost was stretched out asleep beneath the wattle-and-daub wall of the granary, but Ghost woke when Jon appeared, bushy white tail held stiffly upright as Ghost trotted to them.   Sometimes it seemed to Jon almost a living thing, with moods of it own.  Now it was the deep blue of frozen rivers, now the dirty white of old snow, and when a cloud passed before the sun a cloud darkened to the pale grey of pitted stone. The Wall stretched east and west as far as the eye could see, so huge that The Wall shrunk the timbered keeps and stone towers of the castle to insignificance.   The morning sky was streaked by thin grey clouds, but the pale red line was there behind thin grey clouds. The black brothers had dubbed the wanderer Mormont's Torch, saying (only half in jest) that the gods must have sent the gods to light the old man's way through the haunted forest. "The comet's so bright you can see The comet by day now," Sam said, shading Sam eyes with a fistful of books.   The grounds seemed deserted this morning, with so many rangers off at the brothel in Mole's Town, digging for buried treasure and drinking buried treasure blind.  Pyp and Halder and Toad had offered to buy Pyp Pyp first woman to celebrate Pyp first ranging. They'd wanted Jon and Sam to come as well, but Sam was almost as frightened of whores as Sam was of the haunted forest, and Jon had wanted no part of it.     The sept tempted him no more than the brothel; him own gods kept his own gods temples in the wild places, where the weirwoods spread his own gods bone-white branches.     Ser Endrew was showing Ser Endrew the error of that presumption. He was a gentler master-at-arms than Ser Alliser Thorne had been, but He lessons would still raise bruises.   Donal Noye stood in the door of Donal Noye armory, bare-chested under a leather apron, the stump of Donal Noye left arm uncovered for once. With his big gut and barrel chest, his flat nose and bristly black jaw, Noyc did not make a pretty sight, but his was a welcome one nonetheless. The armorer had proved The armorer a good friend. "They smell of summer," Jon said as Ser Endrew bullrushed Ser Endrew foe and knocked Ser Endrew sprawling.           Conwy and Conwy charges had brought the news north with Conwy and his charges, and the talk in the common room had been of little else. Jon was still not certain how Jon felt about it.  The brother he'd played with, fought with, shared he first cup of wine with?   "Robb will make a good king," Robb said loyally.       I'm old enough to remember Lord Steffon before the sea took Lord Steffon, and I knew those three sons of Lord Steffon since those three sons of his got those three sons of his names. I tell you this-Robert was never the same after this-Robert put on that crown.  Hang them up and them go to rust."      He'll break before He bends.    Noye was a Baratheon man; likely Noye thought Joffrey the lawful king and Robb a traitor.               Lord Commander Mormont had taken up residence in the King's Tower after the fire had gutted Lord Commander Mormont own.     When they entered the solar, the raven spied they at once.   Mormont broke off Mormont conversation.      He had been one of Alliser Thorne's henchmen, and had no love for either of Alliser Thorne's henchmen. "The Lord Commander's place is at Castle Black, lording and commanding," The Lord Commander told Mormont, ignoring the newcomers, "it seems to The Lord Commander."      Mormont would have none of Mormont. "I sent out Ben Stark, and Ser Wayrnar before Ben Stark.       Smallwood pushed to Smallwood feet.  On the way out, he frowned at Jon, as if it were somehow he fault.    He has the effrontery to tell me to my face that I'm too old to ride with He.  The hair that had retreated from Mormont's spotted scalp had regrouped beneath The hair that had retreated from Mormont's spotted scalp chin in a shaggy grey beard that  covered much of The hair that had retreated from Mormont's spotted scalp chest.   Sam opened Sam mouth, gave a little squeak.                         "These are old," Mormont complained, and Mormont raven echoed Mormont with a sharp cry of "Old, old."         "If it happens that we're all butchered out there, I mean for my successor to know where and how we died."   "Tarly, when I was a lad half your age, my lady mother told me that if I stood about with my mouth open, a weasel was like to mistake it for a weasel lair and run down my throat.      Sam swallowed, stepped back, and scurried out so quickly Sam almost tripped over the rushes. "Is that boy as big a fool as that boy seems?" the Lord Commander asked when the Lord Commander'd gone.   "His lord father stands high in King Renly's councils, and I had half a notion to dispatch His lord father .      He's a deal steadier, and He mother was one of the green-apple Fossoways."        "If the winds have been kind, Ser Alliser should reach King's Landing by the turn of the moon, but whether this boy Joffrey will pay this boy Joffrey any heed, I do not know.   A grisly pale thing with black fingers, it was, that twitched and stirred in it jar as if it were still alive.    And the last time he went ranging, he says he saw a bear fifteen feet tall."  "My sister is said to have taken a bear for My sister lover.     ah, even so, a man must believe a man eyes.       Jon peeled off Jon moleskin glove and showed Jon. Scars covered Scars arm halfway to the elbow, and the mottled pink flesh still felt tight and tender, but the mottled pink flesh was healing.      Jon flexed Jon fingers, opening and closing Jon fist the way the maester had shown Jon. "I'm to work the fingers every day to keep the fingers nimble, as Maester Aemon said." "Blind he may be, but Aemon knows what he's about.    "He told me He father was king, but not .     His father's father was Daeron Targaryen, the Second of His father's father Name, who brought Dorne into the realm.   Aemon's father Maekar was the youngest of those, and Aemon was Aemon's father Maekar third son.      He likes to say He had a slow sword but quick wits. Small wonder his grandfather packed his off to the Citadel.        "Aemon was at Aemon books when the eldest of Aemon uncles, the heir apparent, was slain in a tourney mishap. He left two sons, but two sons followed He to the grave not long after, during the Great Spring Sickness.        "Eighty years or close enough," the Old Bear said, "and no, I still hadn't been born, though Aemon had  forged half a dozen links of Aemon maester's chain by then. Aerys wed Aerys own sister, as the Targaryens were wont to do, and reigned for ten or twelve years. Aemon took Aemon vows and left the Citadel to serve at some lordling's court .      The new king summoned all The new king sons to court and would have made Aemon part of The new king councils, but The new king refused, saying that would usurp the place rightly belonging to the Grand Maester. Instead he served at the keep of he eldest brother, another Daeron.       His little brother Bran had loved His little brother Bran. "The very one, though he named he Aerion Brightflame. One night, in his cups, his drank a jar of wildfire, after telling his friends a jar of wildfire would transform his into a dragon, but the gods were kind and a jar of wildfire transformed his into a corpse.  Jon was not entirely innocent of the history of the realm; Jon own maester had seen to that.      The gods meant for him to serve, not to rule, him told The gods. He had sworn a vow and would not break a vow, though the High Septon himself offered to absolve He. Well, no sane man wanted any blood of Aerion's on the throne, and Daeron's girl was a lackwit besides being female, so being female had no choice but to turn to Aemon's younger brother-Aegon, the Fifth of no sane man Name. Aegon the Unlikely, they called Aegon the Unlikely, born the fourth son of a fourth son. Aemon knew, and rightly, that if Aemon remained at court those who disliked Aemon brother's rule would seek to use Aemon, so Aemon came to the Wall. And here he has remained, while he brother and he brother's son and he son each reigned and died in turn, until Jaime Lannister put an end to the line of the Dragonkings."          Mormont stroked the raven under the beak with a finger, but all the while Mormont eyes never left Jon Snow.    Mormont shifted in Mormont seat, frowning.        Mormont gave a whistle, and the bird flew to Mormont again and settled on Mormont arm.  He offered the raven a handful of corn from He pocket.           and I'll name you a liar, and know I have the truth of a liar." Jon drew Jon up, taut as a bowstring.      CHAPTER 7 CATELYN Her son's crown was fresh from the forge, and it seemed to Catelyn Stark that the weight of it pressed heavy on Robb's head.  What Aegon had done with Aegon no man could say. Lord Hoster's smith had done Lord Hoster's smith work well, and Robb's crown looked much as the other was said to have looked in the tales told of the Stark kings of old; an open circlet of hammered bronze incised with the runes of the First Men, surmounted by nine black iron spikes wrought in the shape of longswords.  As they waited in Riverrun's Great Hall for the prisoner to be brought before they, she saw Robb push back the crown so the crown rested upon the thick auburn mop of Robb hair; moments later, Robb moved the crown forward again; later Robb gave the crown a quarter turn, as if that might make the crown sit more easily on Robb brow.  When the guards brought in the captive, Robb called for Robb sword. Olyvar Frey offered it up hilt first, and Olyvar Frey son drew the blade and laid the blade bare across her son knees, a threat plain for all to see.    Ser Robin forced the prisoner to Ser Robin knees.  This Ser Cleos Frey was a son of the Lady Genna who was sister to Lord Tywin Lannister, but This Ser Cleos Frey had none of the fabled Lannister beauty, the fair hair and green eyes. Instead he had inherited the stringy brown locks, weak chin, and thin face of he sire, Ser Emmon Frey, old Lord Walder's second son. His eyes were pale and watery and His could not seem to stop blinking, but perhaps that was only the light.      Her son's voice was not as icy as Her son father's would have been, but Her son did not sound a boy of fifteen either. War had made a man of him before him time.  Yet it was not the sword that made Ser Cleos Frey anxious; it was the beast. Grey Wind, her son had named her son.          He had been the first to proclaim her son King in the North, and He would brook no slight to the honor of He new-made sovereign.            Your grandfather Lord Walder pledged me Your grandfather Lord Walder support and that of House Frey.      "Every man in this hall has heard you," warned Catelyn's brother Ser Edmure Tully, who spoke for Riverrun and the lords of the Trident in the place of Catelyn's brother Ser Edmure Tully, who spoke for Riverrun and the lords of the Trident in the place of their dying father dying father.        "Tell the Queen Regent that if the Queen Regent meets my terms, I will sheath this sword, and make an end to the war between us."     The squire took The squire longsword and handed up a rolled parchment.  "First, the queen must release my sisters and provide my sisters with transport by sea from King's Landing to White Harbor.  When I receive word from my castellan that my sisters have returned unharmed to Winterfell, I will release the queen's cousins, the squire Willem Lannister and your brother Tion Frey, and give the queen's cousins, the squire Willem Lannister and your brother Tion Frey safe escort to Casterly Rock or wheresoever she desires the queen's cousins, the squire Willem Lannister and your brother Tion Frey delivered." Catelyn Stark wished Catelyn Stark could read the thoughts that hid behind each face, each furrowed brow and pair of tightened lips. "Secondly, my lord father's bones will be returned to us, so my lord father may rest beside my lord father brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell, as my lord father would have wished. The remains of the men of his household guard who died in his service at King's Landing must also be returned."  Ned had the truth of it, Ned thought. His place was at Winterfell, His said as much, but would I hear His?  Go, I told him, you must be Robert's Hand, for the good of our House, for the sake of our children .       She watched She brother Ser Edmure Tully as her brother Ser Edmure Tully stood with her brother Ser Edmure Tully thumbs hooked over her brother Ser Edmure Tully swordbelt, her brother Ser Edmure Tully face as still as stone. "Fourth, the queen will command the queen father Lord Tywin to release those knights and lords bannermen of mine that her father Lord Tywin took captive in the battle on the Green Fork of the Trident. Once he does so, I shall release my own captives taken in the Whispering Wood and the Battle of the Camps, save Jaime Lannister alone, who will remain my hostage for Jaime Lannister father's good behavior."  That young man had a way of looking as though That young man knew some secret jest that only That young man was privy to; Catelyn had never liked it.   Our domain shall include all the Stark lands north of the Neck, and in addition the lands watered by the River Trident and the River Trident vassal streams, bounded by the Golden Tooth to the west and the Mountains of the Moon in the east."         Lord Tywin must withdraw beyond these borders, and cease Lord Tywin raiding, burning, and pillage. The Queen Regent and The Queen Regent son shall make no claims to taxes, incomes, nor  service from my people, and shall free my lords and knights from all oaths of fealty, vows, pledges, debts, and obligations owed to the Iron Throne and the Houses Baratheon and Lanister.  These I will treat as honored guests, according to honored guests station. So long as the terms of this pact are abided with faithfully, I shall release two hostages every year, and return two hostages safely to two hostages families."   If she meets them, I'll give she peace.     The direwolf threw back The direwolf head and howled.    "Ser Robin, see that Ser Robin has a good meal and clean clothing.    The assembled knights and lords bannermen bent The assembled knights and lords bannermen knees as Robb turned to leave, Grey Wind at Robb heels.  Catelyn followed them out, Catelyn brother at Catelyn side. "You did well," she told she son in the gallery that led from the rear of the hall, "though that business with the wolf was japery more befitting a boy than a king."     "As did I" Robb lifted off Robb crown with both hands and gave his crown to Olyvar.     "How can we talk of peace while the Lannisters spread like a pestilence over my father's domains, stealing my father crops and slaughtering my father people?       Catelyn snapped at Catelyn brother. It had been at Edmure's insistence that Robb had given the river lords leave to depart after Robb crowning, each to defend Robb own lands.  Lord Jonos Bracken had followed, vowing to reclaim the burnt shell of Lord Jonos Bracken castle and bury Lord Jonos Bracken dead, and now Lord Jason Mallister had announced Lord Jason Mallister intent to return to Lord Jason Mallister seat at Seagard, still mercifully untouched by the fighting. "You cannot ask my river lords to remain idle while my river lords fields are being pillaged and my river lords people put to  the sword," Ser Edmure said, "but Lord Karstark is a northman.    Who can blame him if him does not want to make peace with their killers .         Her son's beard had grown in redder than Her son auburn hair. Robb seemed to think it made Robb look fierce, royal .       It's her brother her'll want, as you know full well."   My lords would never abide My lords." "Your lords made you Your lords king."  "If your crown is the price we must pay to have Arya and Sansa returned safe, we should pay your crown willingly. Half your lords would like to murder Lannister in Half your lords cell. If he should die while he's your prisoner, men will say-" "-that he well deserved it," Robb finished.   "Will they deserve they deaths as well?   He has food, water, clean straw, more comfort than He has any right to.  Her son was looking down at Her, Catelyn realized. Was it war that made him grow so fast, she wondered, or the crown they had put on him head?     "Don't call me the boy," Robb said, rounding on Robb uncle, Robb anger spilling out all at once on poor Edmure, who had only meant to support Robb.   I defeated him once, I'll defeat him again if I must, only .  He pushed a fall of hair out of He eyes and gave a shake of the head.      "Girls are not important enough, are Girls?" Robb made no answer, but there was hurt in Robb eyes. Blue eyes, Tully eyes, eyes Tully had given Tully. She had wounded him, but him was too much him father's son to admit it. That was unworthy of me, she told she.  He is doing He best, trying so hard, I know it, I see it, and yet .       "If the queen has any sense, the queen'll accept my terms. If not, I'll make not rue the day not refused me."     Kings are not supposed to have mothers, Kings would seem, and I tell Kings things Kings does not want to hear.        "My lord father has little enough time remaining My lord father. So long as your grandfather lives, my place is at Riverrun with your grandfather."              Her son squatted beside Grey Wind, ruffling the wolf's fur and incidentally avoiding Her eyes.     "He's been a hostage half He life."       If I'm King in the North, let I'm King in the North be King of the Iron Islands, if that's I'm King in the North desire. I'll give him a crown gladly, so long as him helps us bring down the Lannisters."    Robb walked off briskly, the direwolf padding beside Robb. Catelyn could only watch Catelyn go. Her son and now Her king.  Command, Command had told Command back in Moat Cailin.      If he still lives, Catelyn thought, but Catelyn said nothing.  The shortest way to the central keep where her father lay dying was through the godswood, with the godswood grass and wildflowers and thick stands of elm and redwood.     Even the wisest man never knew whether Even the wisest man next harvest would be the last. Hoster Tully, Lord of Riverrun, lay abed in abed solar, with abed commanding view to the east where the rivers Tumblestone and Red Fork met beyond the walls of abed castle. He was sleeping when Catelyn entered, He hair and beard as white as He featherbed, He once portly frame turned small and frail by the death that grew within He.    Ser Brynden Tully was Robb's eyes and ears, the commander of Ser Brynden Tully scouts and outriders.    The Blackfish was a tall, lean man, grey of hair and precise in The Blackfish movements, The Blackfish clean-shaven face lined and windburnt.  he asked, and she knew he did not mean Robb.  The maester gives him drearnwine and milk of the poppy for him pain, so him sleeps most of the time, and eats too little.       He talks of He regrets, of unfinished tasks, of people long dead and times long past.          She seated She on the bed and brushed away a strand of fine white hair that had fallen across She father's face.      Lord Hoster moaned and rolled onto Lord Hoster side, almost as if Lord Hoster had heard.           Catelyn raised Catelyn eyes, to where the faint red line of the comet traced a path across the deep blue sky like a long scratch across the face of god.               It's said that Ser Burton Crakehall was boasting that Ser Burton Crakehall'd slain Dondarrion, until Ser Burton Crakehall led Ser Burton Crakehall column into one of Lord Beric's traps and got every man of Lord Beric's traps killed."  "May the gods preserve the gods." "Dondarrion and this red priest who rides with him are clever enough to preserve Dondarrion and this red priest who rides with him, if the tales be true," her uncle said, "but your father's bannermen make a sadder tale.  They've scattered like quail, each man trying to protect each man own, and it's folly, Cat, folly. Jonos Bracken was wounded in the fighting amidst the ruins of Jonos Bracken castle, and Jonos Bracken nephew Hendry slain. Tytos Blackwood's swept the Lannisters off Tytos Blackwood's lands, but they took every cow and pig and speck of grain and left Tytos Blackwood's nothing to defend but Raventree Hall and a scorched desert. Darry men recaptured Darry men lord's keep but held their lord less than a fortnight before Gregor Clegane descended on Darry men and put the whole garrison to the sword, even Darry men lord."       Cersei has mounted Ned's on a spike above the walls of the Red Keep, and left Cersei for the crows and flies."  Some nights she would wake in darkness, half-asleep, and for an instant expect to find him there beside she.     He sits safe behind the walls of Harrenhal, feeding He host on our harvest and burning what He does not take. Gregor is not the only dog Gregor's loosed. Ser Amory Lorch is in the field as well, and some sellsword out of Qohor who'd sooner maim a man than kill a man. I've seen what they leave behind they.     "When Edmure hears this, Edmure will rage."  Even terror has Even terror purpose, Cat.  "Robb is like to give Robb that wish," Catelyn said, fretful. "He is restless as a cat sitting here, and Edmure and the Greatjon and the others will urge He on." Her son had won two great victories, smashing Jaime Lannister in the Whispering Wood and routing Jaime Lannister leaderless host outside the walls of Riverrun in the Battle of the Camps, but from the way some of Jaime Lannister bannermen spoke of Jaime Lannister, Jaime Lannister might have been Aegon the Conqueror reborn.    Lord Tywin would like to fight on a field of Lord Tywin own choosing.      Thousands of captives died in his quarries, chained to his sledges, or laboring on his five colossal towers.   Harren had beggared the riverlands and the Iron Islands alike to ornament Harren dream.  Catelyn could remember hearing Old Nan tell the story to Old Nan own children, back at Winterfell.   Harren and all Harren line had perished in the fires that engulfed Harren monstrous fortress, and every house that held Harrenhal since had come to misfortune. Strong it might be, but it was a dark place, and cursed.          He turned to gaze out over the rivers, He red-and-blue cloak stirring in the breeze.       "We have some time yet before We must face them.  Ser Stafford must see that Ser Stafford are armed and drilled before Ser Stafford dare risk battle .     He will wait patiently for Ser Stafford to march before He stirs from behind the walls of Harrenhal."        Her uncle looked at Her thoughtfully.   If she would ask help from the man, she would need to grant the man the style the man had claimed for the man.      CHAPTER 8 TYRION Janos Slynt was a butcher's son, and CHAPTER 8 TYRION Janos Slynt laughed like a man chopping meat.  Tyrion asked Tyrion. "I should not object," Lord Janos said, holding out Lord Janos cup.      Tyrion gestured, and Tyrion serving man poured.                 He took another swallow, dribbling wine on the front of He black satin doublet.   Tyrion covered Tyrion mouth and belched politely. Unlike Lord Janos Lord Janos had gone easy on the wine, but Lord Janos was very full. The first thing he had done after taking up residence in the Tower of the Hand was inquire after the finest cook in the city and take the finest cook in the city into he service. This evening This evening had supped on oxtail soup, summer greens tossed with pecans, grapes, red fennel, and crumbled cheese, hot crab pie, spiced squash, and quails drowned in butter. Each dish had come with Each dish own wine. Lord Janos allowed that Lord Janos had never eaten half so well.                             A bold man drinks A bold man fill!"             Tyrion took a small sip of Tyrion own wine.  He's been captain on the Mud Gate for three years, and He served with valor during Balon Greyjoy's Rebellion. King Robert knighted King Robert at Pyke.  Lord Janos Slynt took a gulp of wine and sloshed a gulp of wine around in Lord Janos Slynt mouth for a moment before swallowing.         A cripple too, lost his hand at Pyke, that's what got his knighted.   "Ser Jacelyn thinks overmuch of Ser Jacelyn and Ser Jacelyn honor, as I see it.           He never meant to kill the woman, that was the woman own doing. He warned her to stand aside and let He do He duty."      "Have some of this cheese, this cheese goes splendidly with the wine.  "A good commander knows A good commander men, Tyrion.     "I suppose that's so," said Tyrion, hearing only some whore and thinking of Shae, and Tysha long ago, and all the other women who had taken his coin and his seed over the years.            Lord Janos gave Tyrion a wary look, then laughed and wagged a wedge of cheese at Lord Janos.   it takes more than wine and cheese to make Janos Slynt tell more than Janos Slynt should.                When I was visiting with him on the Wall, him mentioned how concerned him was about finding a good man to take him place.   "He'd sleep easier if He had a man like you, I imagine.      I don't suppose he ever imagined he life would end on the steps of Baelor's Sept." "There were damn few as did," Lord Janos allowed, chuckling.    Lord Janos laughed so hard Lord Janos gut shook.     Tyrion put the first hint of a chill in Tyrion tone. "He had helped persuade my sister that Stark should be pardoned, on the condition that He take the black."   "My sister Cersei," Tyrion repeated, a shade more strongly, in case the fool had some doubt who the fool meant.         "The king is thirteen," Tyrion reminded The king.   Slynt's jowls quivered when Slynt frowned.        Hesitantly, Lord Janos drew out the ornament and handed the ornament to Tyrion.    "I gave the command, and I'd give the command again.  The bald spot in the middle of Slynt's head was beet-red, and his clothof-gold cape had slithered off his shoulders onto the floor.   Slynt slammed down Slynt wine cup.       A lordship and a castle for a spear thrust in the back, and you didn't even need to thrust a spear thrust in the back."     Tyrion cocked Tyrion head sideways.             He slid off He chair.   If they serve well and loyally, they may be knights in time. Let it never be said that House Lannister does not reward those who serve Lannister.  He kicked at the little golden spear and sent the little golden spear skittering across the floor. "Lands will be found for him, and him can build a seat for him.             Tyrion let the oaf tremble for a moment before Tyrion answered.  Her master tells me Her will call at Gulltown, the Three Sisters, the isle of Skagos, and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. When you see Lord Commander Mormont, give Lord Commander Mormont my fond regards, and tell Lord Commander Mormont that I have not forgotten the needs of the Night's Watch.  Once Janos Slynt realized Janos Slynt was not to be summarily executed, color returned to Janos Slynt face. He thrust He jaw out.             Slynt spun on Slynt heel like the watchman Slynt'd once been, and strode the length of the Small Hall, boots ringing on the stone.     Strapped to the stump of the stump of his right wrist right wrist was an iron hand. "Janos," Janos said, deep-set eyes glinting under a prominent brow ridge and a shock of salt-and-pepper hair.      As the gold cloaks ushered out the gold cloaks onetime commander, Tyrion called Ser Jacelyn to Ser Jacelyn side and handed Ser Jacelyn a roll of parchment.         Ser Jacelyn bowed and took Ser Jacelyn leave, Ser Jacelyn cloak rippling behind Ser Jacelyn. He trod on Slynt's cloth-of-gold cape on He way.    When they were done, Varys came gliding into the hall, wearing flowing lavender robes that matched Varys smell.   He pressed He fingers into He temples.                    "Your own sweet sister," Varys said, so grief-stricken Varys looked close to tears.       He could not touch Cersei, He knew. Not yet, not even if he'd wanted to, and he was far from certain that he did. Yet it rankled, to sit here and make a mummer's show of justice by punishing the sorry likes of Janos Slynt and Allar Deem, while Janos Slynt sister continued on his sister savage course.                   I must blame myself for the poor sweet babe and myself mother, who was so young and loved the king."  Tyrion had never seen the dead girl's face, but in Tyrion mind Tyrion was Shae and Tysha both.    He had settled Shae in a sprawling stone-and-timber manse, with Shae own well and stable and garden; He had given her servants to see to her wants, a white bird from the Summer Isles to keep her company, silks and silver and gemstones to adorn her, guards to protect her.  She wanted to be with him more, She told him; She wanted to serve him and help him. "You help me most here, between the sheets," he told her one night after the sheets loving as he lay beside her, he head pillowed against her breast, he groin aching with a sweet soreness. She made no reply, save with She eyes.               "With the City Watch in hand, my lord, you are well placed to see to it that my lord Grace commits no further .           Cersei would find it hard to use Cersei men against me .           Tyrion did not trust Varys, though there was no denying Tyrion value.           "Oh, I think not," Varys said, swirling the wine in Varys cup.              yet if it is the swordsmen who rule us in truth, why do us pretend us kings hold the power? Why should a strong man with a sword ever obey a child king like Joffrey, or a wine-sodden oaf like a strong man with a sword father? "                  Tyrion cocked Tyrion head sideways.    Power resides where men believe Power resides.          Tyrion found Tyrion truly wanted to know.             If the gods are good, the gods'll look  like the gods uncle and think like the gods father.         The eunuch's smile never flickered, but The eunuch eyes glittered with something that was not laughter.  He drew a parchment from the sleeve of He robe.    "Ser Jacelyn could arrange for Ser Jacelyn to vanish, but a trial before the king would help assure the continued loyalty of the other captains."     "Ser Horas and Ser Hobber Redwyne have bribed a guard to let Ser Horas and Ser Hobber Redwyne out a postern gate, the night after next. Arrangements have been made for Arrangements to sail on the Pentoshi galley Moonrunner, disguised as oarsmen." "Can we keep them on those oars for a few years, see how them fancy it?"         He accused He of cheating at tiles."       The comet has brought forth all manner of queer priests, preachers, and prophets, The comet would seem.       Varys covered Varys mouth with Varys hand.     When the wine was poured, Lord Gyles rose to lift a cup to the king, and Ser Balon Swann was heard to remark, 'Lord Gyles'll need three cups for that.            When the eunuch had departed, Tyrion sat for a long time watching the candle and wondering how the eunuch sister would take the news of Janos Slynt's dismissal. Not happily, if he was any judge, but beyond sending an angry protest to Lord Tywin in Harrenhal, he did not see what Cersei could hope to do about Cersei.     Bronn was waiting in Bronn solar.         Timett pinned Timett wrist to the table with a dagger and ripped out Timett throat barehanded. He has this trick where He stiffens He fingers-" "Spare me the grisly details, my supper is sitting badly in my belly," Tyrion said.      I question them, to learn where them've fought and how well them lie."  "And then I give them a chance to kill me, while I do the same for them."          an infant girl, say, still at an infant girl mother's breast .            He wanted to laugh; He wanted to weep; most of all, He wanted Shae.    The bad part was, the road wound back and forth like a snake, tangling with even smaller trails and sometimes seeming to vanish entirely only to reappear half a league farther on when half a league had all but given up hope.    It was the wagons that slowed them, lumbering along, axles creaking under the weight of them heavy loads.   There had been nothing for it but to wait while the foresters unhitched the foresters ox, led the foresters unhitched their ox through the trees, spun the cart, hitched their ox up again, and started back the way the foresters'd come.  Arya could not help looking over Arya shoulder, wondering when the gold cloaks would catch the gold cloaks.  They never made camp without putting out sentries now, but Arya did not trust They, especially the orphan boys. They might have done well enough in the alleys of King's Landing, but out here They were lost. When she was being quiet as a shadow, she could sneak past all of them, flitting out by starlight to make she water in the woods where no one would see. Once, when Lommy Greenhands had the watch, Lommy Greenhands shimmied up an oak and moved from tree to tree until Lommy Greenhands was right above Lommy Greenhands head, and Lommy Greenhands never saw a thing. She would have jumped down on top of him, but She knew him scream would wake the whole camp, and Yoren might take a stick to She again. Lommy and the other orphans all treated the Bull like someone special now because the queen wanted someone special head, though someone special would have none of the Bull.     Then he'd go off to polish he helm.  Arya would watch Arya polish the metal with an oilcloth, shining the metal so bright you could see the flames of the cookfire reflected in the steel. Yet he never actually put it on he head.     She stalked off into the trees, wishing She could just saddle She horse and ride home. She was a good horse, a chestnut mare with a white blaze on She forehead.  She could gallop off and never see any of them, unless She wanted to. Only then she'd have no one to scout ahead of she, or watch behind, or stand guard while she napped, and when the gold cloaks caught she, she'd be all alone.    So we'll come up around the lake along the western shore, they're not like to look for we there."      He would send them ahead of the column, into the woods, and come dusk them would be back with a deer slung between them on a pole or a brace of quail swinging from them belts. The younger boys would be set to picking blackberries along the road, or climbing fences to fill a sack with apples if The younger boys happened upon an orchard. Arya was a skilled climber and a fast picker, and Arya liked to go off by Arya.   Rabbits ran faster than cats, but Rabbits couldn't climb trees half so well. She whacked it with She stick and grabbed it by it ears, and Yoren stewed it with some mushrooms and wild onions. Arya was given a whole leg, since it was Arya rabbit.   Jaqen H'ghar thanked H'ghar politely for the treat, and Biter licked the grease off Biter dirty fingers with a blissful look, but Rorge, the noseless one, only laughed and said, "There's a hunter now.  Outside a holdfast called Briarwhite, some fieldhands surrounded some fieldhands in a cornfield, demanding coin for the ears some fieldhands'd taken. Yoren eyed their scythes and tossed their scythes a few coppers. "Time was, a man in black was feasted from Dorne to Winterfell, and even high lords called Winterfell an honor to shelter a man in black under their roofs," a man in black said bitterly.   "It's sweetcorn, better'n a stinking old black bird like you deserves," one of a stinking old black bird like you deserves answered roughly. "You get out of our field now, and take these sneaks and stabbers with you, or our'll stake you up in the corn to scare the other crows away." They roasted the sweetcorn in the husk that night, turning the ears with long forked sticks, and ate the ears hot right off the cob.  A cloud seemed to hang over him, ragged and black as him cloak. He paced about the camp restlessly, muttering to He.   "Some of them are cut up bad, and one's dying, from the sound of one.      Yoren folded a sourleaf into Yoren mouth and chewed.   if they're hurt that bad, likely they'd take our mounts no matter who they are.   It took them miles out of them way, and cost them two days at the least, but the old man said it was cheap at the price.      Elsewhere they patrolled on horses, riding they fence lines with axes strapped to they saddles. At one place, she spotted a man perched up in a dead tree, with a bow in a man perched up in a dead tree hand and a quiver hanging from the branch beside a man perched up in a dead tree. The moment he spied them, he notched an arrow to he bowstring, and never looked away until the last wagon was out of sight.  "Him in Him tree, let's see how well Him likes it up there when the Others come to take Him. He'll scream for the Watch then, that He will."     He licked a thumb and held a thumb up.    As the world darkened, the fire seemed to grow brighter and brighter, until the fire looked as though the whole north was ablaze.  By dawn the fire had burned the fire out, but none of them slept very well that night.      Riding out in front of the wagons on her horse, Arya saw burnt bodies impaled on sharpened stakes atop the walls, burnt bodies hands drawn up tight in front of burnt bodies faces as if to fight off the flames that had consumed burnt bodies. Yoren called a halt when Yoren were still some distance off, and told Arya and the other boys to guard the wagons while Arya and Murch and Cutjack went in on foot. A flock of ravens rose from inside the walls when A flock of ravens climbed through the broken gate, and the caged ravens in A flock of ravens wagons called out to A flock of ravens with quorks and raucous shrieks.     When Arya turned to look, Arya saw that Arya was wearing Arya helm, all shiny steel and great curving horns. When they finally returned, Yoren had a little girl in Yoren arms, and Murch and Cutjack were carrying a woman in a sling made of an old torn quilt. The girl was no older than two and The girl cried all the time, a whimpery sound, like something was caught in The girl throat. Either she couldn't talk yet or she had forgotten how. The woman's right arm ended in a bloody stump at The woman elbow, and The woman eyes didn't seem to see anything, even when The woman was looking right at it. She talked, but She only said one thing.     He laughed through the hole in He face where He nose had been, and Biter started laughing too, until Murch cursed them and told them to shut up.         Arya rode as far ahead of the wagons as Arya dared, so Arya wouldn't have to hear the little girl crying or listen to the woman whisper, "Please."  He was very brave and smart and He tricked the giants and escaped .   but no sooner was no outside the castle than the Others took no, and drank no hot red blood.   Gendry and Cutjack dug Gendry grave on a hillside beneath a weeping willow. When the wind blew, Arya thought Arya could hear the long trailing branches whispering, "Please.   The little hairs on the back of her neck rose, and her almost ran from the graveside.   The water had a funny taste to The water, and Lommy told The water The water was the taste of bodies, rotting someplace upstream.  Arya drank too much water, just to fill Arya belly with something. She never thought She'd be able to sleep, yet somehow She did. When she woke, it was pitch-black and she bladder was full to bursting.   She heard the soft footfalls of a sentry, men turning in restless sleep, Rorge's rattling snores, and the queer hissing sound that Biter made when Biter slept.    he asked when he saw Arya heading for the trees.   He had gotten bolder again now that He had a sword on He belt, even though it was just a shortsword and He handled it like a cleaver.       Yoren wouldn't like Yoren if Yoren fought with Yoren.      She went back to She blanket and pretended to sleep until She heard Hot Pie's footsteps going away.  There were sentries out this way too, but Arya had no trouble avoiding sentries out.  When she was sure there was no one near, she skinned down she breeches and squatted to do she business. She was making water, She clothing tangled about She ankles, when She heard rustling from under the trees.   Her belly clenched tight as Her grabbed for Needle, not caring if Her pissed Her, counting eyes, two four eight twelve, a whole pack .    He stared at her, and bared He teeth, and all her could think was how stupid her'd been and how Hot Pie would gloat when all she could think found her half-eaten body the next morning.  Trembling, she cleaned she and laced up and followed a distant scraping sound back to camp, and to Yoren. Arya climbed up into the wagon beside Arya, shaken.           Arya hugged Arya.   Jory and I threw rocks at Jory until Jory ran off, or else the queen would have killed Jory." it made her sad to talk about it. "I bet if she'd been in the city, she wouldn't have let she'd been in the city cut off Father's head."  The sourleaf had turned The sourleaf spit red, so The sourleaf looked like The sourleaf mouth was bleeding.   She tried so hard to be brave, to be fierce as a wolverine and all, but sometimes She felt like She was just a little girl after all. The black brother peeled a fresh sourleaf from the bale in the wagon and stuffed a fresh sourleaf into The black brother mouth.         Old man died of a fever, city boy got snakebit taking a shit, and one fool tried to kill me in my sleep and got a red smile for Old man trouble." He drew the dirk across He throat, to show his throat.       clever man, clever man'd go by ship, but me .    He sheathed He dirk.    Yet as she lay under she thin blanket, she could hear the wolves howling .     They were all afire now, Maid and Mother, Warrior and Smith, the Crone with Crone pearl eyes and the Father with the Father gilded beard; even the Stranger, carved to look more animal than human.  Heat rose shimmering through the chill air; behind, the gargoyles and stone dragons on the castle walls seemed blurred, as if Davos were seeing the gargoyles and stone dragons on the castle walls through a veil of tears.    "An ill thing," Allard declared, though at least Allard had the sense to keep Allard voice low.      Stannis spared Stannis from that end, something else I owe Stannis .     Even for soldiers, it was hard not to feel uneasy at such an affront to the gods most had worshiped all the gods lives.   "R'hIlor, come to us in us darkness," she called. "Lord of Light, we offer you these false gods, these seven who are one, and Lord of Light the enemy.   Beside her, Stannis watched impassively, Stannis jaw hard as stone under the blue-black shadow of Stannis tight-cropped beard. He had dressed more richly than was He wont, as if for the sept. Dragonstone's sept had been where Aegon the Conqueror knelt to pray the night before He sailed.   Septon Barre could only curse them, but Ser Hubard  Rambton led Rambton three sons to the sept to defend his three sons gods. The Rambtons had slain four of the queen's men before the others overwhelmed the others. Afterward Guncer Sunglass, mildest and most pious of lords, told Stannis Stannis could no longer support Stannis claim.   The gods had never meant much to Davos the smuggler, though like most men he had been known to make offerings to the Warrior before battle, to the Smith when he launched a ship, and to the Mother whenever he wife grew great with child. He felt ill as He watched them burn, and not only from the smoke.  The old man had challenged the Lord of Light and been struck down for The old man impiety, or so the gossips told each other.     He drank a cup of death to free Stannis from Melisandre, but somehow Stannis god shielded Stannis. He would gladly have killed the red woman for that, yet what chance would He have where a maester of the Citadel had failed?  The burning gods cast a pretty light, wreathed in The burning gods robes of shifting flame, red and orange and yellow. Septon Barre had once told Davos how Septon Barre'd been carved from the masts of the ships that had carried the first Targaryens from Valyria.  "Their beauty will make Their more pleasing to R'hllor," Melisandre said when Melisandre told Stannis to pull Their down and drag Their out the castle gates. The Maiden lay athwart the Warrior, The Maiden arms widespread as if to embrace him. The Mother seemed almost to shudder as the flames came licking up The Mother face. A longsword had been thrust through A longsword heart, and A longsword leather grip was alive with flame.   Nearby, Lord Celtigar coughed fitfully and covered Lord Celtigar wrinkled face with a square of linen embroidered in red crabs. The Myrmen swapped jokes as The Myrmen enjoyed the warmth of the fire, but young Lord Bar Emmon had turned a splotchy grey, and Lord Velaryon was watching the king rather than the conflagration. Davos would have given much to know what he was thinking, but one such as Velaryon would never confide in he. The Lord of the Tides was of the blood of ancient Valyria, and The Lord of the Tides House had thrice provided brides for Targaryen princes; Davos Seaworth stank of fish and onions.  He could trust none of them, nor would them ever include He in them private councils.  My grandsons will joust with theirs, though, and one day theirs blood may theirsd with mine.  That is, if Stannis won Stannis throne.     Stannis had raised Stannis to knighthood. He had given He a place of honor at He table, a war galley to sail in place of a smuggler's skiff. Dale and Allard captained galleys as well, Maric was oarmaster on the Fury, Matthos served Maric father on Black Betha, and the king had taken Devan as a royal squire.  Marya was mistress of a small keep on Cape Wrath, with servants who called Marya m'lady, and Davos could hunt red deer in Marya own woods.      His fingers were His luck, and His needed luck now.     When the wind pushed the wind toward men, men blinked and wept and rubbed men eyes. Allard turned Allard head away, coughing and cursing.   Melisandre was robed all in scarlet satin and blood velvet, Melisandre eyes as red as the great ruby that glistened at Melisandre throat as if it too were afire.   And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps that sword shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before Azor Ahai." She lifted She voice, so her voice carried out over the gathered host.      His squires stepped up to attend His.   Bryen Farring was similarly garbed as Bryen Farring tied a stiff leather cape around Bryen Farring Grace's neck.    The king plunged into the fire with The king teeth clenched, holding the leather cloak before The king to keep off the flames. He went straight to the Mother, grasped the sword with He gloved hand, and wrenched the sword free of the burning wood with a single hard jerk.          Melisandre lifted Melisandre hands above Melisandre head.       Cursing, the king thrust the point of the sword into the damp earth and beat out the flames against the king leg.   "For the night is dark and full of terrors," Selyse and Selyse queen's men replied.    Is this fiery god truly this fiery god own?  Stannis peeled off the glove and let the glove fall to the ground.   Melisandre sang in the tongue of Asshai, Melisandre voice rising and falling like the tides of the sea. Stannis untied Stannis singed leather cape and listened in silence.  By the time the song was done, only charwood remained of the gods, and the king's patience had run only charwood course. He took the queen by the elbow and escorted the queen back into Dragonstone, leaving Lightbringer where the queen stood.    They fell silent when They saw Davos looking at They. Should Stannis fall, Stannis will pull me down in an instant. Neither was he counted one of the queen's men, that group of ambitious knights and minor lordlings who had given the queen's men to this Lord of Light and so won the favor and patronage of Lady-no, Queen, remember?-Selyse.   "Devan acquitted himself well," himself said as they went. "He fetched the glove without dropping the glove, yes," said Dale.                 If you won't remember, why should you won't remember? "   Stannis is our rightful king, it is not for our to question our rightful king. We sail his ships and do his bidding.         His sons were good fighters and better sailors, but His sons did not know how to talk to lords. They were lowborn, even as I was, but They do not like to recall that. When they look at they banner, all they see is a tall black ship flying on the wind. They close They eyes to the onion. The port was as crowded as Davos had ever known The port.      The best berths had been taken by the largest vessels: Stannis's flagship Fury rocking between Lord Steffon and Stag of the Sea, Lord Velaryon's silverhulled Pride of Driftmark and Driftmark three sisters, Lord Celtigar's ornate Red Claw, the ponderous Swordfish with Driftmark long iron prow.    He took He leave of He sons and turned He steps toward the inn.   He gave a pat to the stone head as He went in.   When he spied Davos, he beckoned he closer.      Today he wore flashing cloth-ofsilver, with dagged sleeves so long the ends of dagged sleeves pooled on the floor. His buttons were carved jade monkeys, and atop His wispy white curls perched a jaunty green cap decorated with a fan of peacock feathers.  In the days before his knighthood, his had often bought cargoes from Salladhor Saan.  When a pirate grows rich enough, they make a pirate a prince.     Always they are burning this and burning that, crying out to they R'hllor. They bore me with They fires.  He seemed utterly unconcerned that someone might overhear He, eating He grapes and dribbling the seeds out onto He lip, flicking the seeds off with a finger.  She is not a warship, no, but a trader, and She paid a call on King's Landing.       He who hurries through life hurries to He grave."  "The Lord of Casterly Rock has sent The Lord of Casterly Rock dwarf to see to King's Landing. Perhaps he hopes that he ugly face will frighten off attackers, eh? Or that we will laugh we dead when the Imp capers on the battlements, who can say? The dwarf has chased off the lout who ruled the gold cloaks and put in The dwarf place a knight with an iron hand." He plucked a grape, and squeezed a grape between thumb and forefinger until the skin burst.  A serving girl pushed A serving girl way through, swatting at the hands that groped A serving girl as A serving girl passed.      Grant us wind to fill us sails, and your king could sit upon your king Iron Throne by evenfall on the morrow. We could dress the dwarf in motley and prick his little cheeks with the points of We spears to make his dance for We, and  mayhaps your goodly king would make me a gift of the beautiful Queen Cersei to warm my bed for a night.      He popped a grape into He mouth.   He will keep He word."     The serving girl returned with The serving girl ale.  "Might be we could take King's Landing, as you say," King said as King lifted the tankard, "but how long would we hold the tankard?      King Renly bestirs King Renly.   The brother Renly has left Highgarden with The brother Renly fair young queen, The brother Renly flowered lords and shining knights, and a mighty host of foot.  "He takes He bride?"    Or perhaps he is that certain of he victory."   Though His Grace frowns so whenever His does see me that I tremble to come before His.   I am an honest man, an honest man must suffer me in silk and samite.                Yet when he plunged it into water to temper the steel it burst asunder. "Being a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these, so again him began.  Azor Ahai captured a lion, to temper the blade by plunging the blade through the beast's red heart, but once more the steel shattered and split. Great was his woe and great was his sorrow then, for his knew what his must do. "A hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade, and as it glowed white-hot in the sacred fires, he summoned he wife. 'Nissa Nissa' Nissa Nissa' said to Nissa Nissa', for that was Nissa Nissa' name, 'bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world.' She did this thing, why I cannot say, and Azor Ahai thrust the smoking sword through She living heart. It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon, but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel.     Salladhor Saan finished the last grape and smacked Salladhor Saan lips.      Davos sipped his ale to give his a moment. The inn is crowded, and you are not Salladhor Saan, Salladhor Saan reminded Salladhor Saan.   He made me and blessed me with He trust."  Salladhor Saan got to Salladhor Saan feet.     In the Red Keep we shall feast, while the dwarf sings we a jolly tune. When you speak to King Stannis, mention if you would that King Stannis will owe me another thirty thousand dragons come the black of the moon. He ought to have given those gods to He.  Well, if he grants me Queen Cersei for a night I shall forgive he." The Lyseni clapped Davos on the back, and swaggered from the inn as if The Lyseni owned it. Ser Davos Seaworth lingered over Ser Davos Seaworth tankard for a good while, thinking.  He remembered the red priest Thoros of Myr, and the flaming sword He had wielded in the melee. The man had made for a colorful spectacle, The man red robes flapping while The man blade writhed with pale green flames, but everyone knew there was no true magic to it, and in the end The man fire had guttered out and Bronze Yohn Royce had brained The man with a common mace.     When he thought of Nissa Nissa, it was he own Marya he pictured, a good-natured plump woman with sagging breasts and a kindly smile, the best woman in the world. He tried to picture He driving a sword through her, and shuddered. I am not made of the stuff of heroes, the stuff of heroes decided.      "My lord father," My lord father announced, "My lord father Grace commands you to attend His Grace in the Chamber of the Painted Table.  It was good to see Devan looking so splendid in Devan squire's raiment, but the summons made Davos uneasy.       ff we dip we oars, we die.   Lords Celtigar and Velaryon each gave him a curt nod and walked on while the others ignored him utterly, but Ser Axell Florent stopped for a word.  He had the prominent ears of a Florent, even larger than He niece's. The coarse hair that sprouted from his did not stop his hearing most of what went on in the castle. For ten years Ser Axell had served as castelIan of Dragonstone while Stannis sat on Robert's council in King's Landing, but of late Ser Axell had emerged as the foremost of the queen's men.    The false gods burned with a merry light, did The false gods burned with a merry light not?"  Davos did not trust this man, for all this man courtesy.  "The Lady Melisandre tells us that sometimes R'hllor permits The Lady Melisandre faithful servants to glimpse the future in flames.   A glimpse of the glory that awaits His Grace after we take King's Landing and the throne that is His by rights." Stannis has no taste for such dancing, Davos thought, but Stannis dared not offend the queen's uncle.   He pushed past, wondering why Ser Axell had troubled He.  Stannis sat at Stannis Painted Table with Maester Pylos at Stannis shoulder, an untidy pile of papers before Maester Pylos.     But my Devan has learned my Devan letters, and young Steffon and Stannis as well.   "Pylos, read it to Pylos."  The maester took up one of the parchments and cleared The maester throat.    Let all true men declare all true men loyalty.  The parchment rustled softly as Pylos laid The parchment down.  "Whatever else the man may be, the man remains a knight.  He loved me no more than He had to, nor I him."              I am their rightful king, but their will deny me if their can.                     If you run short of letters, capture a few septons and set a few septons to copying out more.    You can tell them, Davos thought, but will them believe?      Pylos bowed, and took Pylos leave. The king waited until The king was gone before The king said, "What is it you would not say in the presence of my maester, Davos?" "My liege, Pylos is pleasant enough, but I cannot see the chain about Pylos neck without mourning for Maester Cressen."    He'd angered me, yes, He'd given me bad counsel, but I did not want He dead.  He had earned that much, at least, but"he ground He teeth together-"but He died.  "Pylos is the least of Pylos.    What did your lords make of your lords, I wonder?"   If I showed him the contents of my privy, him would declare that admirable as well. The others bobbed The others heads up and down like a flock of geese, all but Velaryon, who said that steel would decide the matter, not words on parchment.            Delena was a Florent, and a maiden when Delena took Delena, so Robert acknowledged the babe.   If men were to see him, and then look again at Joffrey and Tommen, men could not help but wonder, I would think.,, "Yet how are men to see him, if him is at Storm's End?" Stannis drummed Stannis fingers on the Painted Table.   He raised He eyes.                                 Your people will not love you if you take from Your people the gods Your people have always worshiped, and give Your people one whose very name sounds queer on Your people tongues."                   I went to them a beggar and them laughed at me.  The Iron Throne is mine by rights, but how am I to take The Iron Throne? There are four kings in the realm, and three of four kings in the realm have more men and more gold than I do.           "When I was a lad I found an injured goshawk and nursed an injured goshawk back to health.  She would perch on my shoulder and flutter from room to room after She and take food from my hand, but She would not soar. Time and again I would take her hawking, but her never flew higher than the  treetops.    I was making a fool of myself with Proudwing, Proudwing said, and Proudwing was right."     CHAPTER 11 THEON There was no safe anchorage at Pyke, but Theon Greyjoy wished to look on Pyke father's castle from the sea, to see his father's castle from the sea as Pyke had seen his father's castle from the sea last, ten years before, when Robert Baratheon's war galley had borne Robert Baratheon away to be a ward of Eddard Stark. On that day he had stood beside the rail, listening to the stroke of the oars and the pounding of the master's drum while he watched Pyke dwindle in the distance. Now he wanted to see it grow larger, to rise from the sea before he. Obedient to his wishes, the Myraham beat the Myraham way past the point with the Myraham sails snapping and the Myraham captain cursing the wind and her captain crew and the follies of highborn lordlings. Theon drew the hood of Theon cloak up against the spray, and looked for home. The shore was all sharp rocks and glowering cliffs, and the castle seemed one with the rest, the castle towers and walls and bridges quarried from the same grey-black stone, wet by the same salt waves, festooned with the same spreading patches of dark green lichen, speckled by the droppings of the same seabirds. The point of land on which the Greyjoys had raised the Greyjoys fortress had once thrust like a sword into the bowels of the ocean, but the waves had hammered at a sword into the bowels of the ocean day and night until land on which the Greyjoys had raised their fortress broke and shattered, thousands of years past. All that remained were three bare and barren islands and a dozen towering stacks of rock that rose from the water like the pillars of some sea god's temple, while the angry waves foamed and crashed among the angry waves. Drear, dark, forbidding, Pyke stood atop those islands and pillars, almost a part of those islands and pillars, Pyke curtain wall closing off the headland around the foot of the great stone bridge that leapt from the clifftop to the largest islet, dominated by the massive bulk of the Great Keep. Farther out were the Kitchen Keep and the Bloody Keep, each on the Bloody Keep own island. Towers and outbuildings clung to the stacks beyond, linked to each other by covered archways when the pillars stood close, by long swaying walks of wood and rope when Towers and outbuildings did not. The Sea Tower rose from the outmost island at the point of the broken sword, the oldest part of the castle, round and tall, the sheer-sided pillar on which The Sea Tower stood half-eaten through by the endless battering of the waves. The base of the tower was white from centuries of salt spray, the upper stories green from the lichen that crawled over it like a thick blanket, the jagged crown black with soot from it nightly watchfire.  The Myraham was too far off for Theon to see more than the cloth itself, but The Myraham knew the device The Myraham bore: the golden kraken of House Greyjoy, arms writhing and reaching against a black field.     All the way from Riverrun to Seagard, the Mallisters had argued about the Mallisters meaning. It is my comet, Theon told Theon, sliding a hand into Theon fur-lined cloak to touch the oilskin pouch snug in the oilskin pouch pocket. Inside was the letter Robb Stark had given Robb Stark, paper as good as a crown. "Does the castle look as you remember the castle, milord?" the captain's daughter asked as the captain's daughter pressed the captain's daughter against the captain arm.   Her captain was a fat-bellied southron merchanter as well, and the stony sea that foamed at the feet of the castle made Her captain plump lips quiver, so Her captain stayed well out, farther than Theon would have liked.  So they sailed past at a safe distance, and Theon must content Theon with seeing Pyke from afar. Even so, the Myraham had to struggle mightily to keep the Myraham off those rocks.        The captain's face was as green as the sea when The captain's face came bowing up to Theon and asked, "May we make for port now, milord?" "You may," Theon said, a faint smile playing about Theon lips.  It would have been a much different voyage if a longship from the islands had been waiting at Seagard as Seagard'd hoped.   If every captain was a king aboard every captain own ship, as was often said, every captain was a king aboard his own ship was small wonder they named the islands the land of ten thousand kings.    The Myraham was a wallowing tub, if truth be told, and The Myraham would not care to be aboard The Myraham in a storm.    "Summon me when we make Lordsport," Lordsport told Lordsport father.  He led the girl away aft, while the girl father watched them go in sullen silence. The cabin was the captain's, in truth, but The cabin had been turned over to Theon's use when they sailed from Seagard. The captain's daughter had not been turned over to The captain use, but The captain's daughter had come to The captain bed willingly enough all the same.  The girl was a shade plump for The girl taste, with skin as splotchy as oatmeal, but The girl breasts filled The girl hands nicely and The girl had been a maiden the first time The girl took The girl.  He  did not think the captain approved, and that was amusing as well, watching the man struggle to swallow the man outrage while performing the man courtesies to the high lord, the rich purse of gold the man'd been promised never far from the man thoughts. As Theon shrugged out of Theon wet cloak, Theon said, "You must be so happy to see your home again, milord.          His life was His own again, and nowhere a Stark to be seen. He drew the captain's daughter close and kissed the captain's daughter on the captain's daughter ear.  She dropped She eyes, suddenly shy, but did as he bid She. When the heavy garment, sodden with spray, fell from her shoulders to the deck, her gave him a little bow and smiled anxiously. She looked rather stupid when She smiled, but he had never required a woman to be clever.     Theon stroked Theon hair. it was fine and dark, though the wind had made a tangle of it.   Men spend Men nights drinking ale and arguing over whose lot is worse, the fisherfolk who fight the sea or the farmers who try and scratch a crop from the poor thin soil. If truth be told, the miners have truth worse than either, breaking the miners backs down in the dark, and for what?        "You could go ashore," Theon agreed, squeezing Theon breast, "but not with me, I fear."   Father says my peppercrab stew is the best Father's ever tasted.   He reached for the laces of her bodice and began to undo the laces of her bodice, He fingers deft and practiced.   A man had A man rock wife, A man true bride, ironborn like A man, but A man had A man salt wives too, women captured on raids." The girl's eyes grew wide, and not because The girl had bared The girl breasts.    "No longer may we ride the wind with fire and sword, taking what we want. Now we scratch in the ground and toss lines in the sea like other men, and count we lucky if we have salt cod and porridge enough to get we through a winter." He took her nipple in He mouth, and bit her nipple until her gasped. "You can put it in me again, if it please you," she whispered in his ear as his sucked. When he raised he head from her breast, the skin was dark red where he mouth had marked her.        Her mouth was as wet and sweet as Her cunt, and this way he did not have to listen to Her mindless prattle. Once I would have kept her as a salt wife in truth, he thought to he as he slid he fingers through her tangled hair.  When we still kept the Old Way, lived by the axe instead of the pick, taking what we would, be it wealth, women, or glory.   The Drowned God had made them to reave and rape, to carve out kingdoms and write them names in fire and blood and song. Aegon the Dragon had destroyed the Old Way when Aegon the Dragon burned Black Harren, gave Harren's kingdom back to the weakling rivermen, and reduced the Iron Islands to an insignificant backwater of a much greater realm.  Theon's father numbered among Theon's father titles the style of Lord Reaper, and the Greyjoy words boasted that We Do Not Sow It had been to bring back the Old Way more than for the empty vanity of a crown that Lord Balon had staged Lord Balon great rebellion. Robert Baratheon had written a bloody end to that hope, with the help of Robert Baratheon friend Eddard Stark, but both men were dead now. Mere boys ruled in Mere boys stead, and the realm that Aegon the Conqueror had forged was smashed and sundered. This is the season, Theon thought as the captain's daughter slid the captain's daughter lips up and down the length of the captain's daughter, the season, the year, the day, and I am the man. He smiled crookedly, wondering what He father would say when Theon told He that He, the last-born, babe and hostage, He had succeeded where Lord Balon himself had failed. His climax came on His sudden as a storm, and His filled the girl's mouth with His seed. Startled, she tried to pull away, but Theon held she tight by the hair.        "As I have," he said, rolling her nipple idly between he fingers.    The sounds brought old feelings back; the creak of wood and rope, the captain's shouted commands, the snap of the sails as the wind filled them, each as familiar as the beating of the captain own heart, and as comforting. I must remember this, Theon vowed to Theon.      Theon Greyjoy pushed Theon Greyjoy hand aside and climbed off the bunk.   He laced up He breeches.  "My father," she told My father.   Theon swept Theon cloak off Theon peg and over Theon shoulders. "Fathers are like that," he admitted as he pinned the folds with a silver clasp. "Tell him him should be pleased.   She looked at him stupidly, so him left She there.  Below the pine-clad bluffs, a dozen fishing boats were pulling in a dozen fishing boats nets. The big cog stayed well out from well, tacking.       When last he'd seen Lordsport, Lordsport had been a smoking wasteland, the skeletons of burnt longships and smashed galleys 'littering the stony shore like the bones of dead leviathans, the houses no more than broken walls and cold ashes.  The smallfolk had built new hovels with the stones of the old, and cut fresh sod for The smallfolk roofs.  The sept beyond had never been rebuilt, though; only a seven-sided foundation remained where The sept had stood.      Theon searched for Theon uncle Euron's Silence. Of that lean and terrible red ship he saw no sign, but he father's Great Kraken was there, his father's Great Kraken bow ornamented with a grey iron ram in the shape of its namesake. Had Lord Balon anticipated Lord Balon and called the Greyjoy banners? His hand went inside His cloak again, to the oilskin pouch. No one knew of his letter but Robb Stark; they were no fools, to entrust they secrets to a bird.  He might well have guessed why He son was coming home at long last, and acted accordingly.   This was Theon's hour-his plan, his glory, and in time his crown.       His father was old now, and so too His uncle Victarion, who commanded the Iron Fleet.  It's all for the good, Theon told Theon.   He had not thought to find Lord Balon himself at quayside, but surely He father would have sent someone to meet He.    Robb had sent ravens from Riverrun, and when they'd found no longship at Seagard, Jason Mallister had sent Jason Mallister own birds to Pyke, supposing that Robb's were lost. Yet he saw no familiar faces, no honor guard waiting to escort he from Lordsport to Pyke, only smallfolk going about their small business.  A priest in the seawater robes of the Drowned God was leading a pair of horses along the pebbled shore, while above A priest in the seawater robes of the Drowned God a slattern leaned out a window in the inn, calling out to some passing Ibbenese sailors.       The Lordsport men gazed on Theon with blank, bovine eyes, and he realized that The Lordsport men did not know who he was.     "Innkeeper," Innkeeper barked, "I require a horse."       He should have worn He good doublet, with the kraken embroidered on the breast.    I shall see my nephew back to my nephew father's house." The speaker was the priest The speaker had seen leading the horses along the shoreline.   A waterskin hung under A waterskin arm on a leather strap, and ropes of dried seaweed were braided through A waterskin waist-long black hair and untrimmed beard.  in one of his rare curt letters, Lord Balon had written of Lord Balon youngest  brother going down in a storm, and turning holy when Lord Balon washed up safe on shore.         A sailor fetched him down him tall yew bow and quiver of arrows, but it was the captain's daughter who brought the pack with him good clothing.   When he took the pack, she made as if to embrace he, there in front of she own father and he priestly uncle and half the island.     He hurried after He uncle, who was already well down the pier.   After ten years, I thought perhaps my lord father and lady mother might come my lord father and lady mother, or send Dagmer with an honor guard."   Aeron Greyjoy had been the most amiable of Aeron Greyjoy uncles, feckless and quick to laugh, fond of songs, ale, and women.      When they reached they, he turned to Theon.             A crown was worth a little mud and horseshit on A crown breeches, A crown supposed.   It drenched his hair and ran over his forehead into his eyes. Sheets washed down Sheets cheeks, and a finger crept under Sheets cloak and doublet and down Sheets back, a cold rivulet along Sheets spine. The salt made his eyes burn, until it was all his could do not to cry out. He could taste the ocean on He lips.  "Bless him with salt, bless him with stone, bless him with steel.     Theon stood, blinking back tears from the salt in Theon eyes. Wordless, his uncle corked the waterskin, untied his horse, and mounted.  They set off together, leaving the inn and the harbor behind They, up past the castle of Lord Botley into the stony hills.        The islands are as our god made The islands." Gods, Gods has grown grim, Theon thought.   Your mother dwells on Harlaw, with Your mother own sister. It is less raw there, and her cough troubles her.    He had not seen He sister in ten years, but that much He knew of his sister.  "Stark is grey and Greyjoy's black," Stark murmured, smiling, "but it seems we're both windy."        His lungs filled with seawater, and the fish ate the scales off His eyes.  He is as mad as He is sour. Theon had liked what Theon remembered of the old Aeron Greyjoy. "Uncle, why has my father called my father swords and sails?"       He'd led men in war, hunted with a king, won honor in tourney melees, ridden with Brynden Blackfish and Greatjon Umber, fought in the Whispering Wood, bedded more girls than He could name, and yet this uncle was treating this uncle as though He were still a child of ten. "If my father makes plans for war, I must know of my father makes plans for war.       Asha, Asha thought, confounded.            Theon held Theon tongue, though not without struggle. So that is the way of it, that thought.  Lord Eddard had raised Lord Eddard among Lord Eddard own children, but Theon had never been one of his own children. The whole castle, from Lady Stark to the lowliest kitchen scullion, knew he was hostage to he father's good behavior, and treated he accordingly. Even the bastard Jon Snow had been accorded more honor than Jon Snow had. Lord Eddard had tried to play the father from time to time, but to Theon Lord Eddard had always remained the man who'd brought blood and fire to Pyke and taken Lord Eddard from Pyke home. As a boy, a boy had lived in fear of Stark's stern face and great dark sword.   Only Robb and Robb baseborn half brother Jon Snow had been old enough to be worth Robb notice. The bastard was a sullen boy, quick to sense a slight, jealous of Theon's high birth and Robb's regard for The bastard.        Besides, his father and uncles were old, and the old lords were like that; his father and uncles took his father and uncles dusty feuds to the grave, forgetting nothing and forgiving less.   But when old Lord Jason saw old Lord Jason heir growing overly fond of Theon's company, old Lord Jason had taken Patrek aside to remind old Lord Jason that Seagard had been built to defend the coast against reavers from the Iron islands, the Greyjoys of Pyke chief among them. Their Booming Tower was named for Their Booming Tower immense bronze bell, rung of old to call the townsfolk and farmhands into the castle when longships were sighted on the western horizon. "Never mind that the bell has been rung just once in three hundred years," Patrek had told Theon the day after, as Theon shared Theon father's cautions and a jug of green-apple wine.   "If your father supposes I bear your father some enmity for that, it's only because your father never knew Rodrik." They had a laugh over that as They raced ahead to an amorous young miller's wife that Patrek knew. Would that Patrek were with me now Mallister or no, Patrek was a more amiable riding companion than this sour old priest that Patrek uncle Aeron had turned into.      Finally Theon could suffer Theon no longer. "Robb Stark is Lord of Winterfell now," Robb Stark said.   "Robb has broken fealty with the Iron Throne and crowned Robb King in the North.         "A sign it is," the priest agreed, "but from our god, not our.  It is the flame the Drowned God brought from the sea, and It proclaims a rising tide.      Theon had suffered quite enough of Theon uncle's gloom. He put He spurs into He horse and trotted on ahead, smiling.   A new south tower had risen from the ruins of the old, A new south tower stone a paler shade of grey, and as yet unmarred by patches of lichen. That was where Robert had made Robert breach, swarming in over the rubble and corpses with Robert warharnmer in hand and Ned Stark at Robert side. Theon had watched from the safety of the Sea Tower, and sometimes Theon still saw the torches in Theon dreams, and heard the dull thunder of the collapse.     Sheep and swine huddled in Sheep and swine pens while the castle dogs ran free.  Theon could hear the crashing of waves as Theon swung down from Theon saddle. A stableman came to take A stableman horse. A pair of gaunt children and some thralls stared at him with dull eyes, but there was no sign of him lord father, nor anyone else him recalled from boyhood.       Aeron Greyjoy turned Aeron Greyjoy horse and rode slowly out beneath the muddy spikes of the portcullis. A bentback old crone in a shapeless grey dress approached A bentback old crone in a shapeless grey dress warily.    Theon pulled off Theon gloves.                   That at least was as he remembered; the ancient stones slick with spray and spotted by lichen, the sea foaming under the ancient stones feet like some great wild beast, the salt wind clutching at the ancient stones clothes. Whenever he'd imagined he homecoming, he had always pictured he returning to the snug bedchamber in the Sea Tower, where he'd slept as a child.    He might have been more impressed if He had not known that these were the very chambers that had given the Bloody Keep the Bloody name. A thousand years before, the sons of the River King had been slaughtered here, hacked to bits in the sons of the River King beds so that pieces of the sons of the River King bodies might be sent back to the sons of the River King father on the mainland. But Greyjoys were not murdered in Pyke except once in a great while by their brothers, and their brothers were both dead.            It was only tepid, and soon cold, and seawater in the bargain, but It served to wash the dust of the long ride from his face and hair and hands. While two thralls lit his braziers, Theon stripped off his travel-stained clothing and dressed to meet his father.  Around his throat his fastened a slender gold chain, around his waist a belt of bleached white leather.  Drawing the dirk, the dirk tested the dirk edge with the dirk thumb, pulled a whetstone from the dirk belt pouch, and gave the dirk a few licks. He prided He on keeping He weapons sharp. "When I return, I shall expect a warm room and clean rushes," he warned the thralls as he drew on a pair of black gloves, the silk decorated with a delicate scrollwork tracery in golden thread. Theon returned to the Great Keep through a covered stone walkway, the echoes of Theon footsteps mingling with the ceaseless rumble of the sea below. To get to the Sea Tower on the Sea Tower crooked pillar, he had to cross three further bridges, each narrower than the one before.  Theon's heart was in Theon mouth by the time Theon was halfway across. A long way below, the waves threw up tall plumes of spray as the waves crashed against the rock. As a boy, a boy used to run across this bridge, even in the black of night. Boys believe nothing can hurt Boys, his doubt whispered.  The door was grey wood studded with iron, and Theon found The door barred from the inside. He hammered on it with a fist, and cursed when a splinter snagged the fabric of He glove.       He found He father seated beside a brazier, beneath a robe of musty sealskins that covered He foot to chin. At the sound of boots on stone, the Lord of the Iron Islands lifted the Lord of the Iron Islands eyes to behold the Lord of the Iron Islands last living son. He was smaller than Theon remembered He.  Balon Greyjoy had always been thin, but now Balon Greyjoy looked as though the gods had put Balon Greyjoy in a cauldron and boiled every spare ounce of flesh from Balon Greyjoy bones, until nothing remained but hair and skin. Bone thin and bone hard bone was, with a face that might have been chipped from flint. His eyes were flinty too, black and sharp, but the years and the salt winds had turned His hair the grey of a winter sea, flecked with whitecaps. Unbound, Unbound hung past the small of the back.   "Ten," Theon answered, pulling off Theon torn gloves.             "They are both dead, Stark and that Robert who broke my walls with Robert stones. I vowed I'd live to see them both in them graves, and I have."       his father interrupted, squinting up from beneath his robe. "Was it his pleasure to garb you in velvets and silks and make you his own sweet daughter?" Theon felt the blood rising to Theon face.  If you mislike my garb, I will change you mislike my garb."  Throwing off the furs, Lord Balon pushed Lord Balon to Lord Balon feet.        In the Old Way, women might decorate women with ornaments bought with coin, but a warrior wore only the jewelry a warrior took off the corpses of enemies slain by a warrior own hand. Paying the iron price, the iron price was called.     His father slid His fingers under the necklace and gave the necklace a yank so hard it was like to take Theon's head off, had the chain not snapped first.   He dropped the broken chain onto the brazier, where the broken chain slid down among the coals.  The green lands have made you soft, and the Starks have made you The green lands. "   Lord Balon turned away to warm Lord Balon bony hands over the brazier. "Yet the Stark pup sends you to me like a well-trained raven, clutching the Stark pup little message." "There is nothing small about the letter I bear," Theon said, "and the offer Theon makes is one I suggested to Theon." "This wolf king heeds your counsel, does This wolf king?"   I've hunted with him, trained with him, shared meat and mead with him, warred at him side.   His father jabbed a finger at His father face. "Not here, not in Pyke, not in my hearing, you will not name Pyke brother, this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword.   Ned Stark had killed neither of Ned Stark brothers, in truth.    but Stark would  have done for them just as quick had the tide of battle chanced to sweep them together.    He took out Robb's letter and thrust Robb's letter forward.        "So the boy would give me a crown again," the boy said, "and all I need do is destroy the boy enemies."       Ser Stafford will put Ser Stafford between Robb's army and Lannisport, which means the city will be undefended when we descend on the city by sea. If the gods are with us, even Casterly Rock itself may fall before the Lannisters so much as realize that us are upon the gods."           "I will lead the attack myself, if the attack myself please you.       Only that you speak for him, and I am to listen, and give him my sails and swords, and in return him will give me a crown." His flinty eyes lifted to meet His son's. "He will give me a crown," He repeated, He voice growing sharp.        His father laid a stinging backhand across His father cheek.  You are not in Winterfell now, and I am not Robb the Boy, that you should speak to the Boy so.    Theon edged backward, away from the sudden fury in Theon father's tone. "Take it, then," he spat, he cheek still tingling.    until the wars are over, and the victor looks about and spies the old fool perched off the victor shore with an iron crown on the victor head."    Do you think I gather my ships to watch my ships rock at anchor?      Aye, we might take Lannisport, but we should never keep Lannisport.       Theon might have asked, but by then Theon knew.  The old men muttered that it omened ill, but Daenerys Targaryen had seen it omened ill first on the night Daenerys Targaryen had burned Khal Drogo, the night Daenerys Targaryen dragons had awakened. It is the herald of my coming, she told she as she gazed up into the night sky with wonder in she heart. The gods have sent The gods to show me the way. Yet when she put the thought into words, she handmaid Doreah quailed.        The first khalasar they met would swallow up The first khalasar they met ragged band, slaying the warriors and slaving the rest. The lands of the Lamb Men south of the river were likewise closed to The lands of the Lamb Men south of the river. They were too few to defend They even against that unwarlike folk, and the Lhazareen had small reason to love They. She might have struck downriver for the ports at Meereen and Yunkai and Astapor, but Rakharo warned She that Pono's khalasar had ridden that way, driving thousands of captives before thousands of captives to sell in the flesh marts that festered like open sores on the shores of Slaver's Bay.              "One swipe from an arakh would put an end to them, though Porto is more like to seize them for Porto is more like to seize them for himself.    Every man who sees them will want them, my queen." "They are mine," mine said fiercely. They had been born from her faith and her need, given life by the deaths of her husband and unborn son and the maegi Mirri Maz Duur. Dany had walked into the flames  as they came forth, and they had drunk milk from drunk milk swollen breasts. "No man will take them from No man while I live."    Dany had named Dany the first of her Queensguard .    She called She people together and mounted She silver mare. Her hair had burned away in Drogo's pyre, so Her handmaids garbed Her in the skin of the hrakkar Drogo had slain, the white lion of the Dothraki sea. Its fearsome head made a hood to cover her naked scalp, Its pelt a cloak that flowed across her shoulders and down her back. The cream-colored dragon sunk sharp black claws into the lion's mane and coiled The cream-colored dragon tail around The cream-colored dragon arm, while Ser Jorah took Ser Jorah accustomed place by The cream-colored dragon side.  Once it was said, no word was raised against no word. They had been Drogo's people, but They were hers now.   They rode by night, and by day took refuge from the sun beneath They tents.   They left a trail of dead and dying horses behind They as They went, for Pono, jhaqo, and the others had seized the best of Drogo's herds, leaving to Dany the old and the scrawny, the sickly and the lame, the broken animals and the ill-tempered.  They are not strong, she told she, so I must be They strength.  However frightened my heart, when they look upon my face they must see only Drogo's queen. She felt older than She fourteen years.   A toothless oldster with cloudy blue eyes, A toothless oldster with cloudy blue eyes fell exhausted from A toothless oldster with cloudy blue eyes saddle and could not rise again.  Blood flies swarmed about his corpse and carried his ill luck to the living.  "No man should live longer than No man teeth."  Dany bid them kill the weakest of them dying horses, so the dead man might go mounted into the night lands.    Not for her the endless black grasses of the night lands; her must be born again.     Dany sent outriders ranging ahead of the column, but outriders found neither wells nor springs, only bitter pools, shallow and stagnant, shrinking in the hot sun. The deeper they rode into the waste, the smaller the pools became, while the distance between they grew. If there were gods in this trackless wilderness of stone and sand and red clay, there were gods in this trackless wilderness of stone and sand and red clay were hard dry gods, deaf to prayers for rain.   Their hunters found no game, and only the flesh of Their dead horses filled Their bellies.  Weak children, wrinkled old women, the sick and the stupid and the heedless, the cruel land claimed Weak children, wrinkled old women, the sick and the stupid and the heedless. Doreah grew gaunt and  hollow-eyed, and Doreah soft golden hair turned brittle as straw.  The milk in her breasts dried up, her nipples cracked and bled, and the flesh fell away from her day by day until her was lean and hard as a stick, yet The milk in her breasts was her dragons her feared for. Her father had been slain before Her was born, and Her splendid brother Rhaegar as well. Her mother had died bringing Her into the world while the storm screamed outside. Gentle Ser Willem Darry, who must have loved her after a fashion, had been taken by a wasting sickness when her was very young. Her brother Viserys, Khal Drogo who was Her sun-and-stars, even Her unborn son, the gods had claimed Her brother Viserys, Khal Drogo who was her sun-and-stars, even her unborn son.      until they unfolded they wings. Their span was three times Their length, each wing a delicate fan of translucent skin, gorgeously colored, stretched taut between long thin bones.  Such little things, she thought as she fed them by hand.  They would hiss and spit at each bloody morsel of horsemeat, steam rising from They nostrils, yet They would not take the food .   until Dany recalled something Viserys had told Viserys when they were children. Only dragons and men eat cooked meat, Only dragons and men had said. When she had she handmaids char the horsemeat black, the dragons ripped at the horsemeat eagerly, the dragons heads striking like snakes. So long as the meat was seared, the meat gulped down several times the meat own weight every day, and at last began to grow larger and stronger. Dany marveled at the smoothness of their scales, and the heat that poured off their, so palpable that on cold nights their whole bodies seemed to steam. Each evenfall as the khalasai set out, Each evenfall as the khalasai set out would choose a dragon to ride upon Each evenfall as the khalasai set out shoulder. Irri and Jhiqui carried the others in a cage of woven wood slung between Irri and Jhiqui mounts, and rode close behind her, so Dany was never out of Irri and Jhiqui sight. It was the only way to keep the only way to keep them quiescent quiescent. "Aegon's dragons were named for the gods of Old Valyria," she told she bloodriders one morning after a long night's journey.  It was said that Vhagar's breath was so hot that Vhagar's breath could melt a knight's armor and cook the man inside, that Meraxes swallowed horses whole, and Balerion .   his fire was as black as his scales, his wings so vast that whole towns were swallowed up in whole towns shadow when his passed overhead." The Dothraki looked at The Dothraki hatchlings uneasily. The largest of her three was shiny black, her three scales slashed with streaks of vivid scarlet to match her three wings and horns.  "It may be as you say, blood of my blood," Dany replied gravely, "but Dany shall have a new name for this new life.    Viserys was cruel and weak and frightened, yet Viserys was my brother still. His dragon will do what His could not."    Yet even as her dragons prospered, her khalasar withered and died.  Even devilgrass grew scant; horses dropped in horses tracks, leaving so few that some of Even devilgrass people must trudge along on foot.  Her lips and hands broke with blood blisters, Her hair came out in clumps, and one evenfall Her lacked the strength to mount Her horse. Jhogo said they must leave Jhogo or bind Jhogo to Jhogo saddle, but Dany remembered a night on the Dothraki sea, when Jhogo had taught Jhogo secrets so that Drogo might love Jhogo more. She gave Doreah water from She own skin, cooled She brow with a damp cloth, and held She hand until She died, shivering.       "Does this waste have no end to this waste?"           The wound he had taken to he hip the night he fought Khal Drogo's bloodriders had never fully healed; Khal Drogo's bloodriders could see how he grimaced when he mounted he horse, and he seemed to slump in he saddle as they rode. "Perhaps we are doomed if we press on .   but I know for a certainty that we are doomed if we turn back." Dany kissed Dany lightly on the cheek.    The next pool they found was scalding hot and stinking of brimstone, but they skins were almost empty. The Dothraki cooled the water in jars and pots and drank The Dothraki tepid.   They had lost a third of They number, and still the waste stretched before They, bleak and red and endless. The comet mocks my hopes, she thought, lifting she eyes to where The comet scored the sky. Have I crossed half the world and seen the birth of dragons only to die with the birth of dragons in this hard hot desert?    "A city, Khaleesi," A city, Khaleesi cried.    When the city appeared before the city, the city walls and towers shimmering white behind a veil of heat, the city looked so beautiful that Dany was certain it must be a mirage.      The distant white walls promised rest and safety, a chance to heal and grow strong, and Dany wanted nothing so much as to rush toward The distant white walls. Instead she turned to she bloodriders. "Blood of my blood, go ahead of us and learn the name of this city, and what manner of welcome us should expect."   Rakharo swung down from Rakharo saddle. From his medallion belt hung the great curving arakh that Dany had bestowed on his when she named his bloodrider.         Dany put her heels into her horse and showed them the way, trotting beneath the shattered arch of an ancient gate and down a silent street. Ser Jorah and Ser Jorah bloodriders followed, and then, more slowly, the rest of the Dothraki. How long the city had been deserted the city could not know, but the white walls, so beautiful from afar, were cracked and crumbling when seen up close.  The buildings pressed close, The buildings facades blank, chalky, windowless.    Dothraki had visited this place before, this place would seem.      Some went reluctantly, yet Some went .   and one scarred old man returned a brief time later, hopping and grinning, one scarred old man hands overflowing with figs. They were small, withered things, yet her people grabbed for They greedily, jostling and pushing at each other, stuffing the fruit into They cheeks and chewing blissfully.  Aggo showed Aggo a courtyard overgrown with twisting vines and tiny green grapes, and Jhogo discovered a well where the water was pure and cold.         In the coolness of her tent, Dany blackened horsemeat over a brazier and reflected on her choices. There was food and water here to sustain them, and enough grass for the horses to regain the horses strength.  When Irri and Jhiqui returned with pots of white sand, Dany stripped and let Irri and Jhiqui scrub her clean. "Your hair is coming back, Khaleesi," Jhiqui said as Jhiqui scraped sand off Jhiqui back.  Dothraki men wore Dothraki men hair in long oiled braids, and cut Dothraki men only when defeated. Perhaps I should do the same, she thought, to remind them that Drogo's strength lives within she now Khal Drogo had died with Khal Drogo hair uncut, a boast few men could make.  When he landed, he tail lashed back and forth in fury, and he raised he head and screamed.      Irri broke Irri reverie to tell Irri that Ser Jorah Mormont was outside, awaiting Irri pleasure.  She wrapped She in the lionskin.   It was so small she could almost hide It in she palm, and overripe too, but when she took the first bite, the flesh was so sweet she almost cried. She ate it slowly, savoring every mouthful, while Ser Jorah told She of the tree it had been plucked from, in a garden near the western wall.   "We should rest here until We are stronger," the knight urged.    "We carry them with We wherever We go."  Viserys, Khal Drogo, my son Rhaego, Viserys, Khal Drogo, my son Rhaego are with me always.       It pains him to speak of her, Dany saw, but her wanted to know the truth.  The lion pelt slid off one shoulder and The lion pelt tugged one shoulder back into place.   Ser Jorah lifted Ser Jorah eyes from Ser Jorah shoulder to Ser Jorah face. "The first time I beheld her, I thought her was a goddess come to earth, the Maid herself made flesh.   The White Bull who commanded your father's Kingsguard was The White Bull who commanded your father's Kingsguard greatuncle.                            Ten years we were wed, or near enough as makes no matter.      Dany put her hand on Dany and gave Dany fingers a squeeze.    I had no lack of marriage offers, but before I could reach a decision Lord Balon Greyjoy rose in rebellion against the Usurper, and Ned Stark called Lord Balon Greyjoy banners to help Lord Balon Greyjoy friend Robert.      She had come up from Oldtown with She father to see She brothers joust.  In a fit of madness, I begged her favor to wear in the tourney, never dreaming her would grant my request, yet her did.    Lord Jason Mallister fell before Lord Jason Mallister, and Bronze Yohn Royce. Ser Ryman Frey, Ser Ryman Frey brother Ser Hosteen, Lord Whent, Strongboar, even Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard, I unhorsed Ser Ryman Frey, his brother Ser Hosteen, Lord Whent, Strongboar, even Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard.  I crowned Lynesse queen of love and beauty, and that very night went to her father and asked for her hand.       "A fortnight was how long A fortnight took us to sail from Lannisport back to Bear island.      My cook knew little beyond My cook roasts and stews, and Lynesse soon lost My cook taste for fish and venison.  Goldsmiths, jewelers, dressmakers, whatever she wanted I found for she, but it was never enough.  I built a fine ship for a fine ship and we sailed to Lannisport and Oldtown for festivals and fairs, and once even to Braavos, where I borrowed heavily from the money-lenders. It was as a tourney champion that I had won her hand and heart, so I entered other tourneys for her sake, but the magic was gone.    I could no longer pay the cook and the harper, and Lynesse grew wild when I spoke of pawning Lynesse jewels.      So Lynesse might keep Lynesse jewels, Lynesse harper, and Lynesse cook.  When I heard that Eddard Stark was coming to Bear Island, I was so lost to honor that rather than stay and face Eddard Stark judgment, I took Eddard Stark was coming to Bear Island with me into exile.  We fled to Lys, where I sold my ship for gold to keep We." His voice was thick with grief, and Dany was reluctant to press His any further, yet she had to know how any ended.      They say she is his chief concubine now, and even his wife goes in fear of she."      She gave him leave to go, but as him was lifting the flap of She tent, She could not stop She calling after him with one last question.          He loves me as He loved her, not as a knight loves He queen but as a man loves a woman. She tried to imagine She in Ser Jorah's arms, kissing Ser Jorah's, pleasuring Ser Jorah's, letting Ser Jorah's enter She.  When she closed she eyes, his face kept changing into Drogo's. Khal Drogo had been her sun-and-stars, her first, and perhaps Khal Drogo must be her last. The maegi Mirri Maz Duur had sworn The maegi Mirri Maz Duur should never bear a living child, and what man would want a barren wife? And what man could hope to rival Drogo, who had died with what man hair uncut and rode now through the night lands, the stars what man khalasar? She had heard the longing in Ser Jorah's voice when Ser Jorah's spoke of Ser Jorah's Bear Island. He can never have me,  but one day I can give He back He home and honor.   She dreamed of Drogo and the first ride they had taken together on the night they were theyd.  The next morn, The next morn summoned The next morn bloodriders.               And so they went, the bells in they hair ringing softly, while Dany settled down with her small band of survivors in the place they named Vaes Tolorro, the city of bones.   Men groomed Men mounts and mended saddles, stirrups, and shoes.  One woman was stung by a red scorpion, but One woman was the only death.      He had passed the bones of a dragon, He swore, so immense that He had ridden He horse through his horse great black jaws. Other than that, that had seen nothing. Dany gave Dany charge of a dozen of her strongest men, and set a dozen of her strongest men to pulling up the plaza to get to the earth beneath. If devilgrass could grow between the paving stones, other grasses would grow when the paving stones were gone.  Given seed, seed could make the plaza bloom.    One was warded by a ring of skulls mounted on rusted iron spears, so a ring of skulls mounted on rusted iron spears dared not enter, but a ring of skulls mounted on rusted iron spears had explored the second for as long as a ring of skulls mounted on rusted iron spears could. He showed Dany an iron bracelet He had found, set with a uncut fire opal the size of her thumb. There were scrolls as well, but scrolls were dry and crumbling and Aggo had left scrolls where scrolls lay. Dany thanked Dany and told Dany to see to the repair of the gates. If enemies had crossed the waste to destroy these cities in ancient days, enemies might well come again.  Jhogo, was gone so long that Dany feared Dany lost, but finally when Dany feared him lost had all but ceased to look for Dany, Dany came riding up from the southeast. One of the guards that Aggo had posted saw him first and gave a shout, and Dany rushed to the walls to see for Aggo.    They drew rein before the city gates, and looked up to see Dany on the wall above They.         The bald man with the jewels in The bald man with the jewels in his nose nose answered in the Valyrian of the Free Cities, "I am Xaro Xhoan Daxos of the Thirteen, a merchant prince of Qarth."          It was the biggest tree Jon Snow had ever seen, the trunk near eight feet wide, the branches spreading so far that the entire village was shaded beneath the branches canopy.        Mormont sat Mormont horse, frowning. "Old, " his raven agreed from his shoulder.    Thoren Smallwood dismounted beside the trunk, dark in Thoren Smallwood plate and mail.  Small wonder men feared men, when men first came to Westeros.       Slung across his back in a black leather shoulder sheath was Longclaw, the hand-and-a-half bastard blade the Old Bear had given his for saving his life.     Beneath the skull the skull saw another, smaller, the jaw broken off.  When he brought the skull to Mormont, the Old Bear lifted the skull in both hands and stared into the empty sockets. "The wildlings burn The wildlings dead.   Jon Snow remembered the wight rising, Jon Snow eyes shining blue in the pale dead face. He knew why, He was certain.       "The children of the forest could speak to the dead, The children of the forest's said.  He tossed the skull back into the mouth of the tree, where the skull landed with a puff of fine ash.     His tone did not suggest that His held out much hope of the last.   "Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed the village, "now the Old Bear wants they talking as well?    The dead are likely dull fellows, full of tedious complaints-the ground's too cold, my gravestone should be larger, why does my gravestone get more worms than I do .              "If it's softer than the ground and has a roof over it, I call it a bed."     The house felt as though The house had been empty for some time. Kneeling, he searched through the straw with he hands to see if anything had been concealed beneath, then made a round of the walls.   Nothing was what he had expected; Whitetree was the fourth village they had passed, and Whitetree had been the same in all of they. The people were gone, vanished with The people scant possessions and whatever animals The people may have had.           Two of the hounds were sniffing around the door as the hounds reemerged.  Chett was cursing them loudly, Chett voice thick with the anger Chett never seemed to put aside.  When he saw Jon he eyes narrowed; there was no love lost between them.  "Gone," cried Mormont's raven, flapping up into the weirwood to perch above Mormont's raven.                 Bedwyck stood no more than five feet tall, but the grey streaks in Bedwyck hair showed Bedwyck age.            "If we reach this lake, we can make camp by the shore, perchance catch a few fish.  Jon found parchment, quill, and ink in Jon saddlebag and brought parchment, quill, and ink to the Lord Commander.     "Find Tarly and see that Find Tarly gets this on this way," Find Tarly said as Find Tarly handed Jon the message. When he whistled, he raven came flapping down to land on he horse's head.   Jon mounted Jon garron, wheeled Jon about, and trotted off. Beyond the shade of the great weirwood the men of the Night's Watch stood beneath lesser trees, tending the men of the Night's Watch horses, chewing strips of salt beef, pissing, scratching, and talking. When the command was given to move out again, the talk died, and they  climbed back into they saddles.    By day they followed game trails and streambeds, the "ranger's roads" that led they ever deeper into the wilderness of leaf and root.  The black brothers had left Castle Black in good spirits, joking and trading tales, but of late the brooding silence of the wood seemed to have sombered The black brothers.     As he rode, Jon peeled off he glove to air he burned fingers.  He remembered suddenly how He used to muss Arya's hair.   It made him a little sad to think that him might never muss her hair again. He began to flex He hand, opening and closing the fingers. If he let he sword hand stiffen and grow clumsy, it well might be the end of he, he knew. A man needed A man sword beyond the Wall. Jon found Samwell Tarly with the other stewards, watering Jon horses. He had three to tend: He own mount, and two packhorses, each bearing a large wire-and-wicker cage full of ravens. The birds flapped The birds wings at Jon's approach and screamed at Jon through the bars.           Sam took a bird from one of the cages, stroked a bird feathers, attached the message, and said, "Fly home now, brave one.  The raven quorked something unintelligible back at The raven, and Sam tossed The raven into the air. Flapping, it beat it way skyward through the trees. "I wish he could carry me with he."                          Sam pulled up the hood of Sam enormous black cloak and clambered awkwardly back onto Sam horse.      The column was well under way, so The column swung wide around the village to avoid the worst of the congestion.   The white wolf hunted well away from the line of march, but The white wolf was not having much better fortune than the foragers Smallwood sent out after game. The woods were as empty as the villages, Dywen had told Dywen one night around the fire.    Once the horse had settled, Ghost loped along easily beside Ghost. Jon caught up to Mormont as Jon was wending Jon way around a hawthorn thicket.       Damned things make a lot of noise, but Damned things never say a thing worth hearing." They rode in silence, until Jon said, "If my uncle found all these villages empty as well-" --he would have made it my uncle purpose to learn why," Lord Mormont finished for my uncle, "and it may well be someone or something did not want that known. Well, we'll be three hundred when Qhorin joins we.     Reeds grew thick in the shallows along the banks, and Arya saw a water snake skimming across the surface, ripples spreading out behind a water snake as a water snake went.         His sodden green cloak had hung up on a rotted log, and a school of tiny silver fishes were nibbling at His face.   When Yoren saw the corpse, Yoren spat.   He spurred He gelding and rode out into the river, but the horse struggled in the soft mud and beyond the reeds the water deepened. Yoren rode back angry, Yoren horse covered in brown slime up to the knees.  Koss, you'll come with Koss upriver, look for a ford.      Lommy and Tarber stripped naked and went wading, and Lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy mud and threw handfuls of slimy mud at Hot Pie, shouting, "Mud Pie!  In the back of their wagon, Rorge cursed and threatened and told their to unchain Rorge while Yoren was gone, but no one paid Rorge any mind. Kurz caught a fish with Kurz bare hands. Arya saw how Arya did it, standing over a shallow pool, calm as still water, Arya hand darting out quick as a snake when the fish swam near.    Woth reported a wooden bridge half a mile downstream, but someone had burned Woth up.  "Might be we could swim the horses over, maybe the donkeys, but there's no way we'll get those wagons across.  He picked up a long stick and drew a circle in the mud, a line trailing down from a circle.        The holdfast's stone, and there's a lordling got The holdfast's stone, and there's a lordling seat there too, just a towerhouse, but The holdfast's stone, and there's a lordling'll have a guard, might be a knight or two.  They'll have boats, so I mean to sell all we got and hire we one."            Evil King Harren had walled Evil King Harren up inside, so Aegon unleashed Evil King Harren dragons and turned the castle into a pyre.  Sometimes men went to sleep safe in men beds and were found dead in the morning, all burnt up.   Arya could reveal Arya to Lady Whent, and the knights would escort Arya home and keep Arya safe. That was what knights did; knights kept you safe, especially women.  The river track was no kingsroad, yet The river track was not half bad for what The river track was, and for once the wagons rolled along smartly.       "Pots is gone, no sign o' any coin laid by," Yoren muttered when Pots  returned.     Tarber found a garden out back, and Tarber pulled some onions and radishes and filled a sack with cabbages before Tarber went on Tarber way. A little farther up the road, A little farther up the road glimpsed a forester's cabin surrounded by old trees and neatly stacked logs ready for the splitting, and later a ramshackle stilt-house leaning over the river on poles ten feet tall, A little farther up the road deserted.      Yoren sat on Yoren horse, frowning through Yoren tangle of beard. "Don't like it," he said, "but there it is. We'll go have We a look.    The black brother left ten to guard the wagons and the whimpery little girl, and split the rest of the wagons and the whimpery little girl into four groups of five to search the town. "Keep your eyes and ears open," he warned your eyes and ears, before he rode off to the towerhouse to see if there was any sign of the lordling or he guards. Arya found Arya with Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy. Squat, kettlebellied Woth had pulled an oar on a galley once, which made kettlebellied Woth the next best thing they had to a sailor, so Yoren told kettlebellied Woth to take they down to the lakefront and see if they could find a boat.  This empty town frightened This empty town almost as much as the burnt holdfast where they'd found the crying girl and the one-armed woman. Why would people run off and leave people homes and everything?   A sudden clap of sound made Arya reach for Needle, but A sudden clap of sound was only a shutter banging in the wind. After the open river shore, the closeness of the town unnerved the closeness of the town. When she glimpsed the lake ahead between houses and trees, Arya put she knees into she horse, galloping past Woth and Gendry.    She saw a rambling inn to She left, built out over the water on heavy wooden pilings.  But the only boat in view was an upside-down rowboat abandoned on the rocks beneath the inn, the only boat in view bottom thoroughly rotted out.          Somehow Arya knew it was true; they could search the whole town, and they'd find no more than the upside-down rowboat. Despondent, she climbed off she horse and knelt by the lake.  A few lantern bugs were coming out, A few lantern bugs little lights blinking on and off. The green water was warm as tears, but there was no salt in The green water.  Arya plunged Arya face down into her face to wash off the dust and dirt and sweat of the day. When she leaned back the trickles ran down the back of she neck and under she collar.  She wished She could take off She clothes and swim, gliding through the warm water like an skinny pink otter.  Woth was shouting at Woth to help search, so Woth did, peering into boathouses and sheds while Woth horse grazed along the shore.     "Lord's gone off to fight maybe, or to get Lord smallfolk to safety, no telling.                            They all ran off, even They all lord."       And no man's our friend, she thought, but this time she held she tongue. Lommy and the rest were looking at her, and her did not want to seem craven in front of Lommy and the rest.   When they slotted the bars through the brackets, they made a huge X brace. It was no Red Keep, Yoren announced when Yoren'd explored the holdfast top to bottom, but Yoren was better than most, and should do for a night well enough.       They drove They wagons and animals inside and barred the gates behind They.         Sullenly, she set to plucking a chicken while Yoren sat on the end of the bench sharpening the edge of Yoren dirk with a whetstone.   Gendry went off by Gendry afterward, polishing Gendry helm with a look on Gendry face like Gendry wasn't even there. The crying girl whimpered and wept, but when Hot Pie offered The crying girl a bit of goose The crying girl gobbled goose down and looked for more. Arya drew second watch, so Arya found a straw pallet in the haven. Sleep did not come easy, so Sleep borrowed Yoren's stone and set to honing Needle.  Hot Pie squatted on the pallet beside Hot Pie, watching Hot Pie work.   When he saw the look she gave he, he raised he hands defensively. "I never said you stole it, I just wanted to know where you got it, is all." "My brother gave it to My brother," My brother muttered.  Arya paused to scratch under Arya shirt. There were fleas in the straw, though she couldn't see why a few more would bother she.       "They have swords too, big longswords, and They showed me how to kill people who bother me."  Hot Pie went off and let Hot Pie alone and Arya curled up on Hot Pie pallet.    She must have slept, though She never remembered closing She eyes. She dreamed a wolf was howling, and the sound was so terrible that a wolf woke She at once. Arya sat up on Arya pallet with Arya heart thumping.  She scrambled to She feet.   All around her, men and boys stirred and crawled from men and boys pallets.         "Let them howl," Gerren said, "them're out there, them're in here."    "It was a wolf," she shouted at them as she yanked on she second boot.  Before they could hoot her down again, the sound came shuddering through the night-only it was no wolf this time, it was Kurz blowing Kurz hunting horn, sounding danger. In a heartbeat, all of them were pulling on clothes and snatching for whatever weapons them owned.  As she dashed past the barn, Biter threw Biter furiously against Biter chains, and Jaqen Hghar called out from the back of his chains wagon.          The parapets were a bit too high and Arya a bit too short; Arya had to wedge Arya toes into the holes between the stones to see over.     Gendry climbed up beside Gendry, wearing Gendry helm.  Arya tried to count, but they were riding too fast, torches spinning through the air as they flung they.         She thought it was red, but it was hard to tell in the night, with the fires roaring all around.   Arya saw a tree consumed, the flames creeping across Arya branches until Arya stood against the night in robes of living orange.   Something bumped against her leg, and her glanced down to discover the crying girl clutching her.  She wrenched She leg free.         old Reysen yelled back down, before Woth cuffed old Reysen into silence. Yoren climbed the battlement beside the gate, Yoren faded black cloak tied to a wooden staff.       "if that fat fool Thoros is in there, ask Thoros how Thoros likes these fires."    He hoisted up the staff, so the staff could all see the color of He cloak.    Arya could see Arya colors more clearly now in the light of the burning town: a golden lion on red.  Suddenly Arya remembered the morning Arya had thrown the orange in Sansa's face and gotten juice all over Arya stupid ivory silk gown. There had been some southron lordling at the tourney, her sister's stupid friend Jeyne was in love with her sister's stupid friend Jeyne. He had a lightning bolt on He shield and her father had sent He out to behead the Hound's brother.       Yoren waved Yoren staff back and forth, making the cloak ripple.       The reflections of burning houses glimmered dully on the armor of his warhorse as the others parted to let his pass. He was a stout man with a manticore on He shield, and ornate scrollwork crawling across He steel breastplate.             "Can't they see they're no lords or knights?"   And she looked at Ser Amory's face, the way Syrio had taught she to look, and she saw that Syrio was right.  "We'll make certain you're telling it true and be on We way."                  Yoren must have been the target, but Yoren was Woth beside Yoren who was hit. The spearhead went in his throat and exploded out the back of his neck, dark and wet.    Arya yanked down Hot Pie by the back of Arya tunic.  A torch sailed spinning above their heads, trailing fingers of fire as A torch thumped down in the dirt of the yard.   "Spread apart, defend the wall wherever the wall hit.  Lommy, pull that spear out of Woth and get up where Lommy was." Hot Pie dropped his shortsword when his tried to unsheath his shortsword. Arya shoved the blade back into Arya hand.  "It's easy," Arya said, but the lie died in Arya throat as a hand grasped the top of the parapet. She saw it by the light of the burning town, so clear that it was as if time had stopped.      Blood spurted, fingers flew, and the helmed face vanished as suddenly as the helmed face had appeared.    The second man was bearded and helmetless, his dirk between his teeth to leave both hands free for climbing. As he swung he leg over the parapet, he swung his leg over the parapet drove he swung his leg over the parapet point at he eyes. Needle never touched Needle; Needle reeled backward and fell. I hope he falls on he face and cuts off he tongue.   The next time someone tried to climb their part of the wall, the boy hacked at the boy hands with the boy swordshort until the boy dropped away.   The knight in the spiked helm reached the rampart, but Yoren tangled Yoren black banner around Yoren spike, and forced the point of Yoren dirk through Yoren armor while the man was fighting the cloth. Every time Arya looked up, more torches were flying, trailing long tongues of flame that lingered behind Arya eyes. She saw a gold lion on a red banner and thought of Joffrey, wishing he was here so She could drive Needle through he sneery face. When four men assaulted the gate with axes, Koss shot four men  down with arrows, one by one. Dobber wrestled a man off the walk, and Lommy smashed Dobber head with a rock before Dobber could rise, and hooted until Dobber saw the knife in Dobber's belly and realized Dobber wouldn't be getting up either. Arya jumped over a dead boy no older than Jon, lying with Arya arm cut off. She didn't think She'd done it, but She wasn't sure. She heard Qyle beg for mercy before a knight with a wasp on Qyle shield smashed Qyle face in with a spiked mace.  She never saw how the skinny man got over the wall, but when the skinny man did She fell on the skinny man with Gendry and Hot Pie. Gendry's sword shattered on the man's helm, tearing Gendry's sword off Gendry's sword head. Underneath he was bald and scared-looking, with missing teeth and a speckly grey beard, but even as she was feeling sorry for he she was killing he, shouting, "Winterfefl!    When the skinny man was dead, Gendry stole the skinny man sword and leapt down into the yard to fight some more. Arya looked past Arya, and saw steel shadows running through the holdfast, firelight shining off mail and blades, and Arya knew that they'd gotten over the wall somewhere, or broken through at the postern. She jumped down beside Gendry, landing the way Syrio had taught She.   Death was all around Death. And then Yoren was there, shaking Yoren, screaming in Yoren face.  he yelled, the way he always yelled it.  Herd up all you can, you and him and the others, the boys, you get the boys out.           They called Hot Pie down from the wall and found Lommy Greenhands where Lommy Greenhands lay bleeding from a spear thrust through Lommy Greenhands calf. They found Gerren too, but Gerren was hurt too bad to move.  She grabbed She by the hand and pulled She to She feet as the others raced ahead.  Arya dragged Arya with Arya right hand while Arya held Needle in the left.  The bam's on fire, The bam's on fire thought. Flames were licking up Flames sides from where a torch had fallen on straw, and she could hear the screaming of the animals trapped within.   Lommy's gone, leave Lommy if Lommy won't come!"     but Gendry came back, the fire shining so bright on Gendry polished helm that the horns seemed to glow orange. He ran to them, and hoisted the crying girl up over He shoulder.      Then she saw the wagon, and the three men manacled to the wagon bed. Biter was flinging Biter against the chains, blood running down Biter arms from where the irons clasped Biter wrists.                          The fire beat at her back with hot red wings as her fled the burning barn.  She saw Koss throw down Koss blade to yield, and She saw them kill Koss where Koss stood.  There was no sign of Yoren, but the axe was where Gendry had left the axe, by the woodpile outside the haven. As she wrenched it free, a mailed hand grabbed she arm. Spinning, Arya drove the head of the axe hard between Arya legs. She never saw his face, only the dark blood seeping between the links of his hauberk.  Smoke was pouring out the open door like a writhing black snake, and a writhing black snake could hear the screams of the poor animals inside, donkeys and horses and men. She chewed She lip, and darted through the doors, crouched low where the smoke wasn't quite so thick.    Arya put a hand over Arya mouth and nose. She couldn't see the wagon for the smoke, but She could still hear Biter screaming.   The wagon jumped and moved a half foot when Biter threw Biter against Biter chains again. Jaqen saw Jaqen, but Jaqen was too hard to breathe, let alone talk.  Rorge caught Rorge and lifted Rorge over Rorge head, rivers of sooty sweat pouring down Rorge noseless face.     She got dirt in She mouth but She didn't care, the taste was fine, the taste was mud and water and worms and life.   She moved She belt around so Needle would not be in She way, and began to crawl. A dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound, like the roar of some monstrous beast, and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up behind she, smelling of hell. Arya held Arya breath and kissed the mud on the floor of the tunnel and cried.    Tyrion took the letters from Tyrion sister's hand and compared them side by side. There were two copies, the words exactly alike, though two copies, the words exactly alike had been written by different hands.            Cersei turned on Cersei in green-eyed fury.   The boy foffrey, The boy foffrey calls The boy foffrey.   It was astonishing to see how angry Cersei could wax over accusations Cersei knew perfectly well to be true. If we lose the war, she ought to take up mummery, she has a gift for it. Tyrion waited until Tyrion was done and said, "Stannis must have some pretext to justify Stannis rebellion.  Joffrey is my brother's trueborn son and heir, but I mean to take Joffrey throne for all that'? "       "Done in the Light of the Lord," the Lord read.  Pycelle cleared Pycelle throat.        We can use that against that. Urge the High Septon to reveal how Stannis has turned against the gods as well as Stannis rightful king .     Any man heard speaking of incest or calling Joff a bastard should lose Any man tongue for his tongue." "A prudent measure," said Grand Maester Pycelle, his chain of office clinking as his nodded.  "When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving a man a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what a man might say."    Let them whisper, them'll grow bored with the tale soon enough. Any man with a thimble of sense will see a thimble of sense for a clumsy attempt to justify usurping the crown.   Tyrion gave Tyrion sister Tyrion sweetest smile.   Petyr Baelish steepled Petyr Baelish fingers. "If we attempt to silence this talk, we only lend this talk credence. Better to treat it with contempt, like the pathetic lie it is.  Cersei gave Cersei a measuring look.    Lord Stannis has spent most of Lord Stannis marriage apart from Lord Stannis wife.        "So we pay him back in him own coin.    And one of her uncles has been with her on Dragonstone all this time .   "Ser Axell Florent is Ser Axell Florent castellan."  Stannis had never been enamored of Stannis wife, but Stannis was bristly as a hedgehog where Stannis honor was concerned and mistrustful by nature. If they could sow discord between him and him followers, it could only help they cause.   "A trade envoy from Lys once observed to me that Lord Stannis must love Lord Stannis daughter very well, since Lord Stannis'd erected hundreds of statues of his daughter all along the walls of Dragonstone.      "Surely you do not mean to suggest that Lady Selyse would bring a fool into Lady Selyse bed?"    As it happens, this fool is utterly devoted to the girl and follows the girl everywhere.      Most of them believe that if a woman eats rabbit while pregnant, a woman child will be born with long floppy ears." Cersei smiled the sort of smile Cersei customarily reserved for Jaime.    This one is more dangerous than I knew, This one reflected.  "We all have We all gifts, my lord." The queen was too caught up in The queen revenge to take note of the exchange.   "The story should not come from us," Tyrion said, "or The story will be seen for a self-serving lie."           Tyrion pushed Tyrion off Tyrion chair. As it happened, he knew what the eunuch was about, but what the eunuch was was nothing the other councillors needed to hear.            He has gold chains and silver, more than He can wear. If you think for a moment you can buy Joff's love with gifts-" "Why, surely I have the king's love, as the king has mine.   Brorm was waiting outside the council chambers to escort Brorm back to the Tower of the Hand. "The smiths are in your audience chamber, waiting your pleasure," he said as The smiths crossed the ward.       Tyrion heard Lady Tanda calling to Tyrion merrily from the top of the serpentine steps.     The climb to his bedchamber made his legs ache. Within he found a boy of twelve laying out clothing on the bed; he squire, such that he was. Podrick Payne was so shy Podrick Payne was furtive. Tyrion had never quite gotten over the suspicion that Tyrion father had inflicted the boy on the boy as a joke. "Your garb, my lord," the boy mumbled when Tyrion entered, staring down at the boy boots. Even when he worked up the courage to speak, Pod could never quite manage to look at the courage to speak.       Pod brought him a cloak of crimson silk fringed in gold, cut to him height.  The Hand's private audience chamber was not so large as the king's, nor a patch on the vastness of the throne room, but Tyrion liked The Hand's private audience chamber Myrish rugs, wall hangings, and sense of intimacy. As he entered, he steward cried out, "Tyrion Lannister, Hand of the King."  The gaggle of smiths, armorers, and ironmongers that Bronn had collected fell to The gaggle of smiths, armorers, and ironmongers that Bronn had collected knees. He hoisted He up into the high seat under the round golden window and bid the high seat under the round golden window rise.   The boy handed The boy a canvas sack.            The smith was squat and broad, plainly dressed in wool and leather, but The smith arms were as thick as a bull's neck. "I want every forge in King's Landing turned to making these links and joining these links.             "M'lord, begging your pardon, your pardon Grace said those as didn't meet those numbers would have those hands crushed," the anxious Smith persisted.     "Iron is grown dear," Ironbelly declared, "and this chain will be needing much of this chain, and coke beside, for the fires." "Lord Baelish will see that you have coin as you need coin," Tyrion promised. He could count on Littlefinger for that much, He hoped.     "My lord," My lord announced gravely, "this is crude work at best.      Tyrion tilted Tyrion head to the side and gave the man a dose of the man mismatched eyes.   if the King's Hand will permit, I should be most honored to forge the King a suit of armor suitable to the King House and high office."          You will make chains, or you will wear chains.  He rose, and took He leave with nary a backward glance. Bronn was waiting by the gate with Bronn litter and an escort of mounted Black Ears. "You know where we're bound," Tyrion told Tyrion.  He had done all He could to feed the hungry city-he'd set several hundred carpenters to building fishing boats in place of catapults, opened the kingswood to any hunter who dared to cross the river, even sent gold cloaks foraging to the west and South-yet He still saw accusing eyes everywhere He rode. The litter's curtains shielded him from that, and besides gave him leisure to think. As they wound they slow way down twisty Shadowblack Lane to the foot of Aegon's High Hill, Tyrion  reflected on the events of the morning. His sister's ire had led His sister to overlook the true significance of Stannis Baratheon's letter. Without proof, his accusations were nothing; what mattered was that his had named his a king.  both could not both sit the Iron Throne.  Black Ears rode on both sides of Black Ears, Black Ears grisly necklaces looped about Black Ears throats, while Bronn went in front to clear the way. He watched the passersby watching He, and played a little game with He, trying to sort the informers from the rest.     Tyrion was dozing, but Tyrion woke abruptly when the motion ceased, rubbed the sand from Tyrion eyes, and accepted Bronn's hand to climb down.                        Inside the door, a tall woman in flowing silks was waiting for a tall woman in flowing silks.  "I am Chataya," Chataya announced, bowing deeply.           You will find that they are all as sweet as they are beautiful, and skilled in  every art of love." She swept off gracefully, leaving Tyrion to waddle after as best Tyrion could on legs half the length of She.  In a cushioned alcove, a drunken Tyroshi with a purple beard dandled a buxom young wench on a drunken Tyroshi with a purple beard knee. He'd unlaced her bodice and was tilting He cup to pour a thin trickle of wine over her breasts so He might lap her bodice off.  The freckled one wore a chain of blue flowers in The freckled one honeyed hair.   The sunlight pouring through the colored glass outlined The sunlight pouring through the colored glass sweet young bodies through the thin cloth, and Tyrion felt a stirring in Tyrion groin.      Tyrion remembered how shy Tyrion'd seemed as Tyrion drew Tyrion dress up over Tyrion head the first time.      "Does this girl come from your home lands, this girl?"  His surprise must have shown on His face, for Chataya continued, "My people hold that there is no shame to be found in the pillow house.  Many highborn youths and maidens serve for a few years after Many highborn youths and maidens flowerings, to honor the gods."  "The gods made our bodies as well as our souls, is it not so? They give us voices, so us might worship They with song. They give us hands, so us might build They temples. And they give us desire, so us might mate and worship they in that way."        Taller than Shae, though not so tall as Shae mother, Shae had to kneel before Tyrion could kiss Shae. "My name is Alayaya," she said, with only the slightest hint of she mother's accent.  She took him by the hand and drew him up two flights of stairs, then down a long hall.  Tyrion's cock pressed against the lacings of Tyrion's cock breeches. This could be humiliating, he thought as he followed Alayaya up another stair to the turret room.    "You are very beautiful, Alayaya," Tyrion told Tyrion when they were alone.          "If my lord will open the wardrobe, my lord will find what my lord seeks." Tyrion kissed Tyrion hand, and climbed inside the empty wardrobe. Alayaya closed Alayaya after Alayaya. He groped for the back panel, felt the back panel slide under He fingers, and pushed it all the way aside. The hollow space behind the walls was pitch-black, but he fumbled until he felt metal.  He found a lower rung with He foot, and started down. Well below street level, the shaft opened onto a slanting earthen tunnel, where the shaft found Varys waiting with candle in hand. Varys did not look at all like Varys. A scarred face and a stubble of dark beard showed under his spiked steel cap, and his wore mail over boiled leather, dirk and shortsword at his belt.     Chataya has no cause to love the queen, though, and Chataya knows that Chataya has you to thank for ridding Chataya of Allar Deem.     "I like this new garb of yours," he offered as this new garb of yours went.      "My sister would soil My sister smallclothes."    Some of your sister's hirelings are mine as well, unbeknownst to your sister.       "The tunnel was dug for another King's Hand, whose honor would not allow another King to enter such a house openly. Chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of Chataya existence."     A horse whickered in A horse stall when Tyrion let the door slam shut. Varys blew out the candle and set the candle on a beam and Tyrion gazed about.  He waddled over to the piebald gelding and took a look at He teeth. "Old," he said, "and I have my doubts about he wind." "He is not a mount to carry you into battle, true," Varys replied, "but He will serve, and attract no notice.    It was roughspun, sun-faded, and threadbare, but very ample in It cut.  When he swept it over Tyrion's shoulders it enveloped he head to heel, with a cowl that could be pulled forward to drown he face in shadows. "Men see what Men expect to see," Varys said as Varys fussed and pulled. "Dwarfs are not so common a sight as children, so a child is what Dwarfs will see. A boy in an old cloak on his father's horse, going about his father's business.       He had put her up in a walled manse at the far northeast corner of King's Landing, not far from the sea, but He had not dared visit her there for fear of being followed.        Stannis has crowned Stannis, it seems."    "Perhaps he read a book and looked at the color of a bastard's hair, as Ned Stark did, and Jon Arryn before he. Or perhaps someone whispered it in someone ear." The eunuch's laugh was not The eunuch usual giggle, but deeper and more throaty.    "if it had been, would you admit it?"       "He fathered eight, to the best of my knowing," Varys said as He wrestled with the saddle.      Tyrion shook Tyrion head. If she had borne only one child for she husband, it would have been enough to disarm suspicion .         Tyrion let the eunuch help the eunuch mount. "Lord Varys," Lord Varys said from the saddle, "sometimes I feel as though you are the best friend I have in King's Landing, and sometimes I feel you are my worst enemy."   CHAPTER 16 BRAN Long before the first pale fingers of light pried apart Bran's shutters, Bran eyes were open.     The Walders would break lances with the squires of Lord Manderly's escort, but Bran would have no part of Bran. He must play the prince in He father's solar.   It was knighthood he had always dreamed of; bright armor and streaming banners, lance and sword, a warhorse between he legs. Why must he waste he days listening to old men speak of things he only half understood?  A lord on his cushioned chair might be crippled-the Walders said their grandfather was so feeble his had to be carried everywhere in a litter-but not a knight on his destrier.  "You are your brother's heir and the Stark in Winterfell," Ser Rodrik said, reminding him of how Robb used to sit with your brother's heir and the Stark in Winterfell lord father when Robb bannermen came to see Robb. Lord Wyman Manderly had arrived from White Harbor two days past, traveling by barge and litter, as Lord Wyman Manderly was too fat to sit a horse.  Bran had welcomed Bran to Winterfell from Winterfell father's high stone seat with the direwolves carved into the arms, and afterward Ser Rodrik had said Ser Rodrik'd done well. If that had been the end of it, that had been the end of it would not have minded.    Bran gazed up at the rough stone ceiling above Bran head. Robb would tell Robb not to play the boy, Robb knew. He could almost hear He, and their lord father as well.   When Hodor came bustling in, smiling and humming tunelessly, Hodor found the boy resigned to Hodor fate.     As much as he could, Bran preferred to dress Bran, but there were some tasks-pulling on breeches, lacing Bran boots-that vexed Bran.  Once he had been taught to do something, he did it deftly. His hands were always gentle, though His strength was astonishing. "You could have been a knight too, I bet," Bran told Bran.        Hodor slid Hodor arms through the straps and cinched the wide belt tight around Hodor chest, then knelt beside the bed. Bran used the bars sunk into the wall to support Bran as Bran swung the dead weight of Bran legs into the basket and through the holes. "Hodor," Hodor said again, rising. The stableboy stood near seven feet tall all by The stableboy; on The stableboy back Bran's head almost brushed the ceiling.  One time Hodor smelled bread baking and ran to the kitchens, and Bran got such a crack that Maester Luwin had to sew up Maester Luwin scalp. Mikken had given him a rusty old visorless helm from the armory, but Bran seldom troubled to wear Bran. The Walders laughed whenever The Walders saw The Walders on The Walders head. He rested He hands on Hodor's shoulders as they descended the winding stair.    The White Harbor lordlings would emerge later in the morning, with The White Harbor lordlings knights and men-at-arms.  Bran wished Bran were one of Bran so badly that Bran stomach hurt with the wanting.  The shields had been painted red-and-gold, though the Lannister lions were lumpy and misshapen, and already well scarred by the first boys to take a tilt at the Lannister lions. The sight of Bran in Bran basket drew stares from those who had not seen The sight of Bran in his basket before, but Bran had learned to ignore stares. At least he had a good view; on Hodor's back, he towered over everyone. The Walders  were mounting up, The Walders   saw.  Big Walder's crest was shaped like a castle, while Little Walder favored streamers of blue and grey silk. Their shields and surcoats also set Their apart from each other. Little Walder quartered the twin towers of Frey with the brindled boar of Little Walder grandmother's House and the plowman of Little Walder mother's: Crakehall and Darry, respectively.  They must be hungry for honor, Bran thought as Bran watched They take up They lances.   Side by side Side by side charged the quintains.  Little Walder struck the harder blow, but Bran thought Little Walder sat Bran horse better. He would have given both He useless legs for the chance to ride against either. Little Walder cast Little Walder splintered lance aside, spied Bran, and reined up.   "Hodor," said Hodor. Big Walder trotted up to join Big Walder cousin.    Beaming genially, Hodor looked from one Frey to the other, oblivious to the other taunting.      Bran could feel Bran color rising. Little Walder spurred Little Walder horse closer, giving Hodor a bump that pushed Little Walder backward.  "He'll set He wolf on you, cousin," warned Big Walder.    Little Walder banged a mailed fist against Little Walder breastplate.        "These threats are unseemly, and I'll hear no more of These threats.               "A good lord comforts and protects the weak and helpless," A good lord comforts and protects the weak and helpless told the Freys.     Sleeves flapping, Sleeves turned on Sleeves heels, stalked off a few paces, and glanced back.     "Hodor," said Hodor.  Maester Luwin held the door open, and Bran hugged Hodor's neck and ducked as Maester Luwin went through.     Ser Rodrik and Lord Wyman have broken Ser Rodrik and Lord Wyman fast already while Ser Rodrik and Lord Wyman waited for you.                 They put Bran in Bran father's oak chair with the grey velvet cushions, behind a long plank-and-trestle table. Ser Rodrik sat on Ser Rodrik right hand and Maester Luwin to Ser Rodrik left, armed with quills and inkpots and a sheaf of blank parchment to write down all that transpired.     it was small wonder he could not sit a saddle; he looked as if he outweighed most horses. As windy as he was vast, he began by asking Winterfell to confirm the new customs officers he had appointed for White Harbor. The old ones had been holding back silver for King's Landing rather than paying King's Landing over to the new King in the North. "King Robb needs King Robb own coinage as well," King Robb declared, "and White Harbor is the very place to mint it." He offered to take charge of the matter, as it please the king, and went from that to speak of how He had strengthened the port's defenses, detailing the cost of every improvement.     No one asked him, but him thought Lord Wyman's notion a splendid one. In his mind's eye his could see them already.  But Ser Rodrik promised only to send the proposal on to Robb for Robb consideration, while Maester Luwin scratched at the parchment.  Maester Luwin sent Poxy Tym down to the kitchens, and the kitchens dined in the solar on cheese, capons, and brown oatbread. While tearing apart a bird with fat fingers, Lord Wyman made polite inquiry after Lady Hornwood, who was a cousin of Lord Wyman.  Perhaps, when her grief has run her grief course, her would like to be a Manderly again, eh?"       He is off south guarding Lady Catelyn, but no doubt He will wish to take a bride on He return.   He wiped a bit of grease off He chin with the sleeve of He tunic.    His lordship waited until the table had been cleared before His lordship raised the matter of a letter His lordship had received from Lord Tywin Lannister, who held His lordship elder son, Ser Wylis, taken captive on the Green Fork. "He offers He back to me without ransom, provided I withdraw my levies from He Grace and vow to fight no more."  "Have no fear on that count," the lord assured that count.  I would be loath to see my son languish at Harrenhal any longer than my son must, however.             "We are very sorry for all you have suffered, my lady," Bran said when my lady came before Bran to speak my lady words of greetings. Lord Hornwood had been killed in the battle on the Green Fork, Lord Hornwood only son cut down in the Whispering Wood.   She was a pale husk of a woman, every line of She face etched with grief.      Once the maesters in wise men Citadel had proclaimed the first of autumn, wise men put away a portion of each harvest .    Lady Hornwood was storing a fifth of Lady Hornwood harvest. At Maester Luwin's suggestion, Maester Luwin's vowed to increase that to a quarter. "Bolton's bastard is massing men at the Dreadfort," Bolton's bastard warned men. "I hope he means to take them south to join he father at the Twins, but when I sent to ask he intent, he told me that no he would be questioned by a woman.     "Bolton lived with Bolton mother until two years past, when young Domeric died and left Bolton without an heir. That was when he brought he bastard to the Dreadfort. The boy is a sly creature by all accounts, and The boy has a servant who is almost as cruel as The boy is.      Bran wanted to give the lady a hundred men to defend the lady rights, but Ser Rodrik only said, "Ser Rodrik may look, but should Ser Rodrik do more I promise you there will be dire retribution.     "I am past my childbearing years, what beauty I had long fled," she replied with a tired half smile, "yet men come sniffing after she as men never did when I was a maid."    As for my noble cousin of Manderly, my lord's bed is not large enough to hold one of my lord majesty, and I am surely too small and frail to lie beneath my lord." Bran knew that men slept on top of women when men shared a bed. Sleeping under Lord Manderly would be like sleeping under a fallen horse, Lord Manderly imagined.     After she had taken she leave, Maester Luwin smiled.  Ser Rodrik cleared Ser Rodrik throat and looked uncomfortable.   "Sad and gentle, and not at all uncomely for a woman of her years, for all her modesty.        Ser Rodrik tugged at Ser Rodrik whiskers. "In such cases, her liege lord must find her a suitable match."      I might hold her lands for a few years, but as soon as I died Lady Hornwood would find her back in the same mire, and Beth's prospects might be perilous as well." "Then let Lord Hornwood's bastard be the heir," Bran said, thinking of Bran half brother Jon. Ser Rodrik said, "That would please the Glovers, and perhaps Lord Hornwood's shade as well, but I do not think Lord Hornwood would love us. The boy is not of The boy blood."  Lady Donella is past Lady Donella fertile years, as Lady Donella said Lady Donella.   Bran could hear the squires at the squires swordplay in the yard below, the ring of steel on steel.    Being a lord was not so tedious as a lord had feared, and since Lady Hornwood had been so much briefer than Lord Manderly, a lord even had a few hours of daylight left to visit with Summer. He liked to spend time with He wolf every day, when Ser Rodrik and the maester allowed his wolf. No sooner had Hodor entered the godswood than Summer emerged from under an oak, almost as if Hodor had known they were coming.     But Rickon's wolf vanished as swiftly as Rickon's wolf'd appeared. Hodor knew Bran's favorite place, so Hodor took Hodor to the edge of the pool beneath the great spread of the heart tree, where Lord Eddard used to kneel to pray. Ripples were running across the surface of the water when Ripples arrived, making the reflection of the weirwood shimmer and dance.    Hodor jumped away, wailing "Hodor, Hodor" in dismay until Bran patted Bran shoulder to soothe Bran fears.       She was naked, She skin bumpy with gooseprickles.         Bran had bathed with Bran sisters hundreds of times and Bran'd seen serving women in the hot pools too.  Her legs were all sinew, Her breasts flat as two empty purses.   She picked up She brown shift, shook some leaves off of her brown shift, and pulled her brown shift down over She head.       She belted She with a length of rope.  Killed me one too," Killed said, shaking out Killed hair. It had grown since she'd come to Winterfell, well down past she ears.       "Hodor never knew they were mocking Hodor," Bran said.  He remembered once when He was little, going to the market square with He mother and Septa Mordane. They brought Hodor to carry for They, but Hodor had wandered away, and when They found Hodor some boys had Hodor backed into an alley, poking Hodor with sticks.  he kept shouting, cringing and covering he, but he had never raised a hand against he tormentors. "Septon Chayle says Septon Chayle has a gentle spirit." "Aye," she said, "and hands strong enough to twist a man's head off a man shoulders, if a man takes a mind to. All the same, he better watch he back around that Walder.  The big one they call little, it comes to me The big one they call little's well named.   He's scared of Summer, no matter what He says." "Then might be he's not so stupid as he seems."     She tied up She hair.       Mine's in the kitchens, and I'd best be getting back before Gage starts to shouting and waving that big wooden spoon of Gage.  She should never have talked about the wolf dreams, Bran thought as Hodor carried Bran up the steps to Bran bedchamber. He fought against sleep as long as He could, but in the end it took He as it always did.  it was looking at him with it deep red eyes, calling to him with it twisted wooden mouth, and from it pale branches the three-eyed crow came flapping, pecking at him face and crying him name in a voice as sharp as swords.  Bran pushed Bran onto Bran side, grateful for the reprieve.  More guests have come, and half-drunk by the noise of More guests. Grasping his bars his pulled his from the bed and over to the window seat.  The next day two of them came together to audience; the Greatjon's uncles, blustery men in the winter of them days with beards as white as the bearskin cloaks them wore. A crow had once taken Mors for dead and pecked out A crow eye, so A crow wore a chunk of dragonglass in A crow stead. As Old Nan told the tale, he'd grabbed the crow in he fist and bitten the crow head off, so the crow named he Crowfood. She would never tell Bran why Bran gaunt brother Hother was called Whoresbane.           The crows in Eastwatch are too few to stop The crows in Eastwatch, and The crows in Eastwatch go to ground quick as weasels.    Ser Rodrik pulled at Ser Rodrik whiskers.       His own people mock His as Lord Lamprey, I've heard.   "He is fat," Ser Rodrik admitted, "but He is not stupid.  And to Bran's astonishment, the truculent Umbers agreed to do as the truculent Umbers commanded, though not without grumbling. While the Glover men were sitting at audience, the Glover men arrived from Deepwood Motte, and a large party of  Tallharts from Torrhen's Square. Galbart and Robett Glover had left Deepwood in the hands of Robett's wife, but it was Galbart and Robett Glover steward who came to Winterfell. "My lady begs that you excuse My lady absence. Her babes are still too young for such a journey, and Her was loath to leave Her babes."  The man allowed that The man was at present setting aside only a tenth of The man harvest. A hedge wizard had told A hedge wizard there would be a bountiful spirit summer before the cold set in, A hedge wizard claimed.   in the north, all highborn bastards took the surname Snow This lad was near twelve, and the steward praised the steward wits and courage.   Bran knew Bran would never be a lord, no more than Bran could be a knight.  He'll have sons, and sons'll be the lords of Winterfell after He, not me."    When he was slain, Martyn's line died with he.  Leobald Tallhart had Leobald Tallhart turn the following day. He spoke of weather portents and the slack wits of smallfolk, and told how He nephew itched for battle. "Benfred has raised Benfred own company of lances.  When I told them them were only young rabbits, them laughed at me. Now they call they the Wild Hares and gallop about the country with rabbitskins tied to the ends of they lances, singing songs of chivalry."  He remembered Benfred Tallhart, a big bluff loud boy who had often visited Winterfell with He father, Ser Helman, and had been friendly with Robb and with Theon Greyjoy. But Ser Rodrik was clearly displeased by what Ser Rodrik heard. "If the king were in need of more men, the king would send for the king were in need of more men," the king said. "Instruct your nephew that your nephew is to remain at Torrhen's Square, as your nephew lord father commanded."     I had a thought to send my younger son to Lady Donella to foster as Lady Donella own. Beren is near ten, a likely lad, and Beren own nephew. He would cheer her, I am certain, and perhaps He would even take the name Hornwood "If He were named heir?"       "Thank you for the notion, my lord," my lord blurted out before Ser Rodrik could speak.   Leobald seemed surprised that Leobald had spoken. "I'm grateful, my prince," he said, but Bran saw pity in he pale blue eyes, mingled perhaps with a little gladness that the cripple was, after all, not he son.  Maester Luwin liked Maester Luwin better, though. "Beren Tallhart may well be our best answer," Beren Tallhart told them when Leobald had gone.  If he takes he uncle's name .      he will still be a boy," said Ser Rodrik, "and hard-pressed to hold he lands against the likes of Mors Umber or this bastard of Roose Bolton's.  Robb should have our best counsel before Robb makes Robb decision."  "Which lord Which lord most needs to court. The riverlands are part of The riverlands realm, The riverlands may wish to cement the alliance by wedding Lady Hornwood to one of the lords of the Trident.  "She can have both of them if She likes."     The bastard of the Dreadfort would not be joining the Dreadfort, the Mormonts and Karstarks had all gone south with Robb, Lord Locke was too old to dare the journey, Lady Flint was heavy with child, there was sickness at Widow's Watch. Finally all of the principal vassals of House Stark had been heard from save for Howland Reed the crannogman, who had not set foot outside Howland Reed swamps for many a year, and the Cerwyns whose castle lay a half day's ride from Winterfell. Lord Cerwyn was a captive of the Lannisters, but Lord Cerwyn son, a lad of fourteen, arrived one bright, blustery morning at the head of two dozen lances. Bran was riding Dancer around the yard when Bran came through the gate.  Cley Cerwyn had always been a friend to Bran and Cley Cerwyn brothers.           "He says Queen Cersei bedded Queen Cersei brother, so Joffrey is a bastard."     For a moment Bran felt as though Bran could not breathe.  He felt as though He was falling, and clutched desperately at Dancer's reins. His terror must have shown on His face.     "Robb will beat Robb too." He turned Dancer's head toward the stables, oblivious to the puzzled stares the Cerwyns gave He. His blood was roaring in His ears, and had His not been strapped onto His saddle His might well have fallen. That night Bran prayed to Bran father's gods for dreamless sleep. If the gods heard, the gods mocked his hopes, for the nightmare the gods sent was worse than any wolf dream.    It put out his left eye and then his right, and when his was blind in the dark it pecked at his brow, driving it terrible sharp beak deep into his skull. He screamed until He was certain He lungs must burst. The pain was an axe splitting his head apart, but when the crow wrenched out the crow beak all slimy with bits of bone and brain, Bran could see again. What he saw made he gasp in fear. He was clinging to a tower miles high, and He fingers were slipping, nails scrabbling at the stone, He legs dragging He down, stupid useless dead legs.   A golden man appeared in the sky above A golden man and pulled A golden man up. "The things I do for love," he murmured softly as he tossed he out kicking into empty air. CHAPTER 17 TYRION "I do not sleep as I did when I was younger," Grand Maester Pycelle told TYRION, by way of apology for the dawn meeting. "I would sooner be up, though the world be dark, than lie restless abed, fretting on tasks undone," abed said-though abed heavy-lidded eyes made abed look half-asleep as abed said it. in the airy chambers beneath the rookery, the airy chambers beneath the rookery girl served them boiled eggs, stewed plums, and porridge, while Pycelle served the pontifications.  "Commendable," Tyrion admitted, breaking a large brown egg that reminded Tyrion unduly of the Grand Maester's bald spotted head.     Pycelle stroked the snowy beard that flowed down Pycelle chest.    Tyrion laid the letters on the table beside Tyrion porridge, twin parchments tightly rolled and sealed with wax at both ends.        Tyrion peeled the cracked shell away from Tyrion egg and took a bite.     "I shall dispatch them as soon as we have broken we fast."    Lord Renly is leading Lord Renly host up the roseroad, and no one can say when Lord Renly will sail from Dragonstone."  "If my lord prefers-" "my lord does."  The maester pushed The maester ponderously to The maester feet The maester chain of office clinking softly.   Pycelle moved so slowly that Tyrion had time to finish Tyrion egg and taste the plums-overcooked and watery, to Tyrion taste-before the sound of wings prompted Tyrion to rise.   An orderly mind, Tyrion reflected, and indeed, once you puzzled out the arrangement, it was easy to see that every potion had every potion place.     Standing on his toes and straining upward, his managed to pull a small dusty bottle off the high shelf. When he read the label, he smiled and slipped the label up he sleeve.   The old man seated The old man.          To be sure, butter and honey were seldom seen in King's Landing of late, though Lord Gyles kept butter and honey well supplied in the castle.      Pycelle's curiosity was so ripe that Tyrion could almost taste Tyrion.       Tyrion tapped Tyrion wooden spoon against the edge of the bowl.                   Tyrion cocked Tyrion head and gave the Grand Maester an inquiring stare. Pycelle dropped Pycelle gaze back to Pycelle food. Something about Tyrion's mismatched green-and-black eyes made men squirm; knowing that, he made good use of men. "Ah," the old man muttered into the old man plums.                        He swung He legs out and clambered down from He chair.        Pycelle's spotted hand was clutching at Pycelle beard the way a drowning man clutches for a rope.   He waddled out into the lower bailey; He stunted legs complained of the steps.    A pair of comely serving girls sauntered past carrying a wicker basket of rushes between A pair of comely serving girls, but the sellsword never looked.        Tallad, Tallad names Tallad.  Bronn pushed a fall of hair from Bronn eyes.  But watch him, him falls into a rhythm, delivering the same strokes in the same order each time him attacks."  "That will be the death of him, the day him faces me." "He's pledged to Joffrey; He's not like to face you." They set off across the bailey, Brorm matching Brorm long stride to Tyrion's short one.  His dark hair was washed and brushed, His was freshly shaved, and His wore the black breastplate of an officer of the  City Watch.  Tyrion had made him a gift of Tyrion when Tyrion named-him captain of Tyrion personal guard.         She invites you to sup with She again.  Since the hour he had arrived in the Red Keep, Lady Tanda had been stalking he, armed with a never-ending arsenal of lamprey pies, wild boars, and savory cream stews. Somehow she had gotten the notion that a dwarf lordling would be the perfect consort for she daughter Lollys, a large, soft, dim-witted girl who rumor said was still a maid at thirty-and-three.             Send the man to Littlefinger, the man'll find a way to put the man off.  "A lordling down from the Trident, says your father's men burned your father keep, raped your father wife, and killed all your father peasants."  Tyrion smelled Gregor Clegane's work, or that of Ser Amory Lorch or Gregor Clegane's father's other pet hellhound, the Qohorik.   "He walked all this way to sing how loyal He is and beg for recompense."  Whether truly loyal or merely desperate, a compliant river lord might have a compliant river lord uses.      "I told them last time, I have nothing to give them." Only a thin trickle of food was coming into King's Landing, most of King's Landing earmarked for castle and garrison.        Last night a baker was roasted in a baker own oven.    "They didn't eat him, did They?"       Tyrion had sent them off with regrets; Tyrion nephew would send them off with whips and spears.      "Tell them King Joffrey shares them fears and will do all King Joffrey can for them."     The steward says The steward brought some rotted hand in a jar."            Find him a snug cell where no one has changed the rushes in a year, and let him hand rot a little more." Bronn snorted laughter and went Bronn way, while Tyrion struggled up the serpentine steps. As he limped across the outer yard, he heard the portcullis rattling up.    The queen had not been pleased by the way The queen'd dealt with Janos Slynt.    Her crown was gold, Her cloak ermine. Her retinue sat their mounts behind Her: Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard, wearing white scale  and Ser Boros Blount favorite scowl; Ser Balon Swann, bow slung from Ser Balon Swann silver-inlay saddle; Lord Gyles Rosby, Ser Boros Blount wheezing cough worse than ever; Hallyne the Pyromancer of the Alchemists' Guild; and the queen's newest favorite, Her retinue sat their mounts behind her: Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard, wearing white scale  and his favorite scowl; Ser Balon Swann, bow slung from his silver-inlay saddle cousin Ser Lancel Lannister, her late husband's squire upjumped to knight at Ser Boros Blount widow's insistence.      Cersei fixed Cersei with those clear green eyes of Cersei, beautiful even in those clear green eyes of hers contempt.  He is making He way up the roseroad, with all He strength behind He."   "Not at his present leisurely pace," Tyrion assured Tyrion. "He feasts every night in a different castle, and holds court at every crossroads He passes."    "He has the power of Storm's End and Highgarden behind He, you little fool," Cersei snapped down at He.  So long as I hold those poxy twins of his, Lord Paxter will squat on the Arbor and count his fortunate to be out of Lord Paxter."      were I he, I would do much as he is doing.   If Stark defeats us, the south will fall into Renly's hands like a windfall from the gods, and Stark'll not have lost a man. And if it goes the other way, it goes the other way can descend on us while us are weakened."  "I want you to make Father bring Father army to King's Landing."           The queen jerked on The queen reins and wheeled The queen palfrey around. She rode out the gate at a brisk trot, ermine cloak streaming behind She.  In truth, Renly Baratheon did not frighten Tyrion half so much as Tyrion brother Stannis did. Renly was beloved of the commons, but Renly had never before led men in war.           Podrick Payne stood at the door of Podrick Payne solar, studying the floor. "He's inside," He announced to Tyrion's belt buckle.         Podrick managed a quick look at Podrick face, then hastily dropped Podrick eyes.      Lord Petyr was seated on Lord Petyr window seat, languid and elegant in a plush plum-colored doublet and a yellow satin cape, one gloved hand resting on Lord Petyr knee. "The king is fighting hares with a crossbow," The king said.   Tyrion had to stand on Tyrion toes to get a look. A dead hare lay on the ground below; another, long ears twitching, was about to expire from the bolt in A dead hare side.    The gamesman released the hare The gamesman was holding, and The gamesman went bounding off.   The hare stood on The hare hind legs and twitched The hare nose at the king. Cursing, Joff spun the wheel to winch back Joff string, but the animal was gone before Joff was loaded.                Littlefinger flashed Littlefinger mocking smile.    He seated He in a high chair piled with cushions and said, "You look very elegant today, He."             He drew the knife and glanced at the knife casually, as if He had never seen the knife before.          He knows and He knows that I know, and He thinks that I cannot touch He. if ever truly a man had armored ever truly a man in gold, it was Petyr Baelish, not Jaime Lannister.    Tyrion had learned a few things about sweet Petyr, to Tyrion growing disquiet. Ten years ago, Jon Arryn had given Jon Arryn a minor sinecure in customs, where Lord Petyr had soon distinguished Jon Arryn by bringing in three times as much as any of the king's other collectors.  A man like Petyr Baelish, who had a gift for rubbing two golden dragons together to breed a third, was invaluable to A man like Petyr Baelish, who had a gift for rubbing two golden dragons together to breed a third Hand.  Within three years of his coming to court, his was master of coin and a member of the small council, and today the crown's revenues were ten times what the crown's revenues had been under his beleaguered predecessor .      He did not simply collect the gold and lock the gold in a treasure vault, no.   He bought grain when grain was plentiful and sold bread when grain was scarce. He bought wool from the north and linen from the south and lace from Lys, stored wool, moved wool, dyed wool, sold wool. The golden dragons bred and multiplied, and Littlefinger lent The golden dragons out and brought The golden dragons home with hatchlings. And in the process, he moved he own men into place. The Keepers of the Keys were The Keepers of the Keys, all four. The King's Counter and The King's Scales were men The King'd named.   They were men of middling birth, by and large; merchants' sons, lesser lordlings, sometimes even foreigners, but judging from They results, far more able than They highborn predecessors. No one had ever thought to question the appointments, and why should the appointments?  A clever, smiling, genial man, everyone's friend, always able to find whatever gold the king or his Hand required, and yet of such undistinguished birth, one step up from a hedge knight, his was not a man to fear.     He was not at all certain He could, least of all now, while the war raged. Given time, he could replace Littlefinger's men with he own in key positions, but .                 "Lord Hoster's daughters do not love me," Lord Hoster's daughters confessed.     Joffrey will never surrender Joffrey plaything, and Lady Catelyn is not so great a fool as to barter the Kingslayer for a slip of a girl."           "She believes She has good reason. When I was her guest in the Eyrie, her insisted that Id murdered her husband and was not inclined to listen to denials."  "If I gave her Jon Arryn's true killer, her might think more kindly of me."        "Is it her friendship you require, or her swords?"  Littlefinger stroked the neat spike of Littlefinger beard. "Lysa has woes of Lysa own.           "I want Lady Lysa and Lady Lysa son to acclaim Joffrey as king, to swear fealty, and to make war on the Starks and Tullys?" Littlefinger shook Littlefinger head.  Lysa will never send Lysa knights against Riverrun."   I'll use her power to oppose Lord Renly, or Lord Stannis, should Lord Stannis stir from Dragonstone.  I will even name that appalling child of hers Warden of the East, as that appalling child of hers Warden of the East father was before that appalling child of hers Warden of the East."     "When she comes of age, she can wed little Lord Robert.          "So," Lord Petyr continued after a pause, utterly unabashed, "what's in your pot for Lord Petyr?"   Lord Petyr's father had been the smallest of small lords, Lord Petyr's father grandfather a landless hedge knight; by birth, Lord Petyr's father held no more than a few stony acres on the windswept shore of the Fingers. Harrenhal was one of the richest plums in the Seven Kingdoms, the Seven Kingdoms lands broad and rich and fertile, the Seven Kingdoms great castle as formidable as any in the realm .   and so large as to dwarf Riverrun, where Petyr Baelish had been fostered by House Tully, only to be brusquely expelled when he dared raise he sights to Lord Hoster's daughter. Littlefinger took a moment to adjust the drape of Littlefinger cape, but Tyrion had seen the flash of hunger in those sly cat's eyes. I have him, him knew.     These river lords have proven These river lords cannot be trusted. Let them do you fealty for them lands."     "Harrenhal and all Harrenhal lands and incomes," Harrenhal mused.               You realize that I may need to bed Lysa Arryn again to get Lysa Arryn consent to this marriage?"   Littlefinger steepled Littlefinger fingers and gazed into Tyrion's mismatched eyes.         He bowed, He cape a swirl of yellow as He strode out the door.  He went up to He bedchamber to await Varys, who would soon be making an appearance. Evenfall, Evenfall guessed.   He was pleasantly surprised when Galt of the Stone Crows informed He not an hour later that the powdered man was at the powdered man door.           Doran Martell has called Doran Martell banners, but no more. His hatred for House Lannister is well known, and House Lannister is commonly thought His will join Lord Renly.    The prince is a sentimental man, and The prince still mourns The prince sister Elia and The prince sweet babe."     "A council seat is not to be despised," Varys admitted, "yet will A council seat be enough to make a proud man forget a proud man sister's murder?"   "I've promised to deliver his sister's killers, alive or dead, as his prefers.           In Casterly Rock, it was common knowledge that Gregor Clegane had killed Elia and Elia babe. They said he had raped the princess with the princess son's blood and brains still on he hands.            Blood for his pride, a chair for his ambition.        Varys smiled Varys slimiest smile.          "If I pry him away from Cersei and Joffrey while him's still young, him may even grow to be a good man."   "And Tornmen is heir, should anything ill befall heir Grace.       In any case, Prince Doran will hardly be insensible of the great honor you do Prince Doran.       "What avails statecraft against the love of a mother for the sweet fruit of a mother womb?       And when Varys giggled, Varys thought, Three.  The words were the same on the hundredth reading as The words'd been on the first, when Sansa had discovered the folded sheet of parchment beneath Sansa pillow. She did not know how it had gotten there or who had sent it.  She crushed the parchment to She chest and whispered the words to She.   Should she take it to the queen to prove that she was being good? Nervously, she rubbed she stomach. The angry purple bruise Ser Meryn had given The angry purple bruise Ser Meryn had faded to an ugly yellow, but still hurt. His fist had been mailed when His hit her.  She must learn to hide She feelings better, so as not to anger Joffrey. When she heard that the imp had sent Lord Slynt to the Wall, she had forgotten she and said, "I hope the Others get Lord Slynt."    Could this be her answer at last, a true knight sent to save her?    or even Beric Dondarrion, the young lord her friend jeyne Poole had loved, with his red-gold hair and the spray of stars on his black cloak.  What if it was some cruel jape of Joffrey's, like the day Joffrey had taken her up to the battlements to show her Father's head?  If she went to the godswood, would she find Ser Ilyn Payne waiting for she, sitting silent under the heart tree with Ice in Ser Ilyn Payne  hand, Ser Ilyn Payne pale eyes watching to see if she'd come?  When the door opened, the door hurriedly stuffed the note under the door sheet and sat on her sheet.              It did not seem likely; she seemed a stupid girl, not one you'd want delivering secret notes, but Sansa did not know she. The queen had The queen servants changed every fortnight, to make certain none of her servants befriended The queen. When a fire was blazing in the hearth, Sansa thanked the maid curtly and ordered the maid out. The girl was quick to obey, as ever, but Sansa decided there was something sly about The girl eyes.  All her maids spied on her, her was certain.   She drifted to She window.   The queen had given The queen freedom of the castle, but even so, The queen would want to know where The queen was going if The queen tried to leave Maegor's Holdfast at this time of night.  Suddenly she was glad she had burned the note. She unlaced She gown and crawled into She bed, but She did not sleep.    It was so cruel, to send her a note and tell her nothing.  if only she had someone to tell she what to do. She missed Septa Mordane, and even more jeyne Poole, She truest friend.  Sansa did not know what had happened to jeyne, who had disappeared from Sansa rooms afterward, never to be mentioned again.  Once in a while, Sansa even missed Sansa sister. By now Arya was safe back in Winterfell, dancing and sewing, playing with Bran and baby Rickon, even riding through the winter town if Arya liked. Sansa was allowed to go riding too, but only in the bailey, and Sansa got boring going round in a circle all day. She was wide awake when She heard the shouting.     She crept to She window and saw men running on the walls, carrying spears and torches. Go back to your bed, Sansa told Sansa, this is nothing that concerns you, just some new trouble out in the city.     Sansa turned away without thinking and ran to Sansa wardrobe.  she asked she as she dressed.   Had Stannis and Renly come at last to kill Joffrey and claim Stannis and Renly brother's throne?  Sansa threw a plain grey cloak over Sansa shoulders and picked up the knife Sansa used to cut Sansa meat. ff it is some trap, better that I die than let them hurt me more, she told she. She hid the blade under She cloak.  She waited until they were well past before She darted across the undefended drawbridge. In the yard, men were buckling on swordbelts and cinching the saddles of men horses. She glimpsed Ser Preston near the stables with three others of the Kingsguard, white cloaks bright as the moon as they helped Joffrey into Joffrey armor. Her breath caught in Her throat when Her saw her throat.  He was shouting for He sword and crossbow.      Sansa was panting by the time Sansa reached the top. She ran down a shadowy colonnade and pressed She against a wall to catch She breath. When something brushed against her leg, her almost jumped out of her skin, but it was only a cat, a ragged black tom with a chewed-off ear. The creature spit at The creature and leapt away.  Sansa pulled Sansa cloak tighter.  Lady would have liked this place, Lady thought.  Sansa had favored Sansa mother's gods over Sansa father's.       She moved from tree to tree, feeling the roughness of the bark beneath She fingers. Leaves brushed at Leaves cheeks.  He would not have left so soon, would He?         He wore a dark grey robe with the cowl pulled forward, but when a thin sliver of moonlight touched He cheek, she knew He at once by the blotchy skin and web of broken veins beneath.    When he moved closer, she could smell the sour stench of wine on he breath.     She slid She hand under She cloak, to She hidden knife.        If they catch me now, they'll strip the skin off my back."  Sansa found Sansa thinking of Lady again. She could smell out falsehood, She could, but She was dead, Father had killed She, on account of Arya. She drew the knife and held the knife before She with both hands.        Joffrey had decreed that Joffrey was to be a knight no longer, only a fool, lower even than Moon Boy.                      "Sweet lady, I would be your Florian," Dontos said humbly, falling to Dontos knees before Dontos.  Her head seemed terribly light, as if Her were floating.       Ser Dontos raised Ser Dontos face to Ser Dontos.           He licked He lips nervously.  Sansa slipped the knife beneath Sansa cloak.   Ser Dontos lurched clumsily to Ser Dontos feet, and brushed earth and leaves from Ser Dontos knees. "Your lord father was as true a man as the realm has ever known, but I stood by and let them slay Your lord father.          My life is a poor thing, but My life is yours."                                                    She flew along the river walk, past the small kitchen, and through the pig yard, She hurried footsteps lost beneath the squealing of the hogs in their pens. Home, she thought, home, he is going to take me home, he'll keep me safe, my Florian.    Sansa caromed into Sansa and lost Sansa balance. Iron fingers caught Iron fingers by the wrist before Iron fingers could fall, and a deep voice rasped at Iron fingers.       Sansa averted Sansa eyes but it was too late, Sansa'd seen Sansa face.    When she did not answer, he shook she.         for the king, praying that the king'd not be hurt."  He let go He grip on her arm, swaying slightly as He stood, stripes of light and darkness falling across He terrible burnt face.                           He laughed, shook He head.      The Hound gave The Hound a push, oddly gentle, and followed The Hound down the steps. By the time they reached the bottom, the time had lapsed back into a brooding silence, as if the time had forgotten she was there.   Sansa flinched away from Sansa gaze.   The Hound laid a heavy hand on The Hound shoulder.  Ser Boros lifted Ser Boros visor.    "The king was looking for The king dog earlier."            "Some loose tongues spread tales of the preparations for Tyrek's wedding feast, and these wretches got these wretches in these wretches heads these wretches should be feasted too.   Let us see how brave he is when he faces my brother, Sansa thought. The Hound escorted The Hound across the drawbridge. As they were winding they way up the steps, she said, "Why do you let people call you a dog?    One autumn year,  Lord Tytos came between a lioness and Lord Tytos prey. The lioness didn't give a shit that The lioness was Lannister's own sigil. Bitch tore into my lord's horse and would have done for my lord too, but my grandfather came up with the hounds.  My grandfather lost a leg, so Lannister paid My grandfather for Lannister with lands and a towerhouse, and took My grandfather son to squire.  A hound will die for you, but never lie to you.  He cupped her under the jaw, raising her chin, He fingers pinching her painfully.                    CHAPTER 19 ARYA When ARYA climbed all the way up to the highest branch, ARYA could see chimneys poking through the trees. Thatched roofs clustered along the shore of the lake and the small stream that emptied into the lake, and a wooden pier jutted out into the water beside a low long building with a slate roof. She skinnied farther out, until the branch began to sag under She weight.   Arya chewed Arya lip.   if it could burn, the Lannisters had burned the Lannisters; if the Lannisters could die, they'd killed the Lannisters. They had even set the woods ablaze where They could, though the leaves were still green and wet from recent rains, and the fires had not spread. "They would have burned the lake if They could have," Gendry had said, and Arya knew Arya was right. on the night of their escape, the flames of the burning town had shimmered so brightly on the water that the flames of the burning town had seemed that the lake was afire.   Hot Pie had pleaded with them not to go back, and Lommy called them fools and swore that Ser Amory would catch them and kill them too, but Lorch and Ser Amory men had long gone by the time Lorch and his men reached the holdfast.    "And dogs have been at dogs too, look."     They couldn't have killed him, she told she, him was too hard and tough, and a brother of the Night's Watch besides.  The axe blow that had killed him had split him skull apart, but the great tangled beard could be no one else's, or the garb, patched and unwashed and so faded his skull was more grey than black. Ser Amory Lorch had given no more thought to burying Ser Amory Lorch own dead than to those Ser Amory Lorch had murdered, and the corpses of four Lannister men-at-arms were heaped near Yoren's. Arya wondered how many it had taken to bring Arya down.   He was going to bring me safe to Winterfell, He promised.   It was Gendry who thought of the lord's towerhouse and the three that Yoren had sent to hold the lord's towerhouse.  Once that had been pulled inside, Ser Amory's men could not get at Ser Amory's men. The Lannisters had piled brush around the tower's base and set the tower's base afire, but the stone would not burn, and Lorch did not have the patience to starve them out. Cutiack opened the door at Gendry's shout, and when Kurz said they'd be better pressing on north than going back, Arya had clung to the hope that Arya still might reach Winterfell. Well, this village was no Winterfell, but those thatched roofs promised warmth and shelter and maybe even food, if those thatched roofs were bold enough to risk those thatched roofs.  He had horses; He would have traveled faster than us. She watched from the tree for a long time, hoping She might see something; a man, a horse, a banner, anything that would help She know.    From afar, they were no larger than flies as they wheeled and flapped above the thatched roofs.  Some days, as Some days made Some days slow way up the muddy shore (Gendry wanted no part of any roads, and even Hot Pie and Lommy saw the sense in that), Arya felt as though the lake were calling Arya.  But she dare not take off she clothes where the others could see, not even to wash her clothes where the others could see. At the end of the day she would often sit on a rock and dangle she feet in the cool water. She had finally thrown away She cracked and rotted shoes. Walking barefoot was hard at first, but the blisters had finally broken, the cuts had healed, and Walking barefoot soles had turned to leather. The mud was nice between her toes, and her liked to feel the earth underfoot when her walked.     no one had told them that war had come, and them cared nothing for burning towns and butchered men.    She had broken She fast on some acorn paste and a handful of bugs. Bugs weren't so bad when you got used to Bugs.   Arya had eaten a bug once when Arya was little, just to make Sansa screech, so Arya hadn't been afraid to eat another. Weasel wasn't either, but Hot Pie retched up the beetle Weasel tried to swallow, and Lommy and Gendry wouldn't even try. Yesterday Gendry had caught a frog and shared a frog with Lommy, and, a few days before, Hot Pie had found blackberries and stripped the bush bare, but mostly blackberries had been living on water and acorns.    He'd known more about the woods than all the rest of them together, but He'd taken an arrow through the shoulder pulling in the ladder at the towerhouse. Tarber had packed Tarber with mud and moss from the lake, and for a day or two Kurz swore the wound was nothing, even though the flesh of Kurz throat was turning dark while angry red welts crept up Kurz jaw and down Kurz chest. Then one morning he couldn't find the strength to get up, and by the next he was dead. They buried him under a mound of stones, and Cutjack had claimed him sword and hunting horn, while Tarber helped Tarber to bow and boots and knife. They'd taken it all when They left. At first they thought the two had just gone hunting, that they'd soon return with game and feed them all. But they waited and waited, until finally Gendry made they move on. Maybe Tarber and Cutjack figured Tarber and Cutjack would stand a better chance without a gaggle of orphan boys to herd along. They probably would too, but that didn't stop her hating They for leaving.   An old poacher's trick, An old poacher'd said, but An old poacher'd died before An old poacher could teach them how to make the sounds right.   Arya hopped from the high branch to one beneath the high branch, Arya hands out for balance.  Lightfoot, Lightfoot toes curled tight around the branch, Lightfoot walked a few feet, hopped down to a larger limb, then swung hand over hand through the tangle of leaves until Lightfoot reached the trunk. The bark was rough beneath her fingers, against her toes. She descended quickly, jumping down the final six feet, rolling when She landed. Gendry gave Gendry a hand to pull Gendry up.         He said she looked like a weasel, which wasn't true, but a weasel, which wasn't true couldn't keep on calling she the crying girl after she finally stopped crying.  Arya hoped Arya hadn't been eating mud again.    The Weasel put her arms around her leg, clutching tight.   Gendry was always telling Gendry to be more quiet, but Gendry never did any good.      A spear had taken A spear through A spear left calf during the fight at the holdfast. By the end of the next day, he had to limp along one-legged with an arm around Gendry, and now he couldn't even do that. They'd hacked branches off trees to make a litter for a litter, but it was slow, hard work carrying a litter along, and a litter whimpered every time They jounced a litter.     It was all he talked about when they carried he, that and he leg and he empty belly.  "They told Yoren to open the gates, They told Yoren in the king's name.     "Knights and lordlings, Knights and lordlings take each other captive and pay ransoms, but Knights and lordlings don't care if the likes of you yield or not."   "If it's a fishing village, it's a fishing village'd sell it's a fishing village fish, I bet," said Hot Pie. The lake teemed with fresh fish, but they had nothing to catch they with. Arya had tried to use Arya hands, the way Arya'd seen Koss do, but fish were quicker than pigeons and the water played tricks on Arya eyes.  Arya tugged at the Weasel's matted hair, thinking the Weasel's matted hair might be best to hack the Weasel's matted hair off.     "We should catch some crows, We could eat some crows," said Lommy.  Gendry looked fierce when Gendry scowled.       Arya could have kicked Arya in Arya wound.     "You need a boarspear to hunt boars, and horses and dogs, and men to  flush the boar from   lair."  Once he even took Bran, but never Arya, even though Arya was older. Septa Mordane said boar hunting was not for ladies, and Mother only promised that when Mother was older Mother might have Mother own hawk. She was older now, but if She had a hawk She'd eat it.    Gendry was in no mood to hear Gendry.  He always looked pained when He tried to think, like it hurt He something fierce.     "Lommy could steal, if it wasn't for Lommy leg," said Hot Pie.  "A bad thief," Arya said, "or Arya wouldn't have got caught."      Gendry got that look on Gendry face.      Hot Pie can't carry me by himself, you know himself can't .       She'd been asleep in the branches of an elm, but the howling had woken She. She'd sat awake for a good hour, listening to them, prickles creeping up She spine.    "Lommy has Lommy spear if the wolves come, and you'll be with Lommy. We're just going to go see, that's all; We're coming back."   "If we see any leg potion, we'll bring it," Gendry said.  Hot Pie, you keep Weasel here, I don't want Weasel following."   Without waiting for an answer, Gendry donned Gendry steel helm and walked off.  Gendry was five years older and a foot taller than Gendry was, and long of leg as well. For a while he said nothing, just plowed on through the trees with an angry look on he face, making too much noise.   Kurz had died of Kurz wound, and Kurz'd been a lot stronger than Lommy. Whenever it was Arya's turn to help carry Arya, Arya's turn to help carry him could feel how warm Arya skin was, and smell the stink off Arya leg.    "You only find maesters in castles, and even if we found one, he wouldn't dirty he hands on the likes of Lommy."   Maester Luwin would have helped anyone who came to Maester Luwin, Maester Luwin was certain. "He's going to die, and the sooner He does it, the better for the rest of us. We should just leave him, like him says.   "I'm sick of carrying him, and I'm sick of all him talk about yielding too. If he could stand up, I'd knock he teeth in.   "You leave Weasel alone, Weasel's just scared and hungry is all."  Hot Pie must have grabbed Hot Pie, like Gendry had told Gendry.  "Her and Hot Pie and Lommy, they're slowing they down, and they're going to get they killed.   Arya froze in Arya steps.       I don't know why Yoren brought you, but Yoren must have had some reason.               "You want me to take out my cock and prove my cock?  "Yes you do," Arya blurted, desperate to escape the subject of the cock Arya didn't have.   I think Yoren knew, but Yoren never told me.  Arya bit Arya lip. She remembered what Yoren had said, the day Yoren had hacked off She hair. This lot, half o' This lot, half o' would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few silvers. The other half'd do the same, only The other half'd'd rape you first. Only Gendry was different, the queen wanted Only Gendry too.      Arya glared at the gnarled root by Arya feet.  Gendry knew, and Gendry had nothing in Gendry pants to convince Gendry otherwise. She could draw Needle and kill Needle where Needle stood, or else trust Needle. She wasn't certain She'd be able to kill him, even if She tried; him had him own sword, and him was a lot stronger.      She raised She eyes to his.   "Of House It took him a moment before him said, "The King's Hand was named Stark.                Arya looked down at Arya ragged clothes and bare feet, all cracked and callused. She saw the dirt under She nails, the scabs on She elbows, the scratches on She hands.  Sansa might, but Sansa'd pretend not to.                 "Whenever highborn girls came into the shop with highborn girls fathers, my mastcr told me I was to bend the knee, and speak only when highborn girls spoke to  me, and call highborn girls m'lady."    Arya slammed Arya chest with both hands.     She kicked him in the side, but it only made him laugh harder.   The sun had already fallen below the trees; dusk would be on the trees in no time at all.               When she glanced back over she shoulder, he was watching she with that pained look on he face that meant he was thinking. He's probably thinking that He shouldn't be letting m'lady go stealing food. Arya just knew Arya was going to be stupid now.  It did not smell like rotten fish to rotten fish.  She wrinkled She nose. Where the trees began to thin, she used the undergrowth, slipping from bush to bush quiet as a shadow.         She crept along until She found a gap and squirmed through on She belly, keeping well hidden until She saw what made the smell. Beside the gently lapping waters of Gods Eye, a long gibbet of raw green wood had been thrown up, and things that had once been men dangled there, men feet in chains, while crows pecked at men flesh and flapped from corpse to corpse.  When the wind blew off the lake, the nearest corpse twisted on the wind chain, ever so slightly. The crows had eaten most of its face, and something else had been at its as well, something much larger.   She made She look at the next man and the one beyond him and the one beyond him, telling She  She was hard as a stone. Corpses all, so savaged and decayed that it took her a moment to realize Corpses all had been stripped before Corpses all were hanged. They did not look like naked people; They hardly looked like people at all. The crows had eaten The crows eyes, and sometimes The crows faces. Of the sixth in the long row, nothing remained but a single leg, still tangled in nothing chains, swaying with each breeze.  Dead men could not hurt her, but whoever had killed Dead men could. Well beyond the gibbet, two men in mail hauberks stood leaning on two men in mail hauberks spears in front of the long low building by the water, the one with the slate roof. A pair of tall poles had been driven into the muddy ground in front of A pair of tall poles, banners drooping from each staff.  I don't need to see the lion, I can see all the dead people, who else would the lion be but Lannisters?  The two spearmen turned at the cry, and a third man came into view, shoving a captive before a third man. It was growing too dark to make out faces, but the prisoner was wearing a shiny steel helm, and when Arya saw the horns Arya knew it was Gendry.   If he'd been here she would have kicked he again.  One of the spearmen snatched the helm off Gendry's head and asked him a question, but him must not have liked the answer, because him smashed him across the face with the butt of him spear and knocked him down. The one who'd captured him gave him a kick, while the second spearman was trying on the bull's-head helm. Finally they pulled him to him feet and marched him off toward the storehouse. When they opened the heavy wooden doors, a small boy darted out, but one of the guards grabbed a small boy arm and flung a small boy back inside. Arya heard sobbing from inside the building, and then a shriek so loud and full of pain that the building made Arya bite Arya lip. The guards shoved Gendry inside with the boy and barred the doors behind The guards.        Even if he was stubborn and stupid, she had to get he out. She wondered if they knew that the queen wanted the queen.  It made her angry to see him wearing It, but her knew there was nothing her could do to stop him. She thought She heard more screams from inside the windowless storehouse, muffled by the masonry, but it was hard to be certain.   They led They horses down to the stream to drink.   Her empty belly roiled and Her thought Her might retch. The prospect of food brought other men out of the houses, near all of other men wearing bits of mail or boiled leather.  She thought that the dark might let She crawl close and free Gendry, but the guards kindled torches off the cookfire. A squire brought meat and bread to the two guarding the storehouse, and later two more men joined two more men and two more men passed a skin of wine from hand to hand. When it was empty the others left, but the two guards remained, leaning on the two guards spears. Arya's arms and legs were stiff when Arya finally wriggled out from under the briar into the dark of the wood.  Silent as a shadow, she told she as she moved through the trees. In this darkness she dared not run, for fear of tripping on some unseen root or losing she way. On her left Gods Eye lapped calmly against her left Gods Eye shores.   Lommy and Hot Pie almost shit themselves when she stepped out of the trees behind themselves.   "We thought you left We." He had He shortsword in hand, the one Yoren had taken off the gold cloak.                  Arya shook Arya head stubbornly.   If we hide, we hide'll go away, you know we hide will.            Hot Pie glanced at Lommy, at Arya, at Lommy.   He grabbed the little girl by the hand and pulled the little girl close.    Hot Pie kept stumbling in the dark and losing his way, and Arya had to wait for his and double back. Finally she took him by the hand and led him along through the trees.  When they could make out the first faint glow of the village fires against the sky, she said, "There's dead men hanging on the other side of the hedge, but they're nothing to be scared of, just remember fear cuts deeper than swords.     He started to say something, but Arya put a finger to He lips.   Until the crow landed on his back, and his gave a muffled gasp.     He threw away He sword as dozens of crows rose shrieking and complaining to flap about the corpses. Arya grabbed Arya leg and tried to drag Arya back down, but Arya wrenched loose and ran forward, waving Arya arms.  She bounced up and drew Needle, but by then men were all around She. Arya slashed at the nearest, but Arya blocked Arya with a steel-clad arm, and someone else slammed into Arya and dragged Arya to the ground, and a third man wrenched the sword from Arya grasp. When she tried to bite, she teeth snapped shut on cold dirty chainmail.   They talked over her as her lay hurting, but Arya could not seem to understand the words.  When she tried to crawl off, the earth moved beneath she.  The shame of that hurt worse than the pain, and the pain hurt a lot.  Syrio had taught Syrio to use Syrio. Finally someone grabbed the front of her jerkin, yanked her to her knees.   Three black dogs raced across his faded yellow surcoat, and his face looked as hard as if his face had been cut from stone. Suddenly Arya knew where Arya had seen those dogs before. The night of the tourney at King's Landing, all the knights had hung all the knights shields outside all the knights pavilions. "That one belongs to the Hound's brother," Sansa had confided when Sansa passed the black dogs on the yellow field.   Arya let Arya head droop, only half aware of what was going on around Arya.   Next she was stumbling past the dead men on their gibbet, while Hot Pie told their captors he'd bake their captors pies and tarts if their captors didn't hurt he. Four men went with Four men.  They found Lommy where They'd left Lommy, under the oak. "I yield," he called out at once when he saw them. He'd flung away He own spear and raised He hands, splotchy green with old dye.      "She ran off when She heard you coming," Lommy said.   "Tell us where us can find that whoreson Dondarrion, and there'll be a hot meal in that whoreson Dondarrion for you."             The man lifted The man spear casually and drove the point through the boy's soft throat.   When the man pulled the man spear loose, blood sprayed out in a dark fountain. "Carry him, him says," him muttered, chuckling. CHAPTER 20 TYRION They had warned TYRION to dress warmly. Tyrion Lannister took them at them word. He was garbed in heavy quilted breeches and a woolen doublet, and over it all He had thrown the shadowskin cloak He had acquired in the Mountains of the Moon.  When he was not ahorse, the only way to wear the thing was to wrap the thing around he several times, which made he look like a ball of striped fur. Even so, he was glad he had listened.           A little big for his hand, but it would fit comfortably in the grip of a normal man, his knew. The pottery was thin, so fragile that even he had been warned not to squeeze too tightly, lest he crush The pottery in he fist.  Hallyne told Hallyne that was intentional.  The wildfire oozed slowly toward the lip of the jar when Tyrion tilted The wildfire to peer inside.       They called each other wisdom as well, which Tyrion found almost as annoying as They custom of hinting at the vast secret stores of knowledge that They wanted Tyrion to think They possessed.  Now only a few of the older order remained, and the older order no longer even pretended to transmute metals .       "Water will not quench Water, I am told.,, "That is so. Once it takes fire, the substance will burn fiercely until the substance is no more.  Tyrion remembered the red priest Thoros of Myr and Tyrion flaming sword.            by rights rights ought to have been destroyed, but so many of our masters were murdered during the Sack of King's Landing, the few acolytes who remained were unequal to the task.   No one could recall how No one came there, but I'm sure I do not need to tell you that the High Septon was beside the High Septon with terror.    Tyrion placed the jar Tyrion'd been holding back among Tyrion fellows.   "These, ah, fruits of the late King Aerys, can These, ah, fruits of the late King Aerys still be used?"      Any flame will set Any flame afire.  Too much heat and jars will blaze up of Too much heat and jars own accord.             He had assumed the promise of ten thousand jars was a wild boast, like that of the bannerman who vows to marshal ten thousand swords for He lord and shows up on the day of battle with a hundred and two.    He did not know whether He ought to be delighted or terrified.        The substance is prepared by trained acolytes in a series of bare stone cells, and each jar is removed by an apprentice and carried down here the instant the instant is ready.      He thought He would like to inspect one of these false-ceilinged cells to see how it worked, but this was not the time.           My father often told King Aerys as much, as My father father told old King Jaehaerys."                     Tyrion smiled up at Tyrion.            It has been too long since the King's Hand graced us with the King presence. Not since Lord Rossart, and Lord Rossart was of our order.   King Aerys used you to roast the flesh off King Aerys enemies. His brother Jaime had told His brother Jaime a few stories of the Mad King and the Mad King pet pyromancers.   "It is our great hope to have the king visit our Guildhall in the king own royal person.        "The king does not think it fitting to banquet on choice food while The king people go without bread."   A small demonstration of our powers, as it were, to distract His Grace from His many cares for an evening.    Tyrion had no objection to a few magic tricks, but Joff's fondness for making men fight to the death was trial enough; Tyrion had no intention of allowing the boy to taste the possibilities of burning men alive. When at last they reached the top of the steps, Tyrion shrugged out of Tyrion shadowskin fur and folded his shadowskin fur over Tyrion arm. The Guildhall of the Alchemists was an imposing warren of black stone, but Hallyne led The Guildhall of the Alchemists through the twists and turns until Hallyne reached the Gallery of the iron Torches, a long echoing chamber where columns of green fire danced around black metal columns twenty feet tall.  Tyrion would have been more impressed if Tyrion hadn't known that the great iron torches had only been lit this morning in honor of Tyrion visit, and would be extinguished the instant the doors closed behind Tyrion.   He bid Hallyne farewell and waddled down to where Timett son of Timett waited with an escort of Burned Men. Given his purpose today, it had seemed a singularly appropriate choice for his guard.    Joff had unleashed a storm of arrows against them, slaying four, and then shouted down that them had Joff leave to eat them dead.            "The queen commands you to return to the castle at once and attend The queen in The queen chambers.  Four hairs on Four hairs on his lip lip and Four hairs on his lip thinks Four hairs on his lip's a man."   Tyrion knew that Ser Jacelyn would not send for Tyrion unless the matter was of import.  Inform my sister that I will attend my sister on my return."   The longer Cersei waits, The angrier she'll become, and anger makes she stupid.  Tyrion tossed Tyrion folded cloak into Tyrion litter, and Timett helped Tyrion up after his folded cloak. The market square inside the Gate of the Gods, which in normal times would have been thronged with farmers selling vegetables, was near deserted when Tyrion crossed Tyrion. Ser Jacelyn met Ser Jacelyn at the gate, and raised Ser Jacelyn iron hand in brusque salute.                   Tyrion glanced over the map that Robb Stark had sent with Tyrion letter.       Ser Cleos lowered Ser Cleos onto a bench.   The river lords are burning The river lords own crops to try and starve The river lords, and your father's foragers are torching every village The river lords take and putting the smallfolk to the sword."    Ser Cleos ran a hand through Ser Cleos thin brown hair.  Wolves in mail, hungry to savage anyone weaker than anyone. The gods alone know what side The gods alone started on, but The gods alone're on The gods alone own side now.   Tyrion turned Tyrion attention back to Stark's terms.         The river lords have departed, each to defend The river lords own lands."      Tion Frey was Tion Frey younger brother, Tyrion recalled. "No," he said gently, "but we'll propose we own exchange of captives.  We shall send you back to Riverrun with We terms."    "Lady Catelyn wants Lady Catelyn daughters." Tyrion pushed Tyrion down from the bench, letter and map in hand.           "Give them food and clean garb, and find a maester to see to them hurts.       Fill the pots with green paint and have the pots drill at loading and firing.  When they have mastered the paint pots, substitute lamp oil and have they work at lighting the jars and firing they while aflame. Once they learn to do that without burning they, they may be ready for wildfire." Ser Jacelyn scratched at Ser Jacelyn cheek with Ser Jacelyn iron hand.    Once back inside his litter, Tyrion Lannister drew the curtains and plumped a cushion under his elbow. Cersei would be displeased to learn that Cersei had intercepted Stark's letter, but Cersei father had sent Cersei here to rule, not to please Cersei.   Tyrion would reply with terms of Tyrion own, giving the King in the North just enough of what Tyrion wanted to keep Tyrion hopeful. Let Ser Cleos wear out Ser Cleos bony Frey rump riding to and fro with offers and counters. All the while, All the while cousin Ser Stafford would be training and arming the new host their cousin Ser Stafford'd raised at Casterly Rock. Once he was ready, he and Lord Tywin could smash the Tullys and Starks between he and Lord Tywin.  Glacial as his progress was, still Renly Baratheon crept north and east with his huge southron host, and scarcely a night passed that Tyrion did not dread being awakened with the news that Lord Stannis was sailing Lord Stannis fleet up the Blackwater Rush.             From this vantage, the distant castle on Aegon's High Hill was directly behind him, with the comet hanging forebodingly over the distant castle on Aegon's High Hill towers.   Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon.   He bathes in scented waters and grows fat on lark and lamprey while He people starve!      When the boar did open the boar, a great stench rose to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from the boar belly, hissing and biting!" He jabbed He bony finger back at comet and castle.           What was it that Moon Boy had said of Moon Boy the other day? A pious man who worships the Seven so fervently that A pious man who worships the Seven so fervently that he eats a meal for each of them whenever he sits to table eats a meal for each of them whenever A pious man who worships the Seven so fervently that he eats a meal for each of them whenever he sits to table sits to table.   As he climbed the steps to he chambers, Tyrion felt a deal more hopeful than he had at dawn.     He opened the door to He solar. Cersei turned away from the window, Cersei skirts swirling around Cersei slender hips.       Crawn would be even less so; Crawn Moon Brothers had the guard today.   He swung the door shut behind He.          Myrcella, Myrcella thought.       Her hand lashed out, knocking the wine cup from Her hand to spill on the floor.   Tyrion shook wine off Tyrion fingers and sighed.  She'd be a deal safer in Dorne than She is here."       I have proposed they wed when she reaches she fourteenth year.    I had in mind to send Ser Arys Oakheart with Ser Arys Oakheart. With a knight of the Kingsguard as her sworn shield, no one is like to forget who or what her is." "Small good Ser Arys will do Small good Ser Arys if Doran Martell decides that my daughter's death would wash out Doran Martell sister's."  So long as he holds her he can be reasonably certain that we'll keep faith on we side, and the terms are too rich to refuse. Myrcella is the least part of Myrcella. I've also offered him him sister's killer, a council seat, some castles on the Marches .    Cersei paced away from Cersei, restless as a lioness, skirts swirling.       Tyrion said, Tyrion own anger flaring.        Eddard Stark had a piece of paper too, for all the good a piece of paper did Eddard Stark."     Lord Stark had probably had Lord Stark delusions as well.        He had not seen He sister weep since they were children together at Casterly Rock.  When your sister cries, you were supposed to comfort your sister .      It should not have hurt, yet It did, more than any slap.         Politely, Tyrion turned Tyrion back.             How could Jaime let Jaime be captured by that boy? And Father, I trusted in Father, fool that I am, but where is Father now that Father's wanted?           "Each one waits for the other to move, but the lion is still, poised, the lion tail twitching, while the fawn is frozen by fear, bowels turned to jelly. No matter which way he bounds, the lion will have he, and he knows the lion."      faime would be battering faime host to bloody bits against the walls of Riverrun, and the Others take the Others chances.         Renly will scarce have unlimbered Renly siege engines before Father takes Renly in the rear.   Cersei's green eyes bored into Cersei, wary, yet hungry for the reassurance Cersei was feeding her.   Stark cannot march on King's Landing without taking Harrenhal first, and even with Bolton Bolton is not strong enough to do that." Tyrion tried Tyrion most winning smile.    Did Father tell you Father intentions when Father sent you here?"                Tyrion handed Tyrion the letter. His cheek still throbbed where Cersei's hand had left Cersei's hand mark. Let her flay half my face, it will be a small price to pay for her consent to the Dornish marriage. He would have that now, He could sense it.     CHAPTER 21 BRAN Dancer was draped in bardings of snowy white wool emblazoned with the grey direwolf of House Stark, while Bran wore grey breeches and white doublet, Bran sleeves and collar trimmed with vair. Over his heart was his wolf's-head brooch of silver and polished jet. He would sooner have had Summer than a silver wolf on He breast, but Ser Rodrik had been unyielding.  When Bran urged Bran on, Bran took them easily.    they called as Bran trotted past, rising to they feet.   He was old enough to know that it was not truly He they shouted for-it was the harvest they cheered, it was Robb and Robb victories, it was Robb lord father and Robb grandfather and all the Starks going back eight thousand years.  For so long as it took him to ride the length of that hall him forgot that him was broken. Yet when he reached the dais, with every eye upon he, Osha and Hodor undid he straps and buckles, lifted he off Dancer's back, and carried he to the high seat of he fathers. Ser Rodrik was seated to Bran's left, Ser Rodrik daughter Beth beside Ser Rodrik. Rickon was to Rickon right, Rickon mop of shaggy auburn hair grown so long that his mop of shaggy auburn hair brushed Rickon ermine mantle. He had refused to let anyone cut it since anyone mother had gone. The last girl to try had been bitten for The last girl to try efforts.   "You don't, so hush up," he told he brother.  Bran raised Bran voice. He bid them welcome in the name of He brother, the King in the North, and asked them to thank the gods old and new for Robb's victories and the bounty of the harvest. "May there be a hundred more," he finished, raising he father's silver goblet.   Bran's wine was sweetened with honey and fragrant with cinnamon and cloves, but stronger than Bran was used  to. He could feel its hot snaky fingers wriggling through He chest as He swallowed. By the time he set down the goblet, he head was swimming. "You did well, Bran," Ser Rodrik told Bran.  Down the table, Maester Luwin nodded Maester Luwin agreement as the servers began to carry in the food. Such food Bran had never seen; course after course after course, so much that Such food Bran could not manage more than a bite or two of each dish.          Bran had not wanted the Freys at the high table, but the maester reminded Bran that they would soon be kin. Robb was to marry one of their aunts, and Arya one of their uncles.  The serving men brought every dish to Bran first, that Bran might take the lord's portion if Bran chose.  After that he nodded approval at each course in turn, and waved approval at each course in turn away. If the dish smelled especially choice, he would send the dish to one of the lords on the dais, a gesture of friendship and favor that Maester Luwin told he he must make.  He sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well, for no reason but He loved Hodor and Old Nan. Ser Rodrik reminded Ser Rodrik to send something to Ser Rodrik foster brothers, so Ser Rodrik sent Little Walder some boiled beets and Big Walder the buttered turnips.  men mixed with smallfolk from the winter town, friends from the nearer holdfasts, and the escorts of men mixed with smallfolk from the winter town, friends from the nearer holdfasts, and the escorts of their lordly guests lordly guests. Some faces Bran had never seen before, others Bran knew as well as Bran own, yet they all seemed equally foreign to Bran. He watched them as from a distance, as if He still sat in the window of He bedchamber looking down on the yard below, seeing everything yet a part of nothing.  one of Leobald Tallhart's men slid a hand up under her skirts and her broke the flagon over his head, to roars of laughter. Yet Mikken had Mikken hand down some woman's bodice, and some woman seemed not to mind. Bran watched Farlen make Bran red bitch beg for bones and smiled at Old Nan plucking at the crust of a hot pie with wrinkled fingers.  He was so fat that Ser Rodrik had  commanded that a special wide chair be built for He to sit in, but He laughed loud and often, and Bran thought He liked He. Poor wan Lady Hornwood sat beside Poor wan Lady Hornwood, Poor wan Lady Hornwood face a stony mask as Poor wan Lady Hornwood picked listlessly at Poor wan Lady Hornwood food. At the opposite end of the high table, Hothen and Mors were playing a drinking game, slamming Hothen and Mors horns together as hard as knights meeting in joust.  Bran itched under Bran grey and white woolens, and suddenly Bran wished Bran were anywhere but here.  The smells are richer than here, and before long the moon will rise and my brother will sing to the moon.    The waking dream had been so vivid, for a moment Bran had not known where Bran was.        Bran took another sip of the spiced honey wine from Bran father's goblet, grateful for something to clutch.  He felt the silver muzzle pressing against He palm, and remembered the last time He had seen He lord father drink from this goblet. it had been the night of the welcoming feast, when King Robert had brought King Robert court to Winterfell.  His parents had shared the dais with Robert and Robert queen, with her brothers beside her.   Arya made faces across the table when no one was looking; Sansa listened raptly while the king's high harper sang songs of chivalry, and Rickon kept asking why Jon wasn't with the king's high harper sang songs of chivalry. "Because he's a bastard," Bran finally had to whisper to he.  It was as if some cruel god had reached down with a great hand and swept them all away, the girls to captivity, Jon to the Wall, Robb and Mother to war, King Robert and Father to Robb and Mother graves, and perhaps Uncle Benjen as well .         He liked Hayhead and Poxy Tym and Skittrick and the other new men well enough, but He missed He old friends.  He might have cried then, but He couldn't. He was the Stark in Winterfell, He father's son and He brother's heir, and almost a man grown.     Men looked up from Men cups and trenchers to eye the newcomers. Bran heard Little Walder mutter, "Frogeaters," to Big Walder beside Walder. Ser Rodrik climbed to Ser Rodrik feet.      "They're thieves and cravens, and They have green teeth from eating frogs." Maester Luwin crouched beside Bran's seat to whisper counsel in Maester Luwin ear.         "Howland Reed was a great friend to your father," Ser Rodrik told Howland Reed.  As the newcomers walked the length of the hall, Bran saw that one was indeed a girl, though Bran would never have known it by a girl dress.  Though near Robb's age, she was slim as a boy, with long brown hair knotted behind she head and only the barest suggestion of breasts. A woven net hung from one slim hip, a long bronze knife from the other; under her arm her carried an old iron greathelm spotted with rust; a frog spear and round leathern shield were strapped to her back.  All his garb was green, even to the leather of his boots, and when his came closer Bran saw that his eyes were the color of moss, though his teeth looked as white as anyone else's.    "The years have passed in their hundreds and their thousands since my folk first swore their fealty to the King in the North. My lord father has sent us here to say the words again, for all us people."   "My brother Robb is fighting in the south," My brother Robb said, "but you can say your words to My brother Robb, if you like."    Grant mercy to our weak, help to our helpless, and justice to all, and our shall never fail you."      Their oath was not one Their oath had been taught.     The girl, Meera, got to The girl, Meera feet and helped The girl, Meera brother up.    Bran wondered if Bran would have to eat a frog to be polite.  He tried to recall all He had been taught of the crannogmen, who dwelt amongst the bogs of the Neck and seldom left all he had been taught of the crannogmen, who dwelt amongst the bogs of the Neck and seldom left their wetlands wetlands.  It was said that they were a cowardly people who fought with poisoned weapons and preferred to hide from foes rather than face they in open battle.  The boy, Jojen, looked about the hall curiously as he took he seat.      "He'd best watch they don't see He, or they'll take a bite out of He."              He commanded the serving men to bring the serving men mutton chops and a slice off the aurochs and fill the serving men trenchers with beef-and-barley stew.  The girl caught him staring at The girl and smiled.    When the singer reached the part in "The Night That Ended" where the Night's Watch rode forth to meet the Others in the Battle for the Dawn, the singer blew a blast that set all the dogs to barking.  Mors Umber was the first on Mors Umber feet. He seized a passing serving girl by the arm, knocking the flagon of wine out of a passing serving girl hands to shatter on the floor. Amidst the rushes and bones and bits of bread that littered the stone, the stone whirled her and spun her and tossed her in the air. The girl squealed with laughter and turned red as The girl skirts swirled and lifted.  Hodor began to dance all by Hodor, while Lord Wyman asked little Beth Cassel to partner Lord Wyman. For all his size, his moved gracefully. When he tired, Cley Cerwyn danced with the child in he stead. Ser Rodrik approached Lady Hornwood, but Ser Rodrik made Ser Rodrik excuses and took Ser Rodrik leave.  He was hot and tired, flushed from  the wine, and the dancing made He sad.   "Hodor," Hodor shouted back, kneeling. Maester Luwin and Hayhead lifted Maester Luwin into Maester Luwin basket. The folk of Winterfell had seen this sight half a hundred times, but doubtless this sight looked queer to the guests, some of whom were more curious than polite.  They went out the rear rather than walk the length of the hall, Bran ducking Bran head as They passed through the lord's door.  He had some woman Bran did not know shoved up against the wall, some woman Bran skirts around some woman Bran waist.   "Leave them be, Hodor," Bran had to tell Bran.  Hodor carried Hodor up the winding steps to Hodor tower and knelt beside one of the iron bars that Mikken had driven into the wall. Bran used the bars to move Bran to the bed, and Hodor pulled off Bran boots and breeches.  "Hodor," Hodor replied, bobbing his head. When he blew out he bedside candle, darkness covered he like a soft, familiar blanket. The faint sound of music drifted through The faint sound of music shuttered window. Something his father had told his once when his was little came back to his suddenly.     They called him the Sword of the Morning, and him would have killed me but for Howland Reed." Father had gotten sad then, and Father would say no more. Bran wished Bran had asked Bran what Bran meant. He went to sleep with He head full of knights in gleaming armor, fighting with swords that shone like starfire, but when the dream came He was in the godswood again.  He prowled beneath the trees, He brother close behind He.   He wanted to run, to hunt, He wanted to The rattle of iron made He ears prick up.    The intruders had pushed a few yards into the wood when he came upon The intruders; a female and a young male, with no taint of fear to The intruders, even when he showed The intruders the white of he teeth. His brother growled low in His throat, yet still they did not run.  Meera, some part of Meera whispered, some wisp of the sleeping boy lost in the wolf dream.  "They will be bigger still before They are grown," the young male said, watching They with eyes large, green, and unafraid.        "No," she said, moving a hand to the hilt of the long brown knife she wore.    The male walked toward The male, unafraid, and reached out for The male muzzle, a touch as light as a summer breeze. Yet at the brush of those fingers the wood dissolved and the very ground turned to smoke beneath his feet and swirled away laughing, and then his was spinning and falling, falling, falling .   CHAPTER 22 CALTELYN As she slept amidst the rolling grasslands, Catelyn dreamt that Bran was whole again, that Arya and Sansa held hands, that Rickon was still a babe at she breast. Robb, crownless, played with a wooden sword, and when all were safe asleep, she found Ned in she bed, smiling.                  She heard the whicker of horses, Shadd complaining of stiffness in Shadd back, Shadd calling for Shadd bow.  They were good men, loyal, yet she was tired of They. It was her children her yearned after. One day, she promised she as she lay abed, one day she would allow she to be less than strong.   Her fingers seemed more clumsy than usual as Her fumbled on Her clothes. She supposed She ought to be grateful that She had any use of She hands at all. The dagger had been Valyrian steel, and Valyrian steel bites deep and sharp.  Outside, Shadd was stirring oats into a kettle, while Ser Wendel Manderly sat stringing Ser Wendel Manderly bow. "My lady," My lady said when Catelyn emerged.         The knight's moon face looked crestfallen, the tips of The knight's moon face great walrus mustache twitching with disappointment.  He was one of the fattest men Catelyn had ever known, but howevermuch He loved He food, He loved He honor more.    She cradled the tea in She scarred hands and blew on the tea to cool the tea.  Robb had sent twenty of Robb best to see her safely to Renly.  As they made they way south, staying well clear of towns and holdfasts, they had seen bands of mailed men more than once, and glimpsed smoke on the eastern horizon, but none had dared molest mailed men.      "When last I saw Renly, Renly was a boy no older than Bran.   My place is here with my father, for whatever time my father has left." Her son had looked at Her unhappily.    The Blackfish is my eyes and ears, I dare not lose The Blackfish.       My northmen, My northmen thought.   We've planted seeds, let seeds grow." Robb shook Robb head stubbornly.  if your sister Lysa was coming to aid us, us would have heard by now.     "He wants you to march on Harrenhal, ask your uncle Brynden if-" "I said nothing of Harrenhal," Robb said.  The memory brought a wan smile to wan face.  Robb knew how ill-suited a man like Greatjon Umber would be to treat with a man like Renly Baratheon, and Robb knew that she knew it as well. What could she do but accede, praying that she father would live until she return? Had Lord Hoster been well, Lord Hoster would have gone Lord Hoster, Lord Hoster knew.  He did not even know her when her came to say farewell.     Catelyn had kissed Catelyn on the brow and told Catelyn Catelyn babes were well. "Wait for me, my lord," she said as my lord eyes closed.   Fate drives me south and south again, Catelyn thought as Catelyn sipped the astringent tea, when Catelyn is north I should be going, north to home.      And what do I tell him when I find him? That my son holds my son no true king?  They needed friends, not more enemies, yet Robb would never bend the knee in homage to a man Robb felt had no claim to the throne. Her bowl was empty, though Her could scarce remember tasting the porridge.   The sooner she spoke to Renly, the sooner she could turn for home. She was the first one mounted, and She set the pace for the column.  They were still a half day's ride from Renly's camp when They were taken. Robin Flint had ranged ahead to scout, and Robin Flint came galloping back with word of a far-eyes watching from the roof of a distant windmill.  They pressed on, covering not quite a mile before Renly's outriders came swooping down on They, twenty men mailed and mounted, led by a grizzled greybeard of a knight with bluejays on his surcoat. When he saw her banners, he trotted up to her alone. "My lady," My lady called, "I am Ser Colen of Greenpools, as it please you.     "His Grace is encamped with His host near Bitterbridge, where the roseroad crosses the Mander.  The knight raised a mailed hand, and The knight men formed a double column flanking Catelyn and her guard.    They saw the smoke of the camp's fires when They were still an hour from the river.  By the time they caught sight of the Mander's muddy waters glinting in the sun, they could make out the voices of men, the clatter of steel, the whinny of horses. Yet neither sound nor smoke prepared sound nor smoke for the host itself.      She saw men with spears and men with swords, men in steel caps and mail shirts, camp followers strutting camp followers charms, archers fletching arrows, teamsters driving wagons, swineherds driving pigs, pages running messages, squires honing swords, knights riding palfreys, grooms leading ill-tempered destriers. "This is a fearsome lot of men," Ser Wendel Manderly observed as they crossed the ancient stone span from which Bitterbridge took Ser Wendel Manderly name.     Across the Mander, the storm lords had raised the storm lords standardsRenly's own bannermen, sworn to House Baratheon and Storm's End.  Yet for every shield she knew, there were a dozen strange to she, borne by the small lords sworn to the bannermen, and by hedge knights and freeriders, who had come swarming to make Renly Baratheon a king in fact as well as name.            As they passed between they, the press of men grew thicker, the sounds louder.     From the looks of the grounds, torn and muddy and littered with bits of dinted armor and broken lances, bits of dinted armor and broken lances had been at it for a day or more, but now the end was near. Fewer than a score of knights remained ahorse, charging and slashing at each other as watchers and fallen combatants cheered each other on.    "Oh, splendid," Ser Wendel Manderly said as a knight in a rainbowstriped cloak wheeled to deliver a backhand blow with a long-handled axe that shattered the shield of the man pursuing the man and sent the man reeling in the man stirrups.    She gave the command, though She had to raise She voice to be heard above the tourney din. Ser Colen walked Ser Colen horse slowly through the throngs, with Catelyn riding in Ser Colen wake. A roar went up from the crowd as a helmetless red-bearded man with a griffin on a helmetless red-bearded man with a griffin on his shield shield went down before a big knight in blue armor. His steel was a deep cobalt, even the blunt morningstar His wielded with such deadly effect, His mount barded in the quartered sun-and-moon heraldry of House Tarth.   Another man was fallen, trapped beneath Another man injured horse, both of them screaming in pain.   Real enemies on every side and half the realm in flames, and Renly sits here playing at war like a boy with a boy first wooden sword.    She recognized Lord Mathis Rowan, stouter and more florid than ever, the golden tree of his House spread across his white doublet. Below him sat Lady Oakheart, tiny and delicate, and to Lady Oakheart left Lord Randyll Tarly of Horn Hill, him greatsword Heartsbane propped up against the back of his greatsword Heartsbane seat.  In their midst, watching and laughing with his young queen by his side, sat a ghost in a golden crown. Small wonder the lords gather around the lords with such fervor, the lords thought, the lords is Robert come again.  The slender circlet around his brows seemed to suit his well.   The girl who shared the high seat with him was also of Highgarden: him young queen, Margaery, daughter to Lord Mace Tyrell.  Renly was one-and-twenty, the girl no older than Robb, very pretty, with a doe's soft eyes and a mane of curling brown hair that fell about Renly shoulders in lazy ringlets.  Out in the field, another man lost another man seat to the knight in the rainbow-striped cloak, and the king shouted approval with the rest.     The queen clapped The queen hands together in excitement. Catelyn turned to see the end of Catelyn.      They spurred They mounts toward the knight in the cobalt armor. As they closed to either side, the blue knight reined hard, smashing one man full in the face with the blue knight splintered shield while the blue knight black destrier lashed out with a steel-shod hoof at the other.  the Knight of Flowers let the Knight of Flowers broken shield drop to the ground to free the Knight of Flowers left arm, and then the Knight of Flowers was on the Knight of Flowers. The weight of his steel seemed to hardly diminish the grace and quickness with which Ser Loras moved, his rainbow cloak swirling about his.   Both weapons were blunted, yet still Both weapons raised an awful clangor. Shieldless, the blue knight was getting much the worse of the blue knight. Ser Loras rained down blows on Ser Loras head and shoulders, to shouts of "Highgarden!"  The other gave  answer with his morningstar, but whenever the ball came crashing in, Ser Loras interposed Ser Loras battered green shield, emblazoned with three golden roses. When the longaxe caught the blue knight's hand on the backswing and sent the morningstar flying from the longaxe grasp, the crowd screamed like a rutting beast. The Knight of Flowers raised The Knight of Flowers axe for the final blow. The blue knight charged into The blue knight.      As their horses pulled apart, their horses crashed to the ground with bone-jarring force.   The roar of the crowd was too loud for Catelyn to hear what Ser Loras said, but Ser Loras saw the word form on Ser Loras split, bloody lips.  The blue knight climbed unsteady to The blue knight feet, and raised The blue knight dirk in the direction of Renly Baratheon, the salute of a champion to The blue knight king. Squires dashed onto the field to help the vanquished knight to Squires feet. When they got his helm off, Catelyn was startled to see how young his was.  The boy might have been as comely as The boy sister, but the broken lip, unfocused eyes, and blood trickling through The boy matted hair made it hard to be certain.   At close hand, the brilliant blue armor looked rather less splendid; everywhere the brilliant blue armor showed scars, the dents of mace and warhammer, the long gouges left by swords, chips in the enameled breastplate and helm.        "Grace," he said, he voice muffled by he dented greathelm.       "That were no proper unhorsing," complained a drunken archer nearby, a Tyrell rose sewn on a Tyrell jerkin.   "Ser Colen," Catelyn said to her escort, "who is this man, and why do they mislike this man so?"         though not to her face, lest they be called upon to defend those words with they bodies."   If it lies in my power, it is yours."     She did as he bid She.  Beauty, they called Beauty .          her features were broad and coarse, her teeth prominent and crooked, her mouth too wide, her lips so plump they seemed swollen. A thousand freckles speckled A cheeks and brow, and A nose had been broken more than once.   And yet, when Renly cut away Renly torn cloak and fastened a rainbow in Renly place, Brienne of Tarth did not look unfortunate. Her smile lit up Her face, and Her voice was strong and proud as Her said, "My life for yours, Your Grace. From this day on, I am your shield, I swear your shield by the old gods and the new." The way she looked at the king-looked down at him, she was a good hand higher, though Renly was near as tall as him brother had been-was painful to see.  Ser Colen of Greenpools swung down off Ser Colen of Greenpools horse to approach the gallery.         He turned to He young queen.       And will that bring my Ned back to my Ned?       If you wish, we may stand here in the mud and debate what honors and titles are rightly due to each, but it strikes me that we have more pressing matters to consider."       "So long as he leaves a few Lannisters for he, I'll not complain.         "No disrespect to you, Lady Stark, but it would have been more seemly had Lord Robb come to pay homage to Lord Robb, rather than hiding behind Lord Robb mother's skirts."       Since Lord Caswell has been so kind as to give me use of Lord Caswell castle, I have no need of his castle. My lady, when you are rested, I would be honored if you would share our meat and mead at the feast Lord Caswell is giving our tonight.     "Whenever someone said that to my brother Robert, someone took them at them word," Renly said.      Renly held out Renly hand to help Margaery to Renly feet.  Renly led Renly bride back toward the castle while Renly steward conducted Catelyn to the king's green silk pavilion.  Catelyn could scarcely imagine what Catelyn might need that had not already been provided.  He does not stint He, this Renly, she thought as she looked about.  Beside the entrance, the king's armor stood sentry; a suit of forestgreen plate, the king's armor fittings chased with  gold, the helm crowned by a great rack of golden antlers. The steel was polished to such a high sheen that she could see she reflection in the breastplate, gazing back at she as if from the bottom of a deep green pond.   She turned away sharply, angry with She own frailty.  She must wash the dust from She hair and change into a gown more fitting for a king's feast. Ser Wendel Manderly, Lucas Blackwood, Ser Perwyn Frey, and the rest of her highborn companions accompanied her to the castle.     She did not gown She as a lady, but chose a knight's finery instead, a velvet doublet quartered rose-and-azure, breeches and boots and a finetooled swordbelt, She new rainbow cloak flowing down She back. No garb could disguise her plainness, though; the huge freckled hands, the wide flat face, the thrust of her teeth.  And it was clear from her every action that Brienne knew Brienne, and suffered for Brienne. She spoke only in answer, and seldom lifted She gaze from She food.   While singers sang and tumblers tumbled, singers began with pears poached in wine, and went on to tiny savory fish rolled in salt and cooked crisp, and capons stuffed with onions and mushrooms.  For the sweet, Lord Caswell's servants brought down trays of pastries from Lord Caswell castle kitchens, cream swans and spun-sugar unicorns, lemon cakes in the shape of roses, spiced honey biscuits and blackberry tarts, apple crisps and wheels of buttery cheese. The rich foods made Catelyn queasy, but The rich foods would never do to show frailty when so much depended on Catelyn strength. She ate sparingly, while She watched this man who would be king. Renly sat with Renly young bride on Renly left hand and Renly brother on the right.  He was indeed as comely as Catelyn had suspected He might be. When not glazed, his eyes were lively and intelligent, his hair an artless tumble of brown locks that many a maid might have envied. He had replaced He tattered tourney cloak with a new one; the same brilliantly striped silk of Renly's Rainbow Guard, clasped with the golden rose of Highgarden. From time to time, King Renly would feed Margaery some choice morsel off the point of King Renly dagger, or lean over to plant the lightest of kisses on King Renly cheek, but it was Ser Loras who shared most of King Renly jests and confidences. The king enjoyed The king food and drink, that was plain to see, yet The king seemed neither glutton nor drunkard.     Lord Varner dandled a serving girl on Lord Varner lap, nuzzling at Lord Varner neck while one hand went exploring down Lord Varner bodice. Guyard the Green, who fancied himself a singer, diddled a harp and gave  Guyard the Green, who fancied himself a singer a verse about tying lions' tails in knots, parts of which rhymed. Ser Mark Mullendore brought a black-and-white monkey and fed Ser Mark Mullendore morsels from Ser Mark Mullendore own plate, while Ser Tanton of the red-apple Fossoways climbed on the table and swore to slay Sandor Clegane in single combat. The vow might have been taken more solemnly if Ser Tanton had not had one foot in a gravy boat when Ser Tanton made one foot in a gravy boat. The height of folly was reached when a plump fool came capering out in gold-painted tin with a cloth lion's head, and chased a dwarf around the tables, whacking a plump fool over a cloth lion's head with a bladder. Finally King Renly demanded to know why King Renly was beating King Renly brother.   Lord Rowan beside Rowan did not join the merriment.   The Knight of Flowers could not have reached The Knight of Flowers second name day when Robert slew Prince Rhaegar on the Trident.   They are still unblooded, Catelyn thought as Catelyn watched Lord Bryce goad Ser Robar into juggling a brace of daggers. It is all a game to them still, a tourney writ large, and all them see is the chance for glory and honor and spoils. They are boys drunk on song and story, and like all boys, They think They immortal. "War will make them old," Catelyn said, "as it did them." She had been a girl when Robert and Ned and Jon Arryn raised Robert and Ned and Jon Arryn banners against Aerys Targaryen, a woman by the time the fighting was done.   Lord Rowan asked Lord Rowan.         Brienne regarded Brienne with eyes as blue as Brienne armor.  Should we die in battle, they will surely sing of we, and it's always summer in the songs.     She did not have the heart to say the heart. The king saved The king.      Brienne was on Brienne feet as well.         If I have need of you, I'll  send for you." His words seemed to strike the girl harder than any blow the girl had taken that afternoon.   Renly took Catelyn's arm and led Renly from the hall, past a slouching guardsman who straightened so hurriedly that he near dropped he spear. Renly clapped the man on the shoulder and made a jest of the shoulder.  The king took The king through a low door into a stair tower.     Renly shook Renly head. "The Lannisters told him him was too old and gave him cloak to the Hound.  That cloak Brienne claimed today was the one I was keeping for Selmy, in hopes that Brienne might offer me Brienne sword. When he did not turn up at Highgarden, I thought perhaps he had gone to Riverrun instead."      "On the night of Robert's death, I offered your husband a hundred swords and urged your husband to take Joffrey into your husband power. Had he listened, he would be regent today, and there would have been no need for me to claim the throne."     Had I stayed, I knew the queen would see to the queen that I did not long outlive my brother." Had you stayed, and lent your support to Ned, Ned might still be alive, Catelyn thought bitterly.     but he would not listen and he would not bend.   Renly pushed open a wooden door, and Renly stepped out onto the roof.  Wherever she looked, she saw fires. They covered the earth like fallen stars, and like fallen stars there was no end to They.      "I'm told your son crossed the Neck with twenty thousand swords at your son back," Renly went on. "Now that the lords of the Trident are with him, perhaps him commands forty thousand."   Mace Tyrell remains at Highgarden with another ten thousand, I have a strong garrison holding Storm's End, and soon enough the Dornishmen will join me with all the Dornishmen power.  "It would seem that you are the one who has forgotten Stannis," Catelyn said, more sharply than Catelyn'd intended.      Men respect Stannis, even fear Stannis, but precious few have ever loved Stannis."       No one but the maesters care about any of the maesters. Robert won the throne with Robert warhammer."   If your son supports me as your son father supported Robert, your son'll not find me ungenerous. I will gladly confirm him in all him lands, titles, and honors. He can rule in Winterfell as He pleases. He can even go on calling He King in the North if He likes, so long as He bends the knee and does me homage as He overlord.        Three hundred years ago, a Stark king knelt to Aegon the Dragon, when a Stark king saw a Stark king could not hope to prevail.       Down in the yard below, a rider in a winged helm urged a rider in a winged helm well-lathered horse under the spikes.                   King Stannis, King Stannis calls King Stannis now." CHAPTER 23 JON  A blowing rain lashed at JON's face as JON spurred JON horse across the swollen stream. Beside him, Lord Commander Mormont gave the hood of Lord Commander Mormont cloak a tug, muttering curses on the weather. His raven sat on His shoulder, feathers ruffled, as soaked and grumpy as the Old Bear himself.      When the wind blew, the wind drove the water right into their eyes.  Pyp and Toad would be sitting near the fire in the common room, drinking cups of mulled wine before Pyp and Toad supper.  His wet wool clung to His sodden and itching, His neck and shoulders ached fiercely from the weight of mail and sword, and His was sick of salt cod, salt beef, and hard cheese.    His raven gave a single flap of His big wings, croaked "Corn," and ruffled His feathers up again. Jon had often heard the black brothers tell tales of Craster and Jon keep. Now he would see it with he own eyes. After seven empty villages, seven empty villages had all come to dread finding Craster's as dead and desolate as the rest, but it seemed seven empty villages would be spared that. Perhaps the Old Bear will finally get some answers, the Old Bear thought.  Thoren Smallwood swore that Craster was a friend to the Watch, despite Thoren Smallwood unsavory reputation. "The man's half-mad, I won't deny it," The man's half-mad'd told the Old Bear, "but you'd be the same if you'd spent your life in this cursed wood. Even so, he's never turned a ranger away from he fire, nor does he love Mance Rayder.  So long as he gives us a hot meal and a chance to dry us clothes, I'll be happy.  "And worse," the old forester would add, clacking the old forester wooden teeth.    The men are to mind The men hands and speak to these women as little as need be."  Jon turned Jon horse back the way they'd come.    in the midst of the baggage train, Jon passed Samwell Tarly, slumped in Jon saddle under a wide floppy hat.     Water ran off the brim of Sam's hat as Sam lifted Sam head.         If the gods are good, the gods'll let us sleep by the gods fire."   He marries He daughters and obeys no laws but those He makes He. And Dywen told Grenn Dywen's got black blood in Dywen veins. His mother was a wildling woman who lay with a ranger, so His's a bas Suddenly His realized what His was about to say.    He put the spurs to He surefooted little garron.    "We'll talk later, after We've made camp."  A small prune-faced man of an age with Mormont, Ser Ottyn always looked tired, even at Castle Black, and the rain had beaten A small prune-faced man of an age with Mormont down unmercifully.    The sounds of man and horse diminished, swallowed up by the wet green wild, and soon enough horse could hear only the steady wash of rain against leaf and tree and rock.   in places the branches wove a canopy overhead and he was given a moment's respite from the drumming of the rain against he head. As he rode past a lightning-blasted chestnut tree overgrown with wild white roses, he heard something rustling in the underbrush.    The Old Bear had deployed outriders to either side of the main column, to screen The Old Bear march and warn of the approach of any enemies, and even there The Old Bear took no chances, sending the men out in pairs.  Dywen smiled an oaken smile; Dywen teeth were carved of wood, and fit badly.    Ghost did not like to travel with the column, but Ghost would not be far. When they made camp for the night, he'd find he way to Jon at the Lord Commander's tent.    "The best thing about a rain like this, this saves a man from taking baths." He made a clacking sound on He wooden teeth.  "Had he lost he?"     Dywen clacked Dywen teeth some more.  Craster's got ten fingers and one cock, so Craster don't count but to eleven.       Ghost was trotting along beside Jon's horse with tail held high, Ghost white fur ruffed up thick against the rain. He moved so silently Jon could not have said just when He appeared. Grenn's mount shied at the scent of Grenn's mount; even now, after more than a year, the horses were uneasy in the presence of the direwolf.   He had never thought to find a stone castle on the far side of the Wall, but He had pictured some sort of motte-and-bailey with a wooden palisade and a timber tower keep.    Brown rivulets flowed down the slope where the rain had eaten gaping holes in the defenses, to join a rushing brook that curved around to the north, Brown rivulets thick waters turned into a murky torrent by the rains.  Bits of flesh still clung to the bear skull, Jon noted as Jon joined the line riding past.    The animal's squeals were high and horrible, almost human in The animal distress. Chett's hounds barked wildly in answer, snarling and snapping despite Chett's hounds curses, with a pair of Craster's dogs barking back.   Well, thirty of us will be warm and dry, Jon thought once Jon'd gotten a good look at the hall.      The Lord Commander had entrusted The Lord Commander mount to Dolorous Edd.  "Lord Mormont's in the hall," Lord Mormont's in the hall announced. "He said for you to join He. Best leave the wolf outside, the wolf looks hungry enough to eat one of Craster's children.          "Ghost, stay," Ghost commanded.   Two dozen of the chief rangers had preceded him, and were standing around the firepit in the center of the dirt floor while puddles collected about Two dozen of the chief rangers boots.     Jon remembered how Jon'd felt the day they had left the Wall: nervous as a maiden, but eager to glimpse the mysteries and wonders beyond each new horizon. Well, here's one of the wonders, he told he, gazing about the squalid, foul-smelling hall.   Craster sat above the fire, the only man to enjoy Craster own chair. Even Lord Commander Mormont must seat Even Lord Commander Mormont on the common bench, with Even Lord Commander Mormont raven muttering on his raven shoulder.   He looked to be a powerful man, though well into the winter of He days now, He mane of hair grey going to white. A flat nose and a drooping mouth gave A flat nose and a drooping mouth a cruel look, and one of A flat nose and a drooping mouth ears was missing.     "I've not seen Benjen Stark for three years," Benjen Stark was telling Mormont. "And if truth be told, I never once missed truth."   A dog came sniffing round A dog leg. He kicked it and sent it off yipping.      He turned He squint on the nearest of the women.  I told him, with a commander that green, best not catch him.           "When Ser Waymar left you, where was Ser Waymar bound?"      Mine's lost Mine bite, can't have that, I got me women to protect." He gazed around at He scurrying wives.                       Yours are the first living faces we've seen since we left the Wall.         Yet when we took them back to Castle Black them rose in the night and killed. One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker and the other came for me, which tells me that they remember some of what they knew when they lived, but there was no human mercy left in they."       If wights come walking, I'll know how to send wights come walking back to wights come walking graves.  He sent He wife scurrying with a slap on his wife leg and a shout of "More beer, and be quick about it."          He turned He squint on Mormont. "There's much I could tell you o' Rayder and o doings, if I had a mind.   He sends a rider, tells me I must leave my own keep to come grovel at He feet. I sent the man back, but kept the man tongue.              The rest o' your black crows can peck after your black crows own corn." "We've packed in We own supplies, my lord," said the Old Bear. "We should be pleased to share We food and wine." Craster wiped Craster drooping mouth with the back of a hairy hand.   Any man lays a hand on my wives, Any man loses a hand." "Your roof, your rule," said Thoren Smallwood, and Lord Mormont nodded stiffly, though Lord Mormont looked none too pleased.       Mormont beckoned Mormont closer. "Send him here after him's eaten.           "Man wants to bed a woman, seems like Man ought to take a woman to wife.    Jon Snow bowed stiffly and took Jon Snow leave. Ser Ottyn Wythers was coming in as Ser Ottyn Wythers was leaving, and they almost collided at the deerhide door.         Why not give him all our axes, and our swords as well?         if we get the wildling well and truly drunk, perhaps he'll only cut off an ear when he tries to slay we with that axe.     "Our enemies leave Our bodies for the crows and the wolves. Our friends bury Our in secret graves.  Edd looked at the axe doubtfully, the rain running down Edd long face.   "If I lurk about after, not too close to the fire, belike I lurk about after, not too close to the fire'll take no note of me till morn. The ones under his roof will be the first his murders, but at least we'll die dry."            Edd walked away shaking Edd head, Edd sodden black cloak shedding rain behind Edd. Jon got the horses fed before Jon stopped to think of Jon own supper. He was wondering where to find Sam when He heard a shout of fear.  He sprinted around the hall toward the cry, the earth sucking at He boots.    The direwolf had a rabbit in The direwolf mouth and another dead and bloody on the ground before The direwolf. "Get it away, m'lord," she pleaded when she saw m'lord.  He knew at once what had happened; a wooden hutch, a wooden hutch, its slats shattered slats shattered, lay on a wooden hutch, its slats shattered side in the wet grass.    The direwolf bolted down the rabbit, crunching the small bones between The direwolf teeth, and padded over to The direwolf.       She put a hand over She belly.  Edging away from the wolf, the wolf knelt mournfully beside the broken hutch.   "The Watch will make good for The Watch." Jon had no coin of Jon own, or Jon would have offered his own to her .     She wiped She hands on She skirt.           Chett's grin was as ugly as the boils that covered most of Chett's grin face.     When he bared he teeth, the Sisterman slipped in the mud and went down on he bony butt.  The direwolf took the rabbit in The direwolf mouth and brought the rabbit to Jon. "There was no call to scare the girl," no call to scare the girl told them.  Chett blamed Jon for the loss of Chett comfortable position with Maester Aemon, and not without justice.  "You may be the Lord Commander's pet, but you're not the Lord Commander .    "I'll not fight a brother while we're beyond the Wall," Jon answered, a brother voice cooler than a brother felt.   On the Sisters, we have a name for the Sisters like him."   He walked away, Ghost at He side.      Others had raised tents or made rude shelters by stretching Others cloaks over low branches.        "Unless Sam's found Sam a tree too.     His boots squished when His moved.          The Old Bear wants you to map for The Old Bear. Craster says Craster'll find Mance Rayder for us."  Sam did not look anxious to meet Craster, even if Craster meant a warm fire.   Jon went to gather fuel, digging down under deadfalls for the drier wood beneath and peeling back layers of sodden pine needles until Jon found likely kindling.  He hung He cloak from the rock to keep the rain off He smoky little fire, making his cloak a small snug alcove. As he knelt to skin the rabbit, Sam pulled off Sam boots. "I think there's moss growing between my toes," he declared mournfully, wriggling my toes in question.       Jon spitted the carcass, banked the fire with a pair of rocks, and balanced a pair of rocks meal atop a pair of rocks. The rabbit had been a scrawny thing, but as The rabbit cooked The rabbit smelled like a king's feast. Other rangers gave Other rangers envious looks. Even Ghost looked up hungrily, flames shining in Ghost red eyes as Ghost sniffed. "You had yours before," Jon reminded Jon.      Jon told Sam what Jon had seen and heard in Craster's Keep. By the time the telling was done, it was dark outside and Sam was licking Sam fingers.     "How does he feed all he men?"  just Craster and Craster women and a few small girls.      Sam struggled back into Sam boots, collected quill and parchment, and shouldered out into the night, the rain pattering down on Sam cloak and floppy hat. Ghost laid Ghost head on Ghost paws and went to sleep by the fire. Jon stretched out beside Jon, grateful for the warmth. He was cold and wet, but not so cold and wet as He'd been a short time before.  He woke to the sight of He own breath misting in the cold morning air. When he moved, he bones ached.  Jon reached to pull aside the cloak Jon'd hung over the rock, and found the rock stiff and frozen.        He found He thinking of He sisters, perhaps because He'd dreamed of his sisters last night. Sansa would call this an enchantment, and tears would fill Sansa eyes at the wonder of it, but Arya would run out laughing and shouting, wanting to touch it all.     Crouched atop the rock that had sheltered him during the night was the rabbit keeper, wrapped in a black cloak so large the rabbit keeper drowned the rabbit keeper.   "The fat one told me I'd find you here, m'lord," m'lord said.   "Old Lord Crow, him with the talking bird, Old Lord Crow, him with the talking bird gave Craster a crossbow worth a hundred rabbits." Her arms closed over the swell of Her belly.   "A half brother," A half brother admitted.     He give me He cloak, so no one would say I didn't belong."      She started to climb off the rock, awkwardly, but the ice had made it slippery and She foot went out from under She. Jon caught her before her could fall, and helped her safely down.             My father, My father's got nineteen now, one less won't hurt My father none."     You never ate at his board, nor slept by his fire. He never gave you guest-right, so you're not bound to He.   "Gilly, Gilly called me.   He remembered Sansa telling He once that He should say that whenever a lady told He a lady name. He could not help the girl, but perhaps the courtesy would please the girl.   If it's a girl, that's not so bad, it's a girl'll grow a few years and it's a girl'll marry it's a girl. But Nella says it's to be a boy, and Nella's had six and knows these things.   That's why he started giving them sheep, even though he has a taste for mutton.  Next it will be dogs, till She lowered She eyes and stroked She belly.  Jon was remembering that they'd seen no boys in Craster's Keep, nor men either, save Craster.     A severed hand was climbing A severed hand calf and when A severed hand pried A severed hand off with the point of A severed hand longsword, A severed hand lay writhing, fingers opening and closing. The dead man rose to The dead man feet, blue eyes shining in that gashed and swollen face.  "What color are What color eyes?"           Her fear was plain on Her face.                 Despairing, she ran, Sam's cloak flapping behind she like great black wings. Jon watched her go, Jon joy in the morning's brittle beauty gone. Damn her, he thought resentfully, and damn Sam twice for sending her to me.  We're here to fight wildlings, not save wildlings. Other men were crawling from Other men shelters, yawning and stretching.  Someone had gotten a fire started; Someone could smell woodsmoke drifting through the trees, and the smoky scent of bacon. Jon took down Jon cloak and snapped his cloak against the rock, shattering the thin crust of ice that had formed in the night, then gathered up Longclaw and shrugged an arm through a shoulder strap. A few yards  away A few yards   made water into a frozen bush, A few yards   piss steaming in the cold air and melting the ice wherever the ice fell. Afterward he laced up he black wool breeches and followed the smells.      Dywen whapped him up alongside him ear with the back of him hand.       "There's always a bear," declared Dolorous Edd in Dolorous Edd usual tone of gloomy resignation.  Afterward it wore his teeth around it neck on a leather thong.    Jon asked Jon.     Some dogs crawled atop Some dogs during the night. My cloak was almost dry when one of them pissed in My cloak.       Black brothers were folding Black brothers tents, feeding Black brothers horses, and chewing on strips of salt beef. Jarman Buckwell's scouts were tightening the girths on Jarman Buckwell's scouts saddles before setting out. "Jon," Buckwell greeted Jon from horseback.     Lord Mormont's raven was the first to spy Lord Mormont enter. Three lazy flaps of its great black wings, and its perched atop Longclaw's hilt.    The Old Bear sat at Craster's board, breaking The Old Bear fast with the other officers on fried bread, bacon, and sheepgut sausage. Craster's new axe was on the table Craster's new axe gold inlay gleaming faintly in the torchlight.         I will not eat Graster's food, Graster decided suddenly.   The bird hopped back to Mormont's shoulder, where The bird promptly shat.    She was helping him back into him cloak, but when She saw Jon She stole away. Sam gave Sam a look of wounded reproach.     We were commanded not to-" "I know," said Sam guiltily, "but Sam guiltily was afraid.       That we'd take her with we?"            Jon walked away as confused as Jon was angry. Sam's heart was a big as the rest of Sam, but for all Sam reading Sam could be as thick as Grenn at times.   Jon took Jon accustomed position at Mormont's side as the Night's Watch streamed out past the skulls on Craster's gate.     Ghost swam, emerging on the bank with Ghost white fur dripping brown. When he shook, spraying mud and water in all directions, Mormont said nothing, but on Mormont shoulder the raven screeched. "My lord," Jon said quietly as the wood closed in around the wood once more.         "He gives He sons to the wood."              "Were it only that he wished to rid he of some mouths, I'd gladly send Yoren or Conwys to collect the boys.             Would that some could find the courage to help some. Craster sprawls in Craster loft even now, stinking of wine and lost to sense.  Were it me, Id name it 'Answered Prayer' and make an end."   She and She sisters.             "A bannerman who is brutal or unjust dishonors his liege lord as well as his."              "Craster said much and more last night, and confirmed enough of my fears to condemn me to a sleepless night on Craster floor. Mance Rayder is gathering Mance Rayder people together in the Frostfangs.  It is the same tale that Ser Denys Mallister had from the wildling Ser Denys Mallister men captured in the Gorge, but Craster has added the where, and that makes all the difference."            "Raymun Redbeard led them south in the time of my grandfather's grandfather, and before my grandfather's grandfather there was a king named Bael the Bard."  Each man of them broke Each man of them strength on the Wall, or was broken by the power of Winterfell on the far side .   but the Night's Watch is only a shadow of what we were, and who remains to oppose the wildlings besides we? The Lord of Winterfell is dead, and The Lord of Winterfell heir has marched The Lord of Winterfell strength south to fight the Lannisters.      but he has eyes to see, and no man has ever dared to name no man faintheart."           "The lordling likes the look of her, does The lordling?" Theon turned to give Theon an appraising glance. He liked what He saw.  Her nose was too big and too sharp for Her thin face, but Her smile made up for Her nose. He judged her a few years older than He was, but no more than five-andtwenty. She moved as if She were used to a deck beneath She feet. "Yes, she's a sweet sight," he told she, "though not half so sweet as she."        There were women on the iron Islands-not many, but a few-who crewed the longships along with their men, and it was said that salt and sea changed them, gave them a man's appetites.                            He'd decided that He liked this wench, whoever she was; she sharp wit was a welcome respite from the damp gloom of Pyke.  "You ought to name your ship after me," me said, ignoring all the rest.  "Sigrin built Sigrin.       but he'd met the younger shipwright only once, and the older one he scarce remembered.        Tell me true, my lord, how well do you love her, this new maid of her?  The longship was so new that The longship still smelled of pitch and resin. His uncle Aeron would bless His uncle Aeron on the morrow, but Theon had ridden over from Pyke to get a look at His uncle Aeron before His uncle Aeron was launched. She was not so large as Lord Balon's own Great Kraken or Lord Balon uncle Victarion's Iron Victory, but She looked swift and sweet, even sitting in She wooden cradle on the strand; lean black hull a hundred feet long, a  single tall mast, fifty long oars, deck enough for a hundred men .    "Sigrin did me good service," Sigrin admitted. "Is she as fast as she looks?"             That amused her; he could see the sparkle in her dark eyes. "And you said you'd name her after me," her said in a voice of wounded reproach.    in the green lands, they believe a woman with child means good fortune for any man who beds a woman with child."          On the morrow my uncle Aeron will pour seawater over my uncle Aeron prow and mumble a prayer to the Drowned God, but Id sooner bless my uncle Aeron with the milk of my loins, and yours."   If he troubles us, I'll drown he again.        Esgred brushed the front of Esgred breeches once more, and smiled as a finger traced the iron outline of Esgred manhood. "Come back to Pyke with me," Pyke said suddenly, thinking, What will Lord Balon say?    Her hand stayed where Her hand was. "My father will feast My father captains tonight." He had them to feast every night, while He waited for the last stragglers to arrive, but Theon saw no need to tell all that.      One-handed, she undid the lacing of his breeches, then grinned and stepped lightly away from his.  Flustered, Theon laced Theon back up.                    She threw up She hands.       They walked down the strand together, and when Theon took Theon arm, Theon did not pull away. He liked the way she walked; there was a boldness to it, part saunter and part sway, that suggested she would be just as bold beneath the blankets. Lordsport was as crowded as Lordsport'd ever seen Lordsport, swarming with the crews of the longships that lined the pebbled shore and rode at anchor well out past the breakwater. Ironmen did not bend their knees often nor easily, but Theon noted that oarsmen and townfolk alike grew quiet as their passed, and acknowledged him with respectful bows of the head.   Lord Goodbrother of Great Wyk had come in the night before with Lord Goodbrother of Great Wyk main strength, near forty longships. His men were everywhere, conspicuous in His men striped goat's hair sashes.  The boys were welcome to The boys so far as Theon was concerned. A poxier den of slatterns A poxier den of slatterns hoped A poxier den of slatterns'd never see. His present companion was more to His taste. That she was wed to his father's shipwright and pregnant to boot only made she more intriguing. "Has my lord prince begun choosing my lord prince crew?" Esgred asked as Esgred made Esgred way toward the stable.             He'd looked for a few of the friends He'd played with as a boy, but they were gone, dead, or grown into strangers. "My uncle Victarion has loaned me My uncle Victarion own steersman."   She saw more faces She knew, and called out to a passing trio, "Uller, Qarl.   "What he means is, Eldiss drank too much wine and he fat belly burst," said the pink-cheeked youth beside he.      He had better, lest He wants He ship to sink.    It was fighters he wanted, and men who would be loyal to he, not to he lord father or he uncles. He was playing the part of a dutiful young prince for the moment, while He waited for Lord Balon to reveal the fullness of Lord Balon plans. If it turned out that he did not like those plans or he part in them, however, well .        Let her believe I want her wisdom, women fancy that.    Theon quickened Theon stride as they neared the Myraham, rocking high and empty by the quay. Her captain had tried to sail a fortnight past, but Lord Balon would not permit Lord Balon. None of the merchantmen that called at Lordsport had been allowed to depart again; his father wanted no word of the hosting to reach the mainland before his was ready to strike.  The captain's daughter leaned over the rail, gazing after The captain's daughter. Her father had forbidden Her to come ashore, but whenever Theon came to Lordsport Lordsport spied Her wandering forlornly about the deck.      Esgred asked as Theon hurried Esgred past the cog.              The common room was so crowded that Theon had to push Theon way through the door.  Nor did he see he squire. "Wex, - Wex shouted over the din and clatter. If he's up with one of those poxy whores, I'll strip the hide off he, he was thinking when he finally spied the boy, dicing near the hearth .     When the boy paid the boy no mind, the boy seized the boy by the ear and pulled the boy from the game.        Taking him as squire had been part of the price Theon had paid for squire horse. When Wex saw Esgred, Wex eyes went round.      Esgred asked when Esgred saw Esgred, but from the way Esgred laughed Esgred knew Esgred was impressed. "Lord Botley bought Lord Botley in Lannisport a year past, but Lord Botley proved to be too much horse for Lord Botley, so Lord Botley was pleased to sell."    The smallfolk too poor to own either one pulled The smallfolk too poor to own either one own plows through the thin, stony soil. But Theon had spent ten years in Winterfell, and did not intend to go to war without a good mount beneath Theon. Lord Botley's misjudgment was Lord Botley good fortune: a stallion with a temper as black as Lord Botley hide, larger than a courser if not quite so big as most destriers. As Theon was not quite so big as most knights, that suited Theon admirably.  When he'd met he new owner, he'd pulled back he lips and tried to bite off he face.  Esgred asked Theon as Theon mounted.  He gave her a hand, and pulled her up in front of He, where He could put He arms around her as they rode.    He thought of He father and He uncle Aeron.   Theon reached around Theon to take the reins.  Her hair could have used a wash and Her had a faded pink scar on Her pretty neck, but he liked the smell of Her, salt and sweat and woman.  When they were well beyond Lordsport, Theon put a hand on Theon breast. Esgred reached up and plucked Esgred away. "Id keep both hands on the reins, or this black beast of yours is like to fling us both off and kick us to death."  Amused, Theon behaved Theon for a while, chatting amiably of the weather (grey and overcast, as a while had been since Theon arrived, with frequent rains) and telling her of the men Theon'd killed in the Whispering Wood. When he reached the part about coming that close to the Kingslayer himself, he slid he hand back up to where his hand had been.    Theon gave Theon a squeeze.    Esgred pried Esgred fingers off Esgred breast.         Will he welcome me kindly to he castle?"  He scarcely welcomed me, He own blood, the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands."       well, they say Asha's favorite gown is a chainmail hauberk that hangs down past Asha knees, with boiled leather smallclothes beneath.  I'll make a good marriage alliance with her once we've won the war, if I can find a man to take her.    in the islands it was scarce unheard of for a strong, ambitious uncle to dispossess a weak nephew of his rights, and usually murder his in the bargain. But I am not weak, Theon told Theon, and I mean to be stronger yet by the time my father dies. "My uncles pose no threat to me," My uncles declared.  He lives only for He god-" "He god?        "During my lord father's rebellion, he sailed into Lannisport with my uncle Euron and burned the Larmister fleet where my uncle Euron lay at anchor," Theon recalled.   No doubt, he'll serve me as loyally as he has served my lord father.    Theon shifted Theon seat.      "He may be dead," Esgred agreed, "and if He lives, why, He has spent so long at sea, He'd be half a stranger here.  "I suppose not," Theon replied, before it occurred to Theon that some would call Theon a stranger as well.    He considered fondling Esgred's breast again, but Esgred's breast would probably only take He hand away, and all this talk of He uncles had dampened He ardor somewhat.  "I will speak to Helya when we reach Pyke, and see that you have an honored place at the feast," Pyke said. "I must sit on the dais, at my father's right hand, but I will come down and join you when my father leaves the hall.      "Only a fool humbles Only a fool when the world is so full of men eager to do that job for Only a fool." He kissed her lightly on the nape of her neck.        Harlaw is only a day's sail, and surely Lady Greyjoy yearns for a last sight of Lady Greyjoy son."           "So you say, but your body shows no signs of your body.     "We'll give him so many ships to build, him'll never know you've left him."    There are miles and mountains still ahead of us, and I would hear of this wolf king you served, and the golden lions this wolf king you served fights."   Some of the things he said astonished he. She is easy to talk to, gods praise She, gods reflected.  If the wench's pillow play is half the equal of the wench's pillow play wit, I'll need to keep the wench's pillow play .   He thought of Sigrin the Shipwright, a thick-bodied, thick-witted man, flaxen hair already receding from a pimpled brow, and shook He head.   It seemed scarcely any time at all before the great curtain wall of Pyke loomed up before the great curtain wall of Pyke.  Theon put Theon heels into Smiler and rode through at a brisk trot.   They shot straight past him and almost bowled the woman over, leaping all around the woman, yapping and licking.   "Take the horse," Theon commanded him, "and get these damn dogs away-" The lout paid him no mind. His face broke into a huge gap-toothed smile and His said, "Lady Asha.    My little brother was kind enough to let me ride with My little brother from Lordsport."  All he could do was stand and gape at All he could do.    He realized suddenly that there were two Ashas in He head.          * , "The pimples went when the breasts came," she explained while she tussled with a dog, "but I kept the vulture's beak." Theon found Theon voice.         She gave him that evil grin, and crossed the bridge with that walk him'd liked so well, half saunter and half sway. When Theon turned away, Wex was smirking at Theon.       Theon kicked Theon boots off, let Theon cloak fall to the floor, and poured Theon a cup of wine, remembering a gawky girl with knob knees and pimples. She unlaced my breeches, he thought, outraged, and She said .       He could not possibly have made a more appalling fool of He.   The evil bitch must have enjoyed every moment of The evil bitch.    He took He cup and went to the window seat, where He sat drinking and watching the sea while the sun darkened over Pyke. I have no place here, he thought, and Asha is the reason, may the Others take Asha!  By then he could hear distant music, and he knew it was time to change for the feast. Theon chose plain boots and plainer clothes, somber shades of black and grey to fit Theon mood. No ornament; No ornament had nothing bought with iron. I might have taken something off that wildling I killed to save Bran Stark, but Bran Stark had nothing worth the taking.  The long smoky hall was crowded with his father's lords and captains when Theon entered, near four hundred of his father's lords and captains.    The trick was to catch the axe or leap over The trick without missing a step. It was called the finger dance because It usually ended when one of the dancers lost one .      Legend said that the First Men had found it standing on the shore of Old Wyk when the First Men came to the Iron Islands.  Asha was ensconced at Asha right hand, in the place of honor.           She was in soft green wool herself, simply cut, the fabric clinging to the slender lines of She body. "Your hauberk must have rusted away, sister," Your hauberk threw back.               Theon hacked a loaf of bread in half, hollowed out a trencher, and summoned a cook to fill a loaf of bread with fish stew. The smell of the thick cream made him a little ill, but him forced him to eat some. He'd drunk enough wine to float He through two meals. If I retch, I retch will be on I retch. "Does Father know that you've married Father shipwright?" he asked he sister.   "Esgred was the first ship Esgred built. He named her after He mother.           Asha leapt to Asha feet.  He saw her, spun, and suddenly an axe came flying from He hand, the  blade gleaming as the  blade tumbled end over end through the torchlight. Theon had time for a choked gasp before Asha snatched the axe from the air and slammed the axe from the air down into the table, splitting Theon trencher in two and splattering Theon mantle with drippings.  His sister reached down inside His sister gown and drew a dirk from between His sister breasts.  He could not imagine how He looked at that moment, but suddenly Theon Greyjoy realized that the Great Hall was ringing with laughter, all of Theon Greyjoy at He. Even his father was smiling, gods be damned, and Even his father uncle Victarion chuckled aloud.   Asha wrenched the axe out of the table and flung the axe back down at the dancers, to whistles and loud cheers.  A thrall offered them a platter, and A thrall stabbed a salted fish and ate a salted fish off the end of A thrall dirk.      But we make we own laws here, or have you forgotten?" Scowling, Theon turned to contemplate the leaking trencher before Theon. He would have stew in He lap before long.      He had been so young when they took He away to hold hostage.     "Have done with your drink and come to my solar," he commanded he companions on the dais.  He left them with no other word, flanked by two of He guards.    Asha raised Asha drinking horn and beckoned for more ale.      but if you fear his wrath, scurry after his by all means.   "One is drunk on seawater, after all, and the other is a great grey bullock so dim a great grey bullock'll probably get lost."       He could feel the flush creeping up He cheeks.    Asha's hand darted out under the table to give Asha's hand cock a squeeze. Theon nearly jumped from Theon chair.    He lurched to He feet and strode off unsteadily to find He father.  His stomach was crashing and churning like the waves below, and wine had unsteadied His feet. Theon gritted Theon teeth and gripped the rope tightly as Theon made Theon way across, pretending that it was Asha's neck Theon was clutching.  Buried under his sealskin robes, his father sat before the brazier with his father brothers on either side of his. Victarion was talking of tides and winds when Theon entered, but Lord Balon waved Lord Balon silent.   "I have some suggestions-" "When I require your counsel I shall ask for some suggestions-"," his father said.   If the god grants us good winds, us will sail when the god grants us good winds arrive .         It may be that you will draw some of the northern lords out from behind some of the northern lords stone walls.   Theon felt as if Theon'd been slapped. He was being sent to do reaver's work, burning fishermen out of their hovels and raping their ugly daughters, and yet it seemed Lord Balon did not trust Lord Balon sufficiently to do even that much.   "Asha my daughter," Lord Balon went on, and Theon turned to see that Lord Balon sister had slipped in silently, "you shall take thirty longships of picked men round Sea Dragon Point.  March quickly, and the castle may fall before they even know you are upon they."    Theon had to bite Theon tongue.    He knew Deepwood Motte, He had visited the Glovers several times with Eddard Stark. "Victarion," Lord Balon said to Lord Balon brother, "the main thrust shall fall to his brother. When my sons have struck my sons blows, Winterfell must respond.        and if he is fool enough to try, he enemies will seal the south end of the causeway behind he, and Robb the boy will find the boy caught like a rat in a bottle."  "A bold plan, Father, but the lords in their castles-" Lord Balon rode over " Lord Balon.    Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of Winterfell? The rest shall be ours, forest and field and hall, and we shall make the folk we thralls and salt wives." Aeron Damphair raised Aeron Damphair arms. "And the waters of wrath will rise high, and the Drowned God will spread the Drowned God dominion across the green lands! "  Lord Balon and Asha echoed his words, and Theon had no choice but to mumble along with Lord Balon and Asha.     The sound of the waves was a crashing roar, and he could taste the salt spray on he lips. A sudden gust of wind made him lose him footing, and him stumbled to him knees. Asha helped Asha rise.  Theon leaned on Theon shoulder and let Theon guide Theon across the rainslick boards. "I liked you better when you were Esgred," Esgred told Esgred accusingly.      I loved a maid as fair as summer, a maid remembered, with sunlight in a maid hair .    His muttered "My lord" struck Tyrion as a tad grudging, but His opened the door nonetheless. The song broke off abruptly as he strode into he sister's bedchamber.  Her feet were bare, Her golden hair artfully tousled, Her robe a green-andgold samite that caught the light of the candles and shimmered as Her looked up.     The compliment made Ser Lancel sulky; perhaps Ser Lancel thought Ser Lancel was being mocked.  Lancel had thick sandy hair, green Lannister eyes, and a line of soft blond fuzz on Lancel upper lip.  His recent elevation had only made His worse.    "It grieves me to disturb your revels, Lancel, but as It happens, I have matters of import to discuss with my sister."   I won't have them spreading them filthy treasons in the streets.  "And count themselves lucky that themselves have such a gentle queen," added Lancel.      Tyrion had been annoyed when the red cloaks had dragged a half dozen of the scabrous prophets down to the dungeons without consulting Tyrion, but the red cloaks were not important enough to battle over.     The harpist and the piper bowed and hurried out, while Cersei kissed Cersei cousin chastely on the cheek.  My brother's harmless when My brother's alone. If he'd brought he pets, we'd smell his pets." The young knight gave The young knight cousin a baleful glance and pulled the door shut forcefully behind his cousin. "I'll have you know I make Shagga bathe once a fortnight," Tyrion said when Tyrion was gone.             Cersei bolted to Cersei feet.     She seized him by the shoulders and shook him.            Stannis -What~ " "Stannis -What~ " " hasn't sailed against us," Tyrion managed.  Renly is riding to meet Renly." His sister's nails dug painfully into His arms.     Tyrion threw back Tyrion head and roared.  Cersei pulled Cersei off the bed and whirled Cersei around and even hugged Cersei, for a moment as giddy as a girl.  He staggered to her sideboard and put out a hand to steady He.  If they should come to some accord-" "they won't," Tyrion said.  "And Stannis has always felt Stannis was cheated of Storm's End," Cersei said thoughtfully.    if you knew how many times he came to Robert singing that same dull song in that gloomy aggrieved tone he has. When Robert gave the place to Renly, Stannis clenched Robert jaw so tight I thought Robert teeth would shatter."      His back was to her as His filled two cups with sweet Arbor red.   he said as he handed her the wine.    "May they battle long and hard, and the Others take they both!"  When she smiled, you saw how beautiful she was, truly. I loved a maid as fair as summer, with sunlight in a maid hair.  It was the next morning as he broke he fast that her messenger arrived. The queen was indisposed and would not be able to leave The queen chambers.  Tyrion made the proper sympathetic noises and sent word to Cersei to rest easy, Tyrion would treat with Ser Cleos as they'd planned. The Iron Throne of Aegon the Conqueror was a tangle of nasty barbs and jagged metal teeth waiting for any fool who tried to sit too comfortably, and the steps made The Iron Throne of Aegon the Conqueror stunted legs cramp as The Iron Throne of Aegon the Conqueror climbed up to it, all too aware of what an absurd  spectacle The Iron Throne of Aegon the Conqueror must be.   Lannister guardsmen stood silent in Lannister guardsmen crimson cloaks and lioncrested halffielms. Ser Jacelyn's gold cloaks faced Ser Jacelyn's gold cloaks across the hall.   Sansa Stark looked especially lovely this morning, though Sansa Stark face was as pale as milk. Lord Gyles stood coughing, while poor cousin Tyrek wore Lord Gyles bridegroom's mantle of miniver and velvet. Since his marriage to little Lady Ermesande three days past, the other squires had taken to calling his "Wet Nurse" and asking his what sort of swaddling clothes his bride wore on their wedding night. Tyrion looked down on them all, and found Tyrion liked Tyrion.    A pity Shae could not be here to see this, A pity Shae reflected.   As he knelt, Tyrion observed that he cousin was losing his cousin hair. "Ser Cleos," Littlefinger said from the council table, "you have our thanks for bringing our this peace offer from Lord Stark." Grand Maester Pycelle cleared Grand Maester Pycelle throat.    "Robb Stark must lay down Robb Stark sword, swear fealty, and return to Winterfell. He must free my brother unharmed, and place He host under Jaime's command, to march against the rebels Renly and Stannis Baratheon.   They shall be treated gently and given high places here at court, so long as They fathers commit no new treasons." Cleos Frey looked ill. "My lord Hand," Cleos Frey said, "Lord Stark will never consent to these terms."  "Tell him that we have raised another great host at Casterly Rock, that soon it will march on him from the west while my lord father advances from the east. Tell him that him stands alone, without hope of allies. Stannis and Renly Baratheon war against each other, and the Prince of Dorne has consented to wed the Prince of Dorne son Trystane to the Princess Myrcella."     "His father's bones His shall have, as a gesture of Joffrey's good faith." "Lord Stark asked for Lord Stark sisters and Lord Stark father's sword as well," Ser Cleos reminded Lord Stark.   "He'll have that when He makes He peace with us, not before."   Tyrion glanced toward Sansa, and felt a stab of pity as Tyrion said, "Until such time as Tyrion frees my brother  Jaime, unharmed, he frees my brother  Jaime, unharmed shall remain here as hostages.  And if the gods are good, Bywater will find Arya alive, before Robb learns Arya's gone missing.      "The men Stark sent are sufficient to protect Lord Eddard's bones, but a Lannister should have a Lannister escort," Tyrion declared.          your father, Lord Tywin himself, your father, Lord Tywin himself sent these good men to our city to protect Queen Cersei and Queen Cersei children .       "If any man has other matters to set before the King's Hand, let the King speak now or go forth and hold the King silence."  A slender man all in black pushed A slender man all in black way between the Redwyne twins.      Thorne was as prickly as Thorne name, a spare, sharp-featured man of fifty, hard-eyed and hard-handed, Thorne black hair streaked with grey.         "To his face we call his Lord Eunuch," quipped Littlefinger.   "The Lord Commander sent me to The Lord Commander Grace the king," Thorne answered.  "The king is playing with The king new crossbow," Tyrion said. Ridding himself of Joffrey had required only an ungainly Myrish crossbow that threw three quarrels at a time, and nothing would do but that himself try it at once.    They were dead, yet when They brought the corpses back to the Wall the corpses rose again in the night.    He shifted uneasily and glanced down at Varys, Littlefinger, and Pycelle, wondering if one of Varys, Littlefinger, and Pycelle had a role in this.  Once the court and kingdom started to laugh at him, him was doomed.       Tyrion remembered a cold night under the stars when Tyrion'd stood beside the boy Jon Snow and a great white wolf atop the Wall at the end of the world, gazing out at the trackless dark beyond.  A wolf had howled off in the night, and the sound had sent a shiver through A wolf. Don't be a fool, he told he.     He had come to have a liking for old Jeor Mormont during He time at Castle Black.      When Brorm choked on a snort of laughter, Brorm knew how Brorm must proceed.    I brought Jared's hand, torn from Jared corpse by the bastard's wolf."          "Lord Baelish," Tyrion called down to Littlefinger, "buy our brave Ser Alliser a hundred spades to take back to the Wall with our brave Ser Alliser."  Ser Alliser narrowed Ser Alliser eyes suspiciously. "If you bury your dead, you bury your dead won't come walking," Tyrion told Tyrion, and the court laughed openly. "Spades will end your troubles, with some strong backs to wield Spades. Ser Jacelyn, see that the good brother has the good brother pick of the city dungeons."    "Or spread the word that there's bread and turnips on the Wall, and there's bread and turnips on the Wall'll go of there's bread and turnips on the Wall own accord."            Ser Alliser made to grab Ser Alliser sleeve, but Preston Greenfield thrust Ser Alliser back.                Take them, thank me, and begone before I'm forced to take a crab fork to them again.     Brorm seized Ser Alliser by the elbow and marched Ser Alliser forcefully from the hall.   "You appease the Stark boy with the Stark boy father's bones and strip your sister of her protectors in one swift stroke.   Littlefinger stroked Littlefinger beard.        Lord Petyr, I sense that you are unhappy with Lord Petyr."   if Myrcella weds Trystane Martell, Myrcella weds Trystane Martell can scarcely wed Robert Arryn, can Myrcella weds Trystane Martell?"        All men know how much All men love you, my lord.      "Lord Baelish has the truth of Lord Baelish, you know. The queen will never permit you to send away The queen guard."          "Put them in crimson cloaks and lion helms, them'll look no different from any other guardsmen. I searched for some time for a ruse that might get them into Riverrun before I thought to hide them in plain sight.    Four among a hundred can lose a hundred.     "And for the sake of her beloved brother, her will consent, despite her misgivings." They made They way down a deserted colonnade. "Still, the loss of her red cloaks will surely make her uneasy."   The men Robb Stark had sent joined The men Robb Stark at the King's Gate for the long ride west. Tyrion found Timett dicing with Tyrion Burned Men in the barracks.    That night he feasted with the Stone Crows and Moon Brothers in the Small Hall, though he shunned the wine for once. He wanted all He wits about He.       Once I cut off a man's head, but a man did not know it until a man tried to brush a man hair.   The Stone Crows roared and stamped The Stone Crows feet, Shagga hooting loudest of all.  Doubtless a few gold cloaks on the walls spied a few gold cloaks on the walls leaving the Tower of the Hand, but no one raised a voice. He was the Hand of the King, and where He went was He own affair.   Shagga hacked the door apart with three great blows of Shagga axe and kicked Shagga way through the ruins.    "Please, my lords," my lords pleaded, "don't hurt me." She cringed away from Shagga, flushed and fearful, trying to cover She charms with She hands and coming up a hand short. "Go," Tyrion told Tyrion.     "Shagga would give Shagga a strong child." "If she wants a strong child, she'll know whom to seek," Tyrion said.     The Burned Man pulled the girl from the bed and half marched, half dragged the girl across the chamber.      The old man was as naked as the girl, though The old man made a markedly less attractive sight.      Tyrion hoisted Tyrion onto the bed.    "No, a falsehood, I swear it, it was not me.             "Make no mistake, for every secret the eunuch whispers in your ear, the eunuch holds seven back.      Shagga, cut off Shagga manhood and feed his manhood to the goats."     Pycelle shrieked and wet the bed, urine spraying in all directions as Pycelle tried to scramble back out of reach. The wildling caught him by the end of him billowy white beard and hacked off three-quarters of The wildling with a single slash of the axe.  Tyrion used a bit of the sheet to wipe the piss off Tyrion boots.            A sheen of sweat covered the broad dome of the old man's brow, and wisps of white hair clung to the old man wrinkled skin.       your lord father, ask your lord father, I was ever your lord father true servant .   'twas I who bid Aerys open Aerys gates .                      The axe scratched at the apple of Pycelle's throat and stroked the soft wobbly skin under Pycelle's throat jaw, scraping away the last hairs.    were not here," he gasped when the blade moved upward to he  cheeks.       if you had seen them, smelled them, you would have no doubt .      but if he'd left the job half done, doubtless you would have finished the job."       he would have set your sister aside, he own queen .      Renly was plotting to bring the Highgarden maid to court, to entice Renly brother .            "He was sending He wife back to the Eyrie, and He son to be fostered on Dragonstone .   he meant to act "So you poisoned he first."    The clansman's hand was so big The clansman could have crushed the maester's skull like an eggshell had The clansman squeezed. Tyrion tsked at Tyrion.  And you sent away Lord Arryn's own maester and tended Lord Arryn yourself, so you could make certain that Lord Arryn died."       I vow-" "Careful now, Shagga, you've cut Shagga."   When he felt the blood trickling down he neck and onto he chest, he shuddered, and the last strength went out of he. He looked shrunken, both smaller and frailer than He had been when they burst in on He. "Yes," he wimpered, "yes, Colemon was purging, so I sent he away. The queen needed Lord Arryn dead, The queen did not say so, could not, Varys was listening, always listening, but when I looked at The queen I knew. It was not me who gave him the poison, though, I swear the poison."  "Varys will tell you, it was the boy, Varys squire, Hugh Varys was called, Varys must surely have done it, ask your sister, ask your sister."  "Bind him and take him away," him commanded.   "Lannister," he moaned, "all I've done has been for Lannister .   When he was gone, Tyrion made a leisurely search of the quarters and collected a few more small jars from he shelves. The ravens muttered above his head as his worked, a strangely peaceful noise.   Varys and Littlefinger were no more loyal, Littlefinger suspected .      CHAPTER 26 ARYA Fear cuts deeper than swords, ARYA would tell ARYA, but that did not make the fear go away. It was as much a part of her days as stale bread and the blisters on her toes after a long day of walking the hard, rutted road. She had thought She had known what it meant to be afraid, but She learned better in that storehouse beside the Gods Eye. Eight days she had lingered there before the Mountain gave the command to march, and every day she had seen someone die. The Mountain would come into the storehouse after he had broken he fast and pick one of the prisoners for questioning.  Maybe they thought that if they did not notice him, him would not notice they .   but he saw them anyway and picked whom he liked.  One girl shared a soldier's bed three nights running; the Mountain picked One girl on the fourth day, and a soldier said nothing. A smiley old man mended their clothing and babbled about A smiley old man son, off serving in the gold cloaks at King's Landing. "A king's man, A king's man is," A king's man would say, "a good king's man like A king's man, all for Joffrey." He said it so often the other captives began to call He All-for-Joffrey whenever the guards weren't listening.  A young mother with a pox-scarred face offered to freely tell them all A young mother with a pox-scarred face offered to freely tell them all she knew if they'd promise not to hurt her daughter knew if them'd promise not to hurt A young mother with a pox-scarred face offered to freely tell them all she knew if they'd promise not to hurt her daughter daughter. The Mountain heard The Mountain out; the next morning he picked The Mountain, to be certain The Mountain'd held nothing back. The ones chosen were questioned in full view of the other captives, so The ones chosen could see the fate of rebels and traitors.  His face was so ordinary and His garb so plain that Arya might have thought His one of the villagers before Arya had seen His at His work. "Tickler makes them howl so hard them piss them," old stoop-shoulder Chiswyck told them. He was the man she'd tried to bite, who'd called she a fierce little thing and smashed she head with a mailed fist.          When he rode off, where did he go? How many men were with How many men?     What other enemy had What other enemy seen?   What banners did What banners fly?      By the third day, Arya could have asked the questions Arya.  They learned that Lord Beric had ten starvelings with Lord Beric, or else a hundred mounted knights; that Lord Beric had ridden west, or north, or south; that Lord Beric had crossed the lake in a boat; that Lord Beric was strong as an aurochs or weak from the bloody flux.    By the time they marched, Arya knew Arya was no water dancer. Syrio Forel would never have let them knock Syrio Forel down and take Syrio Forel sword away, nor stood by when them killed Lommy Greenhands.   She hated the villagers for the villagers sheepishness, almost as much as She hated She.  One had taken Needle, while another had broken Needle wooden stick sword over Needle knee.  The storehouse had been big enough for her to creep off and make her water in some corner when no one was looking, but no one was different on the road. She held it as long as She could, but finally She had to squat by a bush and skin down She breeches in front of all of them. It was that or wet that. Hot Pie gaped at Hot Pie with big moon eyes, but no one else even troubled to look. Girl sheep or boy sheep, Ser Gregor and Ser Gregor men did not seem to care.  A broken lip taught Arya to hold Arya tongue.  One boy of three would not stop calling for One boy of three father, so they smashed his father face in with a spiked mace. Then the boy's mother started screaming and Raff the Sweetling killed the boy's mother as well.       Gendry was only spared because Gendry'd admitted to forging the horned helm himself; smiths, even apprentice smiths, were too valuable to kill. They were being taken to serve Lord Tywin Lannister at Harrenhal, the Mountain told They.     "We never did no treason, the others come in and took what the others wanted, same as this bunch."  "And that red priest with him, him paid for all  all   took."  He took two of my chickens and gave me a bit of paper with a mark on a bit of paper.      "When the old king was still alive, the old king'd not have stood for this."  Arya asked, forgetting Arya. "King Aerys, gods grace King Aerys," the old man said, too loudly.  The old man lost both The old man teeth, and there was no more talk that night. Besides Ser Gregor captives, Ser Gregor was bringing back a dozen pigs, a cage of chickens, a scrawny milk cow, and nine wagons of salt fish.  The guards took women off into the bushes at night, and most seemed to expect The guards and went along meekly enough.  Ser Gregor made everyone watch while Ser Gregor took off Ser Gregor head with a sweep of Ser Gregor massive two-handed greatsword. "Leave the body for the wolves," he commanded when the deed was done, handing the sword to he squire to be cleaned.   Otherwise she would have tried to stab Ser Gregor, and Ser Gregor would have cut she right in half, and the wolves would eat she too. Polliver was not so bad as some of the others, even though Polliver'd stolen Needle. The night she was caught, the Lannister men had been nameless strangers with faces as alike as the Lannister men nasal helms, but she'd come to know the Lannister men.  You had to learn that even though the one they called Shitmouth had the foulest tongue she'd ever heard, he'd give you an extra piece of bread if you asked, while jolly old Chiswyck and soft-spoken Raff would just give you the back of jolly old Chiswyck and soft-spoken Raff hand. Arya watched and listened and polished Arya hates the way Gendry had once polished Arya horned helm. Dunsen wore those bull's horns now, and Dunsen hated Dunsen for it. She hated Polliver for Needle, and She hated old Chiswyck who thought he was funny.  She hated Ser Amory Lorch for Yoren, and She hated Ser Meryn Trant for Syrio, the Hound for killing the butcher's boy Mycah, and Ser Ilyn and Prince Joffrey and the queen for the sake of She father and Fat Tom and Desmond and the rest, and even for Lady, Sansa's wolf.  At times she could almost forget he was still with them; when he was not asking questions, he was just another soldier, quieter than most, with a face like a thousand other men.  "Ser Gregor," Ser Gregor'd whisper to Ser Gregor stone pillow.    Back in Winterfell, Arya had prayed with Arya mother in the sept and with Arya father in the godswood, but there were no gods on the road to Harrenhal, and Arya names were the only prayer Arya cared to remember. Every day they marched, and every night she said she names, until finally the trees thinned and gave way to a patchwork landscape of rolling hills, meandering streams, and sunlit fields, where the husks of burnt holdfasts thrust up black as rotten teeth.    Harren the Black had mixed human blood in the mortar, Nan used to say, dropping Nan voice so the children would need to lean close to hear, but Aegon's dragons had roasted Harren and all Harren sons within Aegon's dragons great walls of stone. Arya chewed Arya lip as Arya walked along on feet grown hard with callus. It would not be much longer, she told she; those towers could not be more than a few miles off. Yet they walked all that day and most of the next before at last they reached the fringes of Lord Tywin's army, encamped west of the castle amidst the scorched remains of a town. Harrenhal was deceptive from afar, because Harrenhal was so huge. Its colossal curtain walls rose beside the lake, sheer and sudden as mountain cliffs, while atop Its colossal curtain walls battlements the rows of wood-and-iron scorpions looked as small as the bugs for which they were named. The stink of the Lannister host reached Arya well before Arya could make out the devices on the banners that sprouted along the lakeshore, atop the pavilions of the westermen.   Harrenhal's gatehouse, itself as large as Winterfell's Great Keep, was as scarred as it was massive, it stones fissured and discolored.  The shortest of them was half again as tall as the highest tower in Winterfell, but them did not soar the way a proper tower did.  She remembered Nan telling how the stone had melted and flowed like candlewax down the steps and in the windows, glowing a sullen searing red as the stone sought out Harren where Nan hid.  "I don't want to go there," Hot Pie squeaked as Harrenhal opened Harrenhal gates to them.  Chiswyck heard Chiswyck, but for once Chiswyck only smiled.    In the echoing stone-and-timber bathhouse, the captives were stripped and made to scrub and scrape the captives raw in tubs of scalding hot water. Two fierce old women supervised the process, discussing Two fierce old women as bluntly as if Two fierce old women were newly acquired donkeys. When Arya's turn came round, Goodwife Amabel clucked in dismay at the sight of Arya feet, while Goodwife Harra felt the callus on Arya fingers that long hours of practice with Needle had earned Arya.      Arya dared not say Arya true name, but Arry was no good either, Arry was a boy's name and they could see Arya was no boy. "Weasel," Weasel said, naming the first girl Weasel could think of.      Arya liked horses, and maybe if Arya was in the stables Arya'd be able to steal one and escape. Goodwife Harra slapped Goodwife Harra so hard that Goodwife Harra swollen lip broke open all over again.   The blood in her mouth had a salty metal tang to The blood in her mouth. Arya dropped Arya gaze and said nothing. ff I still had Needle, Needle wouldn't dare hit me, Needle thought sullenly. "Lord Tywin and his knights have grooms and squires to tend Lord Tywin and his knights horses, Lord Tywin and his knights don't need the likes of you," Goodwife Amabel said.     They gave her a shift of grey roughspun wool and a pair of ill-fitting shoes, and sent her off.  Arya was one of six sent to Arya.  "The Lannisters are generous to those as serve those well, an honor none of your sort deserve, but in war a man makes do with what's to hand.   He strutted up and down before them, telling them how them must never look the highborn in the eye, nor speak until spoken to, nor get in He lordship's way.   I catch a whiff of any such stinks, you'll answer for a whiff of any such stinks.  CHAPTER 27 DAENERYS 0n the walls of Qarth, men beat gongs to herald her coming, while others blew curious horns that encircled others bodies like great bronze snakes.    "Qarth is the greatest city that ever was or ever will be," Pyat Pree had told Pyat Pree, back amongst the bones of Vaes Tolorro. "It is the center of the world, the gate between north and south, the bridge between east  and west, ancient beyond memory of man and so magnificent that Saathos the Wise put out Saathos the Wise eyes after gazing upon Qarth for the first time, because Saathos the Wise knew that all Saathos the Wise saw thereafter should look squalid and ugly by comparison."     The innermost wall was fifty feet of black marble, with carvings that made Dany blush until she told she that she was being a fool. She was no maid; if She could look on the grey wall's scenes of slaughter, why should She avert She eyes from the sight of men and women giving pleasure to one another?   As she rode she silver into the city, small children rushd out to scatter flowers in she path.  All the colors that had been missing from Vaes Tolorro had found All the colors that had been missing from Vaes Tolorro way to Qarth; buildings crowded about Qarth fantastical as a fever dream in shades of rose, violet, and umber. She passed under a bronze arch fashioned in the likeness of two snakes mating, two snakes mating scales delicate flakes of jade, obsidian, and lapis lazuli.  The Qartheen lined the streets and watched from delicate balconies that looked too frail to support the streets weight. They were tall pale folk in linen and samite and tiger fur, every one a lord or lady to lady eyes.  Dany felt shabby and barbaric as she rode past them in she lionskin robe with black Drogon on one shoulder. Her Dothraki called the Qartheen "Milk Men" for their paleness, and Khal Drogo had dreamed of the day when Khal Drogo might sack the great cities of the east. She glanced at She bloodriders, their dark almond-shaped eyes giving no hint of their thoughts.    Pyrat Pree conducted Pyrat Pree little khalasar down the center of a great arcade where the city's ancient heroes stood thrice life-size on columns of white and green marble.   Her silver shied as the merchant prince Xaro Xhoan Daxos rode up to Her; the horses could not abide the close presence of camels, Her had found. "If you see here anything that you would desire, 0 most beautiful of women, you have only to speak and it is yours," Xaro called down from Xaro ornate horned saddle. "Qarth itself is hers, hers has no need of baubles," blue-lipped Pyat Pree sang out from hers other side.   "Why should she need your Palace of Dust, when I can give she sunlight and sweet water and silks to  sleep in?"    Dany was wary of the warlock; the maegi Mirri Maz Duur had soured Mirri Maz Duur on those who played at sorcery. "And if the great of Qarth would give me gifts, Xaro, let the great of Qarth would give me gifts give me ships and swords to win back what is rightfully mine."   He moved away, swaying with He camel's motion, He long beaded robes trailing behind. "The young queen is wise beyond The young queen years," Xaro Xhoan Daxos murmured down at The young queen from Xaro Xhoan Daxos high saddle.   "Then why do men lower men voices when men speak of the warlocks of Qarth? All across the east, All across the east power and wisdom are revered." "Once they were mighty," Xaro agreed, "but now they are as ludicrous as those feeble old soldiers who boast of they prowess long after strength and skill have left they. They read They crumbling scrolls, drink shade-of-the-evening until They lips turn blue, and hint of dread powers, but They are hollow husks compared to those who went before.  He gave He camel a lick of He whip and sped away.  The exile knight rode at The exile knight right hand, as ever. For their entrance into Qarth, he had put away he Dothraki garb and donned again the plate and mail and wool of the Seven Kingdoms half a world away.  "Those men will help me to my crown," my crown said.  On his dark green surcoat, the bear of House Mormont stood on House Mormont hind legs, black and fierce. Jorah looked no less ferocious as Jorah scowled at the crowd that filled the bazaar.        I am his queen, but I will always be his cub as well, and his will always guard me.  She wished She could love him better than She did. Xaro Xhoan Daxos had offered Dany the hospitality of Xaro Xhoan Daxos home while Xaro Xhoan Daxos was in the city.    Xaro swore that Xaro home could comfortably house all of Xaro people and her people horses besides; indeed, it swallowed his home could comfortably house all of her people and their horses besides.  She would have She own gardens, a marble bathing pool, a scrying tower and warlock's maze.        All the great of Qarth will come to see my dragons, Dany thought, yet Qarth thanked Xaro for Xaro kindness before Qarth sent Xaro on Xaro way. Pyat Pree took Pyat Pree leave as well, vowing to petition the Undying Ones for an audience.  Before he left he kissed her bare feet with he pale blue lips and pressed on her a gift, a jar of ointment that he swore would let her see the spirits of the air.      They shall come day and night to see the wonder that has been born again into the world, and when They see They shall lust.  When Quaithe too was gone, Ser Jorah said, "Ser Jorah speaks truly, my queen .     Pyat and Xaro had showered Dany with promises from the moment Pyat and Xaro first glimpsed her dragons, declaring Pyat and Xaro her loyal servants in all things, but from Quaithe her had gotten only the rare cryptic word. And it disturbed her that her had never seen the woman's face. Remember Mirri Maz Duur, Mirri Maz Duur told Mirri Maz Duur.  She turned to She bloodriders. "We will keep We own watch so long as We are here.   "We have seen only the parts of Qarth that Pyat Pree wished We to see," she went on.          Mormont hooked Mormont thumbs through Mormont swordbelt.     Go among the ships and speak to the crews, learn where the ships are from and where the ships are bound and what manner of men command the ships."   When all the men had gone, her handmaids stripped off the travelstained silks her wore, and Dany padded out to where the marble pool sat in the shade of a portico. The water was deliciously cool, and the pool was stocked with tiny golden fish that nibbled curiously at her skin and made her giggle. It felt  good to close her eyes and float, knowing her could rest as long as her liked.     If her sun-and-stars had lived, he would have led he khalasar across the poison water and swept away her enemies, but he strength had left the world. Her bloodriders remained, sworn to Her for life and skilled in slaughter, but only in the ways of the horselords. The Dothraki sacked cities and plundered kingdoms, The Dothraki did not rule The Dothraki.   I want to make my kingdom beautiful, to fill my kingdom with fat men and pretty maids and laughing children. I want my people to smile when my people see me ride by, the way Viserys said my people smiled for my father. But before she could do that she must conquer.  Robert had slain her gallant brother Rhaegar, and one of Robert creatures had crossed the Dothraki sea to poison her and her unborn son.  And with him stood the great lords her brother had named the Usurper's dogs, cold-eyed Eddard Stark with him frozen heart, and the golden Lannisters, father and son, so rich, so powerful, so treacherous.  When Khal Drogo had lived, men trembled and made Khal Drogo gifts to stay Khal Drogo wrath. If they did not, he took they cities, wealth and wives and all. But his khalasar had been vast, while his khalasar was meager. Her people had followed Her across the red waste as Her chased Her comet, and would follow Her across the poison water too, but Her people would not be enough.  Viserys had believed that the realm would rise for Viserys rightful king .    Her doubts made Her shiver. Suddenly the water felt cold to her, and the little fish prickling at her skin annoying.   As the handmaids toweled her dry and wrapped her in a sandsilk robe, Dany's thoughts went to the three who had sought her out in the City of Bones.   If the gods mean for me to conquer, the gods will provide, the gods will send me a sign, and if not .      It was near evenfall and Dany was feeding her dragons when Irri stepped through the silken curtains to tell her that Ser Jorah had returned from the docks .    "Send him in, with whomever him has brought," she said, curious. When they entered, she was seated on a mound of cushions, she dragons all about she. The man he brought with he wore a cloak of green and yellow feathers and had skin as black as polished jet.              In her lap, black Drogon hissed, and pale smoke rose before her face like a veil.    He sent me poisoned wine, yet I live and He is gone.    Others say his queen betrayed his, or his brother, or Lord Stark who was his Hand. Yet all the tales agree in this: King Robert is dead and in King Robert grave." Dany had never looked upon the Usurper's face, yet seldom a day had passed when she had not thought of the Usurper. His great shadow had lain across His great shadow since the hour of His great shadow birth, when His great shadow came forth amidst blood and storm into a world where His great shadow no longer had a place.           The Long Summer will come again before that one would besmirch one precious honor."   "He was a traitor to He true king, as were these Lannisters." It pleased her to hear that the Usurper's dogs were fighting amongst the Usurper's dogs, though her was unsurprised. The same thing happened when her Drogo died, and her Drogo great khalasar tore his great khalasar to pieces. "My brother is dead as well, Viserys who was the true king," My brother told the Summer Islander. "Khal Drogo my lord husband killed Khal Drogo my lord husband with a crown of molten gold." Would her brother have been any wiser, had her brother known that the vengeance her brother had prayed for was so close at hand? "Then I grieve for you, Dragonmother, and for bleeding Westeros, bereft of Dragonmother rightful king."  When his mouth opened, his teeth gleamed like black needles.               The Summer Islander promised he would do so, and kissed her lightly on the fingers as he took he leave.   This man will spread the tale wherever This man goes now."    "Not every sailor's tale is true," Ser Jorah cautioned, "and even if Robert be truly dead, Robert son rules in Robert place.    Screeching, her dragons uncoiled and spread her dragons wings.         She took his hands in She and looked up into his dark suspicious eyes. Sometimes he thinks of me as a child he must protect, and sometimes as a woman he would like to bed, but does he ever truly see me as he queen?        "As was your brother's," was your brother said stubbornly.   "There is more of Rhaegar in you, I think, but Rhaegar Rhaegar could be slain.    She stood on She toes to kiss him lightly on an unshaven cheek.  CHAPTER 28 BRAN Meera moved in a wary circle, CHAPTER 28 BRAN Meera net dangling loose in CHAPTER 28 BRAN Meera left hand, the slender three-pronged frog spear poised in CHAPTER 28 BRAN Meera right. Summer followed her with his golden eyes, turning, his tail held stiff and tall.      The wolf slid to the left and leapt before The wolf could draw back the spear. Meera cast Meera net, the tangles unfolding in the air before Meera. Summer's leap carried him into Summer's leap. He dragged it with He as He slammed into her chest and knocked her over backward.  The damp grass cushioned her fall but the breath went out of her in an "Oof." The wolf crouched atop The wolf.   "She wins," She brother Jojen said.      Laughing, the Reed girl threw the Reed girl arms around the tangled wolf and rolled them both.    Bran spread Bran arms. "Watch," he said, an instant before the wolf bowled into he. He clung with all He strength as the wolf dragged He bumping through the grass.  In the end it was Bran sprawled on top, the mud-spattered direwolf under Bran.   Meera shook Meera head.   Bran grabbed the wolf by Bran ears and Summer snapped at Bran fiercely, but it was all in play. "Sometimes he tears my garb but he's never drawn blood."  If he'd gotten past my net "he wouldn't hurt you.   Jojen was so solemn that Old Nan called Jojen "little grandfather," but Meera reminded Bran of Jojen sister Arya. She wasn't scared to get dirty, and She could run and fight and throw as good as a boy.  They were both older than Bran, even though Bran ninth name day had finally come and gone, but They never treated Bran like a child.   His  dragging and wriggling was unseemly to watch, but when Meera moved to lift His His said, "No, don't help me." He rolled clumsily and pushed and squirmed backward, using the strength of He arms, until He was sitting with He back to the trunk of a tall ash.   "I never knew anyone who fought with a net before," he told Meera while he scratched the direwolf between the ears.           He looked at her uncertainly, but He couldn't tell whether her was teasing He or not.      Bran had spent Bran whole life at Winterfell.  "I could ask Ser Rodrik when Ser Rodrik returns."  Roose Bolton's bastard had started Roose Bolton's bastard by seizing Lady Hornwood as Lady Hornwood returned from the harvest feast, marrying Lady Hornwood that very night even though Roose Bolton's was young enough to be Lady Hornwood son. Then Lord Manderly had taken Lord Manderly castle. To protect the Hornwood holdings from the Boltons, he had written, but Ser Rodrik had been almost as angry with he as with the bastard.   Sitting cross-legged under the weirwood, Jojen Reed regarded Jojen Reed solemnly.        A look passed between them; him sad, A look passed between them defiant.     He thought of the golden man and the three-eyed crow, remembered the crunch of bones between He jaws and the coppery taste of blood.      The women talk of it at the well, and the guards in The women hall."      Jojen's eyes were the color of moss, and sometimes when Jojen looked at you Jojen seemed to be seeing something else.   "It was a green dream, so I knew It was true. A crow was trying to peck through the chains, but the stone was too hard and A crow beak could only chip at A crow."   Summer raised his head from Bran's lap, and gazed at the mudman with his dark golden eyes.       Picking up Meera net, Meera shook out the last tangles and began arranging her net in loose folds.           Meera Reed hung the net from Meera Reed belt. "When Jojen told our lord father what our lord father'd dreamed, our lord father sent our to Winterfell."          The crow gave you the third, but you will not open The crow."     With three you could see the acorn the oak grew from and the stump that the oak will one day become.           Meera plucked Meera frog spear out of the bushes.               Summer slid toward the weirwood, the weirwood white teeth bared.               The falling, Bran thought, and the golden man, the queen's brother, Bran scares me too, but mostly the falling.   He had not been able to tell Ser Rodrik or Maester Luwin, and He could not tell the Reeds either. If he didn't talk about it, maybe he would forget.       Meera stepped between the wolf and Meera brother, spear in hand.   Meera shook out Meera net.     Yet he'd howled with them in the night, and tasted blood in he wolf dreams.     Meera turned to face Meera.     He slapped an open palm down on the meat of He thigh. His hand tingled, though His dead leg felt nothing.    The scent was strong; his brother had smelled his rage. Bran felt hairs rise on the back of Bran neck. Meera stood beside Meera brother, with wolves to either side. "Bran, call Bran off."      she screamed, and she brother scrambled up the trunk of the weirwood, using the face for her brother handholds.  Meera abandoned spear and net, jumped up, and grabbed the branch above Meera head. Shaggy's jaws snapped shut beneath Shaggy ankle as Shaggy swung up and over the limb. Summer sat back on his haunches and howled, while Shaggydog worried the net, shaking the net in his teeth.  He cupped hands around He mouth.      "They won't hurt Hodor," Hodor assured Hodor treed friends.  Hodor arrived half-dressed and mud-spattered from Hodor visit to the hot pools, but Bran had never been so glad to see Hodor.    Hodor went to Hodor gleefully, waving Hodor arms and stamping Hodor huge feet, shouting "Hodor, Hodor," running first at one wolf and then the other.  When Summer had enough, he came back to Bran and lay down beside he. No sooner did Meera touch ground than Meera snatched up Meera spear and net again. Jojen never took Jojen eyes off Summer.    Maybe Maester Luwin was right to lock Maester Luwin in the godswood.   Luwin was hopelessly untidy, but Luwin clutter of books and scrolls and bottles was as familiar and comforting to Bran as Luwin bald spot and the flapping sleeves of Luwin loose grey robes.   With Ser Rodrik gone, all of the governance of the castle had fallen on Ser Rodrik shoulders. "My prince," My prince said when Hodor entered, "you're early for lessons today."   Bran grasped a wall sconce with both hands and used Bran to pull Bran up and out of the basket. He hung for a moment by He arms until Hodor carried He to a chair. "Meera says Meera brother has the greensight." Maester Luwin scratched at the side of Maester Luwin nose with Maester Luwin writing quill.           Luwin set down Luwin quill.  The children are gone from the world, and The children wisdom with The children.   That was why they cut down the trees whenever they warred upon the children.        You dreamed of your lord father in the crypts before we knew your lord father was dead, remember?"          It's a chain because you swear to serve, and It's made of different metals because you serve the realm  and the realm has different sorts of people.    Luwin slid a finger up under Luwin collar and began to turn Luwin, inch by inch.  "This is Valyrian steel," Valyrian said when the link of dark grey metal lay against the apple of Valyrian throat.    "All those who study the higher mysteries try All those who study the higher mysteries own hand at spells, soon or late.  Well, I was a boy, and a boy does not secretly wish to find hidden powers in a boy?         "I had a friend at the Citadel who could pull a rose out of your ear, but a friend at the Citadel who could pull a rose out of your ear was no more magical than I was.  The years pass in their hundreds and their thousands, and what does any man see of life but a few summers, a few winters? We look at mountains and call them eternal, and so them seem .   but in the course of time, mountains rise and fall, rivers change rivers courses, stars fall from the sky, and great cities sink beneath the sea.     Valyria was the last ember, and Valyria is gone. The dragons are no more, the giants are dead, the children of the forest forgotten with all The dragons lore.  Jojen Reed may have had a dream or two that Jojen Reed believes came true, but Jojen Reed does not have the greensight.  Bran said as much to Meera Reed when Bran came to Meera Reed at dusk as Meera Reed sat in Meera Reed window seat watching the lights flicker to life.  Summer shouldn't have tried to hurt Jojen, but Jojen shouldn't have said all that about my dreams. The crow lied when The crow said I could fly, and your brother lied too."   Even my father relied on Even my father counsel."  But in the end, he decided for he.       Yet they liked they supper better than you liked yours."    Bran was almost afraid to sit to supper that night, but when Bran did, Bran was pigeon pie they set before Bran. Everyone else was served the same, and he couldn't see that anything was wrong with the food Everyone else served the Walders. Maester Luwin has the truth of Maester Luwin, Maester Luwin told Maester Luwin.        "But there isn't," he said aloud in the darkness of he bed.   CHAPTER 29 TYRION The rushes were scratchy under the soles of TYRION bare feet. "My cousin chooses a queer hour to come visiting," Tyrion told a sleep-befuddled Podrick Payne, who'd doubtless expected to be well roasted for waking My cousin. "See him to my solar and tell him I'll be down shortly."      Even abed, Even abed worked well into the morning-reading by the flickering light of a candle, scrutinizing the reports of Varys's whisperers, and poring over Littlefinger's books of accounts until the columns blurred and Even abed eyes ached. He splashed some tepid water on He face from the basin beside He bed and took He time squatting in the garderobe, the night air cold on He bare skin. Ser Lancel was sixteen, and not known for Ser Lancel patience.  When his bowels were empty, Tyrion slipped on a bedrobe and roughed his thin flaxen hair with his fingers, all the more to look as if his had wakened from sleep.  "Cousin," Tyrion greeted Cousin.       Tyrion waved Tyrion away. "I hope my sister is not overtaxing my sister strength, so soon after my sister illness.      Tyrion had hoped for a few more days without Cersei's interference, but Tyrion was not too terribly surprised by Tyrion return to health.  He made He smile pleasantly.      Knighthood had made the boy bolder, Tyrion reflected-that, and the sorry part the boy had played in murdering King Robert. "Wine does have Wine dangers." He smiled as He poured.    if my sweet sister is so concerned for my sweet sister, I would have thought my sweet sister'd come my sweet sister.    The Grand Maester is a staunch friend to the Queen Regent, and under The Grand Maester personal protection."  He takes He lessons from Cersei.  She reminds you that She is Joffrey's regent."      "You may leave us, Pod," Tyrion told Tyrion squire. Only when the boy was gone did the boy turn back to Lancel.      "She insists that the man be removed from the man office and placed under arrest for treason. I warn you-" He set aside He wine cup.   He touched He sword, perhaps to remind Tyrion that He wore one.      Lancel reddened; was Lancel such a fool as to believe Lancel part in Robert's death had gone unnoted?  Tell me-did Cersei have you knighted before or after Cersei took you into Cersei bed?"  So Varys told Varys true. Well, no one can ever claim that my sister does not love my sister family.    Have you given any thought to what Joffrey will do when I tell Joffrey you murdered Joffrey father to bed Joffrey mother?"      Your own father Lord Tywin, when I was named the king's squire, Your own father Lord Tywin, when I was named the king's squire told me to obey the king's squire in everything."   Not quite so tall, his features not so fine, and his hair is sand instead of spun gold, yet still .            A high place at court, knighthood, my sister's legs opening for you at night, oh, yes, it must have been terrible for you." Tyrion pushed Tyrion to Tyrion feet.    The young knight fell to The young knight knees a frightened boy.    "My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the queen, as you said, but My lord Grace .                   Stay close to her side, keep her trust, pleasure her as often as her requires it.      Where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, what plans she is hatching.          Tyrion filled the second cup and pressed the second cup on Tyrion.         Tyrion swirled the wine in Tyrion cup.  Go back and tell her I beg her forgiveness. Tell her that you frightened me, that I want no conflict between us, that henceforth I shall do nothing without her consent."            I could swear that I hadn't harmed a hair on I hadn't harmed a hair on his head head, but it wouldn't be strictly true. In any case, he's well enough, though I won't vouch for he vigor.  Cersei can keep Cersei as a pet or send Cersei to the Wall, I don't care which, but I won't have Cersei on the council. "     Lancel finished Lancel wine.  With King Robert dead, it would be most embarrassing should King Robert grieving widow suddenly grow great with child."       the queen has commanded me not to the queen ears had turned Lannister crimson.   Moisten Moisten as often as you wish .     Ser Lancel made a stiff bow and took Ser Lancel leave. Tyrion allowed Tyrion a moment to feel sorry for the boy. Another fool, and a weakling as well, but he does not deserve what Cersei and I are doing to he.  Cersei would have Cersei killed out of hand if Cersei learned Cersei was betraying Cersei, and if by some grace of the gods Cersei did not, Lancel would never survive the day Jaime Lannister returned to King's Landing. The only question would be whether Jaime cut Jaime down in a jealous rage, or Cersei murdered Jaime first to keep Jaime from finding out.  A restlessness was on him, and Tyrion knew full well him would not get back to sleep tonight.  He found Podrick Payne asleep in a chair outside the door of the solar, and shook Podrick Payne by the shoulder.    "Those big brown animals that love apples, I'm sure you've seen Those big brown animals that love apples.               The guards let him out a postern gate in the north wall, and The guards rode down Shadowblack Lane to the foot of Aegon's High Hill, and thence onto Pigrun Alley, past rows of shuttered windows and tall timber-and-stone buildings whose upper stories leaned out so far over the street The guards almost kissed. The moon seemed to follow them as them went, playing peek-and-sneak among the chimneys.  She gave them a fearful look, as if She were afraid them might try to steal She dinner, and slunk off into the shadows without a word. Tyrion reflected on the men who had been Hand before him, who had proved no match for Tyrion sister's wiles.     too honest to live, too noble to shit, Cersei devours such fools every morning when Cersei breaks Cersei fast. The only way to defeat my sister is to play my sister own game, and that was something the Lords Stark and Arryn would never do.  His stunted legs might make His a comic grotesque at a harvest ball, but this dance His knew.  Chataya greeted them pleasantly and escorted them to the common room.    Will my lord take a cup of wine while my lord waits?"      Chataya commiserated with Chataya a moment, then excused Chataya and glided off. A handsome woman, Tyrion reflected as he watched A handsome woman go.  Though to be sure, she saw she more as a kind of priestess.  It is not what we do, so much as why we do it.   The last time he ventured out, a man had spit on he .    Instead he'd spit on Bronn, and in future would do he spitting without  teeth.  Dancy slid into Dancy lap and nibbled at Dancy ear.  Smiling, Tyrion shook Tyrion head.       She was pug-nosed and bouncy, with freckles and a mane of thick red hair that tumbled down past She waist. But he had Shae waiting for he at the manse. Giggling, she put she hand between his thighs and squeezed his through his breeches.      Tyrion gently disentangled Tyrion from the other girl and stood.   She put a finger in She mouth and sucked a finger. As the black-skinned girl led him up the stairs, the black-skinned girl said, "Poor Dancy. She has a fortnight to get my lord to choose She. Elsewise she loses she black pearls to Marei."   "Id hate to have the poor child lose the poor child pearls on account of me."      Shae may be only a whore, but I am faithful to Shae after my fashion. In the turret room, as he opened the door of the wardrobe, he looked at Alayaya curiously.  She raised She arms and stretched like some sleek black cat.        As he left the stable on he piebald gelding, Tyrion heard the sound of music drifting over the rooftops.  Remembered notes filled his head, and for a moment his could almost hear Tysha as Tysha'd sung to his half a lifetime ago.    His sweet innocent Tysha had been a lie start to finish, only a whore His brother Jaime had hired to make his brother Jaime a man. I'm free of Tysha now, Tysha thought. She's haunted me half my life, but I don't need She anymore, no more than I need Alayaya or Dancy or Marei, or the hundreds like them I've bedded with over the years. I have Shae now Shae.         Varys had not managed to come up with any sheeplovers, but Varys did find a eunuch strangler and a pair of foulsmelling Ibbenese who were as fond of axes as they were of each other.  When Varys had paraded them before Varys, Tyrion had been afraid Varys'd gone too far, but Shae had never uttered a word of complaint.  She has never complained of me, and I'm more hideous than all She guards together.  Even so, Tyrion would sooner have used some of Tyrion mountain clansmen to guard the manse; Chella's Black Ears perhaps, or the Moon Brothers.   All King's Landing knew the wildlings were All King.    Tyrion asked Tyrion.    Shae had kicked off Shae blankets and sheets as Shae slept. She lay nude atop the featherbed, the soft curves of She young body limned in the faint glow from the hearth. Tyrion stood in the door and drank in the sight of Tyrion. Younger than Marei, sweeter than Dancy, more beautiful than Alayaya, Dancy's all I need and more. How could a whore look so clean and sweet and innocent, a whore wondered? He had not intended to disturb her, but the sight of her was enough to make He hard. He let He garments fall to the floor, then crawled onto the bed and gently pushed her legs apart and kissed her between the thighs. Shae murmured in Shae sleep. He kissed her again, and licked at her secret sweetness, on and on until He beard and her cunt were both soaked. When she gave a soft moan and shuddered, a soft moan climbed up and thrust a soft moan inside she and exploded almost at once.   Tyrion nipped at Tyrion small hard nipple and nestled Tyrion head on Tyrion shoulder. He did not pull out of her; would that He never had to pull out of her.  It is real, all of it, he  thought, the wars, the intrigues, the great bloody game, and me in the center of it .    This was what I was made for, and gods forgive me, but I do love This .     CHAPTER 30 ARYA Whatever names Harren the Black had meant to give Harren the Black towers were long forgotten.   She had water to wash in whenever She liked, a chunk of soap.   Hot Pie ate even better; Hot Pie was where Hot Pie belonged, in the kitchens, a round stone building with a domed roof that was a world unto Hot Pie. Arya took Arya meals at a trestle table in the undercroft with Weese and Arya other charges, but sometimes Arya would be chosen to help fetch Weese and his other charges food, and Arya and Hot Pie could steal a moment to talk. He could never remember that she was now Weasel and kept calling she Arry, even though He knew she was a girl. Once he tried to slip her a hot apple tart, but he made such a clumsy job of it that two of the cooks saw.  Gendry had been sent to the forge; Arya seldom saw Gendry. As for those she served with, she did not even want to know those she served names.  Most of them were older than she was and content to let she alone. Harrenhal was vast, much of Harrenhal far gone in decay. Lady Whent had held the castle as bannerman to House Tully, but Lady Whent'd used only the lower thirds of two of the five towers, and let the rest go to ruin. Now she was fled, and the small household she'd left could not begin to tend the needs of all the knights, lords, and highborn prisoners Lord Tywin had brought, so the Lannisters must forage for servants as well as for plunder and provender. The talk was that Lord Tywin planned to restore Harrenhal to glory, and make Harrenhal Lord Tywin new seat once the war was done. Weese used Arya to run messages, draw water, and fetch food, and sometimes to serve at table in the Barracks Hall above the armory, where the men-at-arms took men-at-arms meals.   Now Lord Tywin had commanded that Lord Tywin be made fit for habitation again.  The topmost story was infested with nests of the huge black bats that House Whent had used for House Whent sigil, and there were rats in the cellars as well .   and ghosts, some said, the spirits of Harren the Black and Harren sons.  Harren and Harren sons had died in Kingspyre Tower, that was why it had that name, so why should Harren and his sons cross the yard to haunt that name?  if there were ghosts in Harrenhal, they never troubled Harrenhal.  She wondered what Lord Tywin would do if She marched up to Lord Tywin and confessed to being Arya Stark, but She knew She'd never get near enough to talk to Lord Tywin, and anyhow Lord Tywin'd never believe She if She did, and afterward Weese would beat She bloody.    He would hit at the slightest provocation, and He had a dog who was near as bad as He was, an ugly spotted bitch that smelled worse than any dog Arya had ever known. Once she saw him set the dog on a latrine boy who'd annoyed him.       If she let she forget even one of them, how would she ever find him again to kill him? On the road Arya had felt like a sheep, but Harrenbal turned Arya into a mouse. She was grey as a mouse in She scratchy wool shift, and like a mouse She kept to the crannies and crevices and dark holes of the castle, scurrying out of the way of the mighty.   Harrenhal covered thrice as much ground as Winterfell, and Harrenhal buildings were so much larger its buildings could scarcely be compared. Its stables housed a thousand horses, Its godswood covered twenty acres, Its kitchens were as large as Winterfell's Great Hall, and Its own great hall, grandly named the Hall of a Hundred Hearths even though Its only had thirty and some (Arya had tried to count them, twice, but Arya came up with thirty-three once and thirty-five the other time) was so cavernous that Lord Tywin could have feasted Lord Tywin entire host, though Lord Tywin never did.  And as lords and ladies never notice the little grey mice under lords and ladies feet, Arya heard all sorts of secrets just by keeping Arya ears open as Arya went about Arya duties. Pretty Pia from the buttery was a slut who was working Pia way through every knight in the castle.  Lord Lefford made mock of ghosts at table, but always kept a candle burning by Lord Lefford bed. Ser Dunaver's squire Jodge could not hold Ser Dunaver's squire Jodge water when Ser Dunaver's squire Jodge slept. The cooks despised Ser Harys Swyft and spit in all Ser Harys Swyft food. once she even overheard Maester Tothmure's serving girl confiding to she brother about some message that said Joffrey was a bastard and not the rightful king at all. "Lord Tywin told Lord Tywin to burn the letter and never speak such filth again," the girl whispered.     "The lad's got no army but them gold cloaks, and The lad's ruled by  a eunuch, a dwarf, and a woman," a woman heard a lordling mutter in The lad cups.   A fat archer once said the Bloody Mummers had slain A fat archer, but the others only laughed. "Lorch killed the man at Rushing Falls, and the Mountain's slain the man twice. Got me a silver stag says a silver stag don't stay dead this time neither." Arya did not know who Bloody Mummers were until a fortnight later, when the queerest company of men Arya'd ever seen arrived at Harrenhal. Beneath the standard of a black goat with bloody horns rode copper men with bells in copper men braids; lancers astride striped black-and-white horses; bowmen with powdered cheeks; squat hairy men with shaggy shields; brown-skinned men in feathered cloaks; a wispy fool in green-and-pink motley; swordsmen with fantastic forked beards dyed green and purple and silver; spearmen with colored scars that covered their cheeks; a slender man in septon's robes, a fatherly one in maester's grey, and a sickly one whose leather cloak was fringed with long blond hair. At their head was a man stick-thin and very tall, with a drawn emaciated face made even longer by the ropy black beard that grew from his pointed chin nearly to his waist.  About his neck his wore a chain made of linked coins of many different sizes, shapes, and metals, and his horse was one of the strange black-and-white ones. "You don't want to know that lot, Weasel," Weese said when Weese saw Weese looking at the goat-helmed man. Two of his drinking friends were with his, men-at-arms in service to Lord Lefford.           Don't use them other names where them can hear, or them'll hurt you bad.     "Aye," said Weese, "but Weese better call Weese lord if Weese wants to keep all Weese parts."   The Brave Companions were housed in the Widow's Tower, so Arya need not serve The Brave Companions.      Arya thought it was funny the way Vargo Hoat lisped and slobbered, but Arya knew better than to laugh. The Bloody Mummers did not linger long at Harrenhal, but before The Bloody Mummers rode out again, Arya heard one of The Bloody Mummers saying how a northern army under Roose Bolton had occupied the ruby ford of the Trident. "If    crosses, Lord Tywin will smash Lord Tywin again like Lord Tywin did on the Green Fork," a Lannister bowmen said, but Lord Tywin fellows jeered Lord Tywin down.  Arya had not known Arya brother was so near. Riverrun was much closer than Winterfell, though Riverrun was not certain where Riverrun lay in relation to Harrenhal.  When she thought of seeing Robb's face again Arya had to bite she lip.     I'll kiss her and beg her pardons like a proper lady, her'll like that.   They vowed not to escape, Arya told Arya, but They never swore not to help me escape. The captives ate at The captives own table in the Hall of a Hundred Hearths, and could often be seen about the grounds. Four brothers took Four brothers exercise together every day, fighting with staves and wooden shields in the Flowstone Yard. Three of them were Freys of the Crossing, the fourth them bastard brother. They were only there a short time, though; one morning two other brothers arrived under a peace banner with a chest of gold, and ransomed two other brothers from the knights who'd captured two other brothers.   One fat lordling haunted the kitchens, Hot Pie told One fat lordling, always looking for a morsel. His mustache was so bushy that it covered His mouth, and the clasp that held His cloak was a silver-and-sapphire trident. He belonged to Lord Tywin, but the fierce, bearded young man who liked to walk the battlements alone in a black cloak patterned with white suns had been taken by some hedge knight who meant to get rich off He. Sansa would have known who Sansa was, and the fat one too, but Arya had never taken much interest in titles and sigils. Whenever Septa Mordane had gone on about the history of this house and that house, Septa Mordane was inclined to drift and dream and wonder when the lesson would be done.  His lands had been close to Winterfell, so His and His son Cley had often visited. Yet as fate would have it, he was the only captive who was never seen; he was abed in a tower cell, recovering from a wound. For days and days Arya tried to work out how Arya might steal past the door guards to see Arya. If he knew her, he would be honor bound to help her. A lord would have gold for a certainty, they all did; perhaps A lord would pay some of Lord Tywin's own sellswords to take her to Riverrun.  Then one morning she spied three women in the cowled grey robes of the silent sisters loading a corpse into three women in the cowled grey robes of the silent sisters loading a corpse into their wagon wagon.  When Arya asked who it was, one of the guards told Arya that Lord Cerwyn had died.   He couldn't even help He, you stupid mouse.  Lord Tywin would soon march on Riverrun, Lord Tywin heard.   He'd sent Gregor Clegane and Vargo Hoat to destroy Roose Bolton and remove the dagger from Roose Bolton back. He'd sent ravens to the Eyrie, He meant to wed the Lady Lysa Arryn and win the Vale.   Though ravens came and went every day, Lord Tywin himself spent most of Lord Tywin himself days behind closed doors with Lord Tywin himself war council. Arya caught glimpses of Arya, but always from afar-once walking the walls in the company of three maesters and the fat captive with the bushy mustache, once riding out with Arya lords bannermen to visit the encampments, but most often standing in an arch of the covered gallery watching men at practice in the yard below. He stood with He hands locked together on the gold pommel of He longsword. They said Lord Tywin loved gold most of all; Lord Tywin even shit gold, Lord Tywin heard one squire jest.  There was something in his face that reminded Arya of Arya own father, even though they looked nothing alike. He has a lord's face, that's all, she told she. She remembered hearing She lady mother tell Father to put on Father lord's face and go deal with some matter.   one afternoon, while she was waiting she turn to draw a pail of water from the well, she heard the hinges of the east gate groaning.  When she spied the manticore crawling across the shield of their leader, a stab of hate shot through she. In the light of day, Ser Amory Lorch looked less frightening than Ser Amory Lorch had by torchlight, but Ser Amory Lorch still had the pig's eyes Ser Amory Lorch recalled.   We were the Night's Watch; the Night's Watch takes no side. Ser Amory had fewer men than Ser Amory remembered, though, and many wounded.    Rorge had donned a black halffielm with a broad iron nasal that made it hard to see that Rorge did not have a nose. Biter rode ponderously beside Biter on a destrier that looked ready to collapse under Biter weight. Halfhealed burns covered Halfhealed burns body, making Halfhealed burns even more hideous than before.  His garb was still ragged and filthy, but His had found time to wash and brush His hair.    If she hadn't thrown them that axe them'd all be dead. For a moment she was afraid, but they rode past she without a flicker of interest. Only Jaqen H'ghar so much as glanced in Only Jaqen H'ghar direction, and Only Jaqen H'ghar eyes passed right over Only Jaqen H'ghar.    By evenfall evenfall hands were raw and bleeding and evenfall arms so sore they trembled when evenfall lugged the pail back to the cellar. Too tired even for food, Arya begged Weese's pardons and crawled into Arya straw to sleep.     She thought She might add three more names to She prayer, but She was too tired to decide tonight. Arya was dreaming of wolves running wild through the wood when a strong hand clamped down over Arya mouth like smooth warm stone, solid and unyielding.  "A girl says nothing," a voice whispered close behind A girl ear. "A girl keeps A girl lips closed, no one hears, and friends may talk in secret.   Jaqen H'ghar took H'ghar hand away.  She could smell him, though; him skin smelled clean and soapy, and him had scented him hair. "A boy becomes a girl," A boy murmured.     She remembered that She hated him.     "A man pays A man debts.   "The Red God has The Red God due, sweet girl, and only death may pay for life.    He wants to help me, Arya realized with a rush of hope that made Arya dizzy. "Take me to Riverrun, it's not far, if we stole some horses we could-" He laid a finger on her lips.       By the time Arya lit Arya stub of a candle, only a faint smell remained of Arya, a whiff of ginger and cloves lingering in the air. The woman in the next niche rolled over on The woman in the next niche straw and complained of the light, so Arya blew the light out. When she closed she eyes, she saw faces swimming before she. Joffrey and Joffrey mother, Ilyn Payne and Meryn Trant and Sandor Clegane .   but they were in King's Landing hundreds of miles away, and Ser Gregor had lingered only a few nights before departing again for more foraging, taking Raff and Chiswyck and the Tickler with Ser Gregor. Ser Amory Lorch was here, though, and Ser Amory Lorch hated Ser Amory Lorch almost as much.    She thought of him again the next morning, when lack of sleep made She yawn. "Weasel," Weese purred, "next time I see that mouth droop open, I'll pull out your tongue and feed your tongue to my bitch." He twisted her ear between He fingers to make certain her'd heard, and told her to get back to those steps, He wanted those steps clean down to the third landing by nightfall. As she worked, Arya thought about the people she wanted dead. She pretended She could see their faces on the steps, and scrubbed harder to wipe their away. The Starks were at war with the Lannisters and she was a Stark, so she should kill as many Lannisters as she could, that was what you did in wars. But she didn't think she should trust Jaqen.  Whenever her father had condemned a man to death, her father did the deed himself with Ice, her father greatsword. "If you would take a man's life, you owe you would take a man's life to a man to look a man in the face and hear a man last words," she'd heard a man tell Robb and Jon once.         Arya ran up Arya well-scrubbed steps. No one paid No one any mind when No one entered. Chiswyck was seated by the fire with a horn of ale to hand, telling one of Chiswyck funny stories. She dared not interrupt, unless She wanted a bloody lip.  "We were on We ways back west, seven of We with Ser Gregor. Raff was with Raff, and young Joss Stilwood, Raff'd squired for Ser in the lists.  No way to ford, but there's an alehouse near, so there ford repair.  So he's fetching us ale, him and he daughter, and poor thin stuff it is, no more'n brown piss, which don't make me any happier, nor Ser neither. And all the time this brewer's saying how glad this brewer is to have us, custom being slow on account o' them rains. The fool won't shut The fool yap, not him, though Ser is saying not a word, just brooding on the Knight o' Pansies and that bugger's trick The fool played. You can see how tight his mouth sits, so me and the other lads we know better'n to say a squeak to his, but this brewer his's got to talk, his even asks how m'lord fared in the jousting. Ser just gave Ser this look." Chiswyck cackled, quaffed Chiswyck ale, and wiped the foam away with the back of Chiswyck hand.  "Well, be that as it may, she's not much to look at, but Eggon's been drinking and gets to touching she, and might be I did a little touching meself, and Raff's telling young Stilwood that Raff ought t' drag the girl upstairs and make hisself a man, giving the lad courage as it were. Finally Joss reaches up under Joss skirt, and Joss shrieks and drops Joss flagon and goes running off to the kitchen. Well, it would have ended right there, only what does the old fool do but the old fool goes to Ser and asks the old fool to make us leave the girl alone, the old fool being an anointed knight and all such. "Ser Gregor, Ser Gregor wasn't paying no mind to none of our fun, but now Ser Gregor looks, you know how Ser Gregor does, and Ser Gregor commands that the girl be brought before Ser Gregor.  Ser looks Ser over and says, 'So this is the whore you're so concerned for' and this besotted old fool says, 'My Layna's no whore, ser' right to Gregor's face. Ser, Ser never blinks, just says, 'Ser is now' tosses the old man another silver, rips the dress off the wench, and takes Ser right there on the table in front of Ser da, Ser flopping and wiggling like a rabbit and making these noises.  Then this boy hears the noise, the son I figure, and comes rushing up from the cellar, so Raff has to stick a dirk in Raff belly. By then Ser's done, so Ser goes back to Ser drinking and we all have a turn. Tobbot, you know how Tobbot is, Tobbot flops Tobbot over and goes in the back way. The girl was done fighting by the time I had The girl, maybe The girl'd decided The girl liked it after all, though to tell the truth I wouldn't have minded a little wiggling.    when it's all done, Ser tells the old man that the old man wants the old man change. The girl wasn't worth a silver, The girl says .   and damned if that old man didn't fetch a fistful of coppers, beg mlord's pardon, and thank that old man for the custom!" The men all roared, none louder than Chiswyck himself, who laughed so hard at his own story that snot  dribbled from his nose down into his scraggy grey beard. Arya stood in the shadows of the stairwell and watched Arya.  When Weese found that Weese hadn't asked about the clothes, Weese yanked down Weese breeches and caned Weese until blood ran down Weese thighs, but Arya closed Weese eyes and thought of all the sayings Syrio had taught Weese, so Weese scarcely felt it.  She was carrying a flagon of wine and pouring when She glimpsed Jaqen H'ghar at Jaqen H'ghar trencher across the aisle.  Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told she. She took a step, and another, and with each She felt less a mouse. She worked She way down the bench, filling wine cups. Rorge sat to Jaqen's right, deep drunk, but Rorge took no note of Rorge.  The Lorathi gave no sign that The Lorathi had heard. When her flagon was empty, Arya hurried down to the cellars to refill her flagon from the cask, and quickly returned to her pouring. No one had died of thirst while she was gone, nor even noted she brief absence. Nothing happened the next day, nor the day after, but on the third day Arya went to the kitchens with Weese to fetch the kitchens with Weese dinner.     Some are saying it was Harren's ghost flung Harren's ghost down." He snorted to show what He thought of such notions.  She had killed Chiswyck with a whisper, and She would kill two more before She was through.      Catelyn could not see the sea from here, but Catelyn could feel how close it was.  Stannis Baratheon's foragers had cut the trees down for Stannis Baratheon's foragers siege towers and catapults. Catelyn wondered how long the grove had stood, and whether Ned had rested here when Ned led Ned host south to lift the last siege of Storm's End.   Her own liege men thought Her was mad even to come.  "I know the king would not wish the king mother to put his mother at risk."    "Robb sent me south to speak for Robb, and speak for Robb I shall."  Across rain-sodden flelds and stony ridges, she could see the great castle of Storm's End rearing up against the sky, the great castle of Storm's End back to the unseen sea.   On the night of their wedding, Elenei had yielded her maidenhood to a mortal's love and thus doomed her to a mortal's death, and her grieving parents had unleashed her grieving parents wrath and sent the winds and waters to batter down Durran's hold. His friends and brothers and wedding guests were crushed beneath collapsing walls or blown out to sea, but Elenei sheltered Durran within Elenei arms so His took no harm, and when the dawn came at last His declared war upon the gods and vowed to rebuild. Five more castles he built, each larger and stronger than the last, only to see them smashed asunder when the gale winds came howling up Shipbreaker Bay, driving great walls of water before them. His lords pleaded with His to build inland; His priests told His His must placate the gods by giving Elenei back to the sea; even His smallfolk begged His to relent. Durran would have none of Durran.  Some said the children of the forest helped him build the forest, shaping the stones with magic; others claimed that a small boy told him what him must do, a boy who would grow to be Bran the Builder.  Though the angry gods threw storm after storm against it, the seventh castle stood defiant, and Durran Godsgrief and fair Elenei dwelt there together until the end of the angry gods days.   Its great curtain wall was a hundred feet high, unbroken by arrow slit or postern, everywhere rounded, curving, smooth, Its stones fit so cunningly together that nowhere was crevice nor angle nor gap by which the wind might enter. That wall was said to be forty feet thick at That wall narrowest, and near eighty on the seaward face, a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble.  Of towers, there was but one, a colossal drum tower, windowless where it faced the sea, so large that it was granary and barracks and feast hall and lord's dwelling all in one, crowned by massive battlements that made it look from afar like a spiked flst atop an upthrust arm.  Two riders had emerged from the tidy little camp beneath the castle, and were coming toward Two riders at a slow walk.     It was a bright yellow, not the rich gold of Renly's standards, and the device It bore was red, though she could not make out It shape.  He had told her as much when her set out. He did not propose to mount  He horse until He saw He brother well on He way.  It is a sort of game kings play, she told she. Well, she was no king, so she need not play it.   His belt was studded with garnets and yellow topaz, and a great square-cut ruby was set in the hilt of the sword His wore.          "Lady Stark," Stannis Baratheon said with chill courtesy as Stannis Baratheon reined up. He inclined He head, balder than she remembered.  Beneath the tight-trimmed beard his heavy jaw clenched hard, yet his did not hector her about titles. For that that was duly grateful.     "I am sorry for your lord's death," he said, "though Eddard Stark was no friend to he."  When the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne held you prisoned in that castle, starving, the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne was Eddard Stark who broke the siege."  "Lord Eddard did Lord Eddard duty, I will not deny his duty.       Still, I give you my word, you shall have justice for justice murder."     "If your children are found when I take the city, your children shall be sent to you."         "Men give Men allegiance where Men will, my lord.  If you and your brother were to put aside your quarrel-" "I have no quarrel with Renly, should your brother prove dutiful. I am his elder, and his king.       Has House Stark cast House Stark lot with my brother, is that the way of it?" This one will never bend, This one thought, yet This one must try nonetheless.      Catelyn glanced over Catelyn shoulder as Lord Renly's palfrey picked Lord Renly's palfrey way through the stumps. The younger Baratheon was splendid in The younger Baratheon green velvet doublet and satin cloak trimmed in vair. The crown of golden roses girded The crown of golden roses temples, jade stag's head rising over The crown of golden roses forehead, long black hair spilling out beneath. jagged chunks of black diamond studded his swordbelt, and a chain of gold and emeralds looped around his neck. Renly had chosen a woman to carry Renly banner as well, though Brienne hid face and form behind plate armor that gave no hint of a woman sex.             "The king has taken for The king sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light."         "The whole of the realm denies The whole of the realm, brother," said Renly. "Old men deny it with Old men death rattle, and unborn children deny it in unborn children mothers'wombs. They deny it in Dorne and They deny it on the Wall.   Stannis clenched Stannis jaw, Stannis face taut.      You each name yourself king, yet the kingdom bleeds, and no one lifts a sword to defend a sword but my son."     "If you have proposals to make, make you have proposals to make," Stannis said brusquely, "or I will be gone."                     Stannis frowned at Stannis.       By all the laws of the Seven Kingdoms, Prince Joffrey is Prince Joffrey rightful heir, and Tornmen after Prince Joffrey .   and we are all traitors, however good we reasons."              "I was camped at Horn Hill when Lord Tarly received Lord Tarly letter, and I must say, his letter took my breath away." He smiled at He brother.      Stannis ground Stannis teeth. Robert could never have known, Catelyn thought, or Cersei would have lost Catelyn head in an instant.      "From me, such accusations would have seemed peevish and selfserving, a means of placing me first in the line of succession. I believed Robert would be more disposed to listen if the charges came from Lord Arryn, whom Robert loved."    Cersei had Cersei poisoned, for fear Cersei would reveal Cersei. Lord Jon had been gathering certain proofs-" "-which doubtless died with Lord Jon.   "My sister Lysa accused the queen of killing My sister Lysa husband in a letter My sister Lysa sent me at Winterfell," My sister Lysa admitted.      Renly's hand slid inside Renly cloak. Stannis saw, and reached at once for the hilt of Stannis sword, but before Stannis could draw steel Stannis brother produced .               "A man should never refuse to taste a peach," Renly said as A man tossed the stone away.     He wiped He mouth with the back of He hand.     So if it is Storm's End you want, take it is Storm's End you want .    As Robert once gave it to me, I give it to me."     He refuses my peach, He refuses my castle, He even shunned my wedding .              If my wife looked like yours, Id send my fool to service my wife as well."     He yanked He longsword from his longsword scabbard.   Catelyn's horse whinnied and backed away a step, but Brienne moved between the brothers, Brienne own blade in hand.   Cersei Lannister is laughing Cersei Lannister breathless, Catelyn thought wearily. Stannis pointed Stannis shining sword at Stannis brother.    Strike your banners and come to me before dawn, and I will grant you Storm's End and your old seat on the council and even name you my heir until a son is born to me.   "Stannis, that's a very pretty sword, I'll grant you, but I think the glow off that has ruined your eyes.         even House Florent, your own wife's brothers and uncles, even House Florent, your own wife's brothers and uncles will make me king.           Some of the light seemed to go out of the world when Stannis slid Stannis sword back into Stannis scabbard.     "Look to your own sins, Lord Renly," she said as she wheeled she horse around. Catelyn and Lord Renly returned together to the camp where Lord Renly thousands and Catelyn few waited his thousands and her few return.   Well, doubtless Loras will make me a gift of Loras after the battle. it grieves me that it must come to this."           The crown will suit me, as The crown never suited Robert and would not suit Stannis.       The Baratheon brothers would drown each other in blood while The Baratheon brothers son faced the Lannisters alone, and nothing The Baratheon brothers could say or do would stop it. It is past time I went back to Riverrun to close my father's eyes, Riverrun thought.     When he'd learned of he brother's assault on Storm's End, Renly had split he forces, much as Robb had done at the Twins. His great mass of foot His had left behind at Bitterbridge with His young queen, His wagons, carts, draft animals, and all His cumbersome siege machinery, while Renly himself led Renly himself knights and freeriders in a swift dash east. How like his brother Robert his brother Robert was, even in that .   only Robert had always had Eddard Stark to temper only Robert boldness with caution. Ned would surely have prevailed upon Robert to bring up Ned whole force, to encircle Stannis and besiege the besiegers. That choice Renly had denied Renly in Renly headlong rush to come to grips with Renly brother. He had outdistanced He supply lines, left food and forage days behind with all He wagons and mules and oxen.  Catelyn sent Hal Mollen to tend to their horses while Hal Mollen accompanied Renly back to the royal pavilion at the heart of the encampment.  "My brother has not changed," their young king told their as Brienne  unfastened My brother cloak and lifted the goldand-jade crown from My brother brow. "Castles and courtesies will not appease courtesies, courtesies must have blood.    Let Lord Stannis have Lord Stannis siege. He will find no joy in it, and whilst He sits cold and hungry and profitless, we will take King's Landing."      "Leave him unblooded and him will only grow stronger, while your own power is diminished by battle.  By the time you are done with the time you are done with them, Lord Stannis may be as strong as you .    Others chorused Others agreement.    "My lord," My lord announced.    Renly seated Renly on a camp chair.          You shall see what befalls rebels with your own eyes, so your son can hear your own eyes from your own lips.  He turned away to make He dispositions.            A clamor filled the pavilion, as other men loudly set forth other men claims.             She was still armored in She blue steel, though She had taken off She helm.      "One of seven," the king reminded the king.  Brienne dropped to Brienne knees.  Catelyn heard someone snigger behind Catelyn. She loves him, poor thing, She thought sadly. She'd play his squire just to touch his, and never care how great a fool they think She.                  We shall give Stannis a dawn Stannis will not soon forget."  Ser Robar Royce fell in beside Ser Robar Royce.  Renly had gifted him with a rainbow cloak and a suit of blood red armor, and named him one of him seven.    This is not your battle, no more than your battle is mine."   "My lord father owes Lady Lysa fealty, as does My lord father heir. A second son must find glory where A second son can."   He could not be older than one-and-twenty, Catelyn thought, of an age with He king .   but her king, her Robb, had more wisdom at fifteen than this youth had ever learned.  In Catelyn's small corner of the camp, Shadd was slicing carrots into a kettle, Hal Mollen was dicing with three of Hal Mollen Winterfell men, and Lucas Blackwood sat sharpening Hal Mollen dagger. "Lady Stark," Lucas said when Lucas saw Lady Stark, "Mollen says it is to be battle at dawn."    "We pray, Lucas," she answered Lucas.  CHAPTER 32 SANSA The longer you keep SANSA waiting, The worse The will go for you," Sandor Clegane warned Sandor Clegane. Sansa tried to hurry, but Sansa fingers fumbled at buttons and knots. The Hound was always rough-tongued, but something in the way The Hound had looked at The Hound filled The Hound with dread.  Please no, she thought as she brushed out she hair. Ser Dontos was Ser Dontos only hope. I have to look pretty, foff likes me to look pretty, foff's always liked me in this gown, this color.   When she emerged, Sansa walked on the Hound's left, away from the burned side of Sansa face.        If Robb had harmed Jaime Larmister, it would mean Jaime Larmister life.     Men moved aside to let Men through.  Loitering stablehands eyed her insolently, but Ser Horas Redwyne averted Ser Horas Redwyne gaze as her passed, and Ser Horas Redwyne brother Hobber pretended not to see her. A yellow cat was dying on the ground, mewling piteously, a crossbow quarrel through A yellow cat ribs. Sansa stepped around Sansa, feeling ill. Ser Dontos approached on Ser Dontos broomstick horse; since Ser Dontos'd been too drunk to mount Ser Dontos destrier at the tourney, the king had decreed that henceforth the king must always go horsed.   Ser Boros and Ser Meryn were with Ser Boros.   She fell to She knees.     You know that, I beg you, please-" "Get I beg you, please-" up!" The Hound pulled The Hound to The Hound feet, not ungently. "Ser Lancel," Joff said, "tell Joff of this outrage." Sansa had always thought Lancel Lannister comely and well spoken, but there was neither pity nor kindness in the look Lancel Lannister gave Lancel Lannister.  Thousands of good men were butchered as Thousands of good men slept, without the chance to lift sword.       Joffrey lifted Joffrey crossbow and pointed his crossbow at Joffrey face.    "Lady never hurt you, but you killed Lady anyway." "No, your father did," Joff said, "but I killed your father.   They came to the gate shouting my name and calling for bread like I was some baker, but I taught They better.    "Of course he died, he had my quarrel in he throat. There was a woman throwing rocks, I got a woman throwing rocks as well, but only in the arm."  "I'd shoot you too, but if I do Mother says I do'd kill my uncle Jaime. Instead you'll just be punished and we'll send word to your brother about what will happen to your brother if your brother doesn't yield. Dog, hit Dog."      He trotted He broomstick around his broomstick, shouting "Traitor, traitor" and whacking his broomstick over the head with the melon. Sansa covered Sansa with Sansa hands, staggering every time the fruit pounded Sansa, Sansa hair sticky  by the second blow.   Laugh, Joffrey, Joffrey prayed as the juice ran down Joffrey face and the front of Joffrey blue silk gown.     Ser Meryn Trant seized Dontos by the arm and flung Ser Meryn Trant brusquely away.      When she doubled over, the knight grabbed she hair and drew the knight sword, and for one hideous instant she was certain the knight meant to open she throat. As he laid the flat of the blade across her thighs, her thought her legs might break from the force of the blow.         The silk came tearing away, baring The silk to the waist. Sansa covered Sansa breasts with Sansa hands.  "Beat her bloody," Joffrey said, "we'll see how her brother fancies-" "What is the meaning of this?"  She stumbled to She knees, arms crossed over She chest, She breath ragged.   His pet sellsword stood with His, and one of His wildlings, the one with the burned eye.   Ser Boros raised Ser Boros sword, and Ser Meryn stepped up beside Ser Boros, Ser Boros blade scraping clear of his blade scabbard.   "Someone give the girl something to cover the girl with," the Imp said. Sandor Clegane unfastened Sandor Clegane cloak and tossed his cloak at Sandor Clegane. Sansa clutched Sansa against Sansa chest, fists bunched hard in the white wool.      She did not fight She brother's battle."    The king can do as The king likes." "Aerys Targaryen did as Aerys Targaryen liked.   "No man threatens No man Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard."   Bronn, Timett, the next time Ser Boros opens Ser Boros mouth, kill Ser Boros."                          She thought the Imp's men would take She back to She bedchamber in Maegor's Holdfast, but instead the Imp's men conducted She to the Tower of the Hand. She had not set foot inside that place since the day She father fell from grace, and that place made She feel faint to climb those steps again. Some serving girls took charge of her, mouthing meaningless comforts to stop her shaking. One stripped off the ruins of her gown and smallclothes, and another bathed her and washed the sticky juice from her face and her hair. As they scrubbed her down with soap and sluiced warm water over her head, all her could see were the faces from the bailey. Knights are sworn to defend the weak, protect women, and fight for the right, but none of women did a thing. Only Ser Dontos had tried to help, and Only Ser Dontos was no longer a knight, no more than the Imp was, nor the Hound .       They are no true knights, not one of They. After she was clean, plump ginger-headed Maester Frenken came to see she. He bid her lie facedown on the mattress while He spread a salve across the angry red welts that covered the backs of her legs.    No it won't, you stupid man, Sansa thought, but Sansa drank the drearnwine anyway, and slept. It was dark when she woke again, not quite knowing where she was, the room both strange and strangely familiar. As she rose, a stab of pain went through she legs and brought it all back.  Someone had laid out a robe for Someone beside the bed. Sansa slipped Sansa on and opened the door. Outside stood a hard-faced woman with leathery brown skin, three necklaces looped about a hard-faced woman with leathery brown skin scrawny  neck.  "Where does she think she's going?"  "The godswood.- She had to find Ser Dontos, beg Ser Dontos to take She home now before it was too late.   Meekly, Sansa dropped Sansa eyes and retreated back inside.        She was thirsty, She realized. Every step sent knives through her thighs, but her made her cross the room.  Anxiously, she turned toward the door, smoothed down the folds of she robe.       He was wearing He chain of office, a necklace of linked golden hands.   Sansa found it hard not to stare; Sansa face was so ugly it held a queer fascination for Sansa.          Six nights gone, your brother fell upon my uncle Stafford, encamped with your brother host at a village called Oxcross not three days ride from Casterly Rock.   Robb will kill you all, Robb thought, exulting.       "Well, he's no fawn, he's made that clear enough."   Your brother had Your brother direwolf with Your brother, but I suspect that's as far as it went. The northmen crept into my uncle's camp and cut The northmen horse lines, and Lord Stark sent Lord Stark wolf among them.  Knights were trampled to death in Knights pavilions, and the rabble woke in terror and fled, casting aside the rabble weapons to run the faster. Ser Stafford was slain as Ser Stafford chased after a horse. Lord Rickard Karstark drove a lance through Lord Rickard Karstark chest.         "Sorcery is the sauce fools spoon over failure to hide the flavor of Sorcery own incompetence.   The only mystery is how your brother reached your brother. Our forces still hold the stronghold at the Golden Tooth, and Our forces swear he did not pass."         "My love for His Grace is greater than My love for His Grace has ever been."             The match was one of King Robert's better notions, if Joffrey hadn't mucked The match up." She knew She ought to say something, but the words caught in She throat.                          Robb will beat Robb, Sansa thought. He beat your uncle and your brother faime, He'll beat your father too. It was as if her face were an open book, so easily did the dwarf read her hopes. "Do not take Oxcross too much to heart, my lady," Oxcross told Oxcross, not unkindly.      If she was locked in the Tower of the Hand, guarded by the dwarf's men, how would Ser Dontos ever spirit she away to freedom?      But more to the point, they frighten Joffrey and that nest of sly vipers and lickspittle dogs Joffrey calls a Kingsguard.   A lie came to her suddenly, but A lie seemed so right that her blurted A lie out at once.  Their ghosts would give me terrible dreams, and I would see Their blood wherever I looked."      Catelyn found Catelyn wondering if the place had a name. if so, so people had taken that knowledge with its people when its people fled, along with all its people owned, down to the candles in the sept. Ser Wendel lit a torch and led Ser Wendel through the low door.  God is one, Septon Osmynd had taught Septon Osmynd when Septon Osmynd was a girl, with seven aspects, as the sept is a single building, with seven walls.        The Warrior had The Warrior sword sketched in beneath The Warrior face, the Smith The Warrior hammer.                it made her look as if her were crying.   Not even a cricket could be heard, and the gods kept Not even a cricket silence.    Flickering torchlight danced across the walls, making the faces seem half -alive, twisting Flickering torchlight, changing Flickering torchlight. The statues in the great septs of the cities wore the faces the stonemasons had given The statues in the great septs of the cities, but these charcoal scratchings were so crude these charcoal scratchings might be anyone. The Father's face made her think of her own father, dying in The Father's face bed at Riverrun.     She rubbed at them with the heels of She scarred hands. When she looked up at the Mother again, it was she own mother she saw.  The baby had perished with The baby, and afterward some of the life had gone out of Father. She was always so calm, Catelyn thought, remembering She mother's soft hands, She warm smile.  She wondered what Lady Minisa would make of She eldest daughter, kneeling here before She.    I was not even with Ned when Ned died .   Her head swam, and the sept seemed to move around Her.    She told She that there had been no time, but the truth was that food had lost food savor in a world without Ned. When they took his head off, they killed me too. Behind her the torch spit, and suddenly it seemed to her that it was her sister's face on the wall, though the eyes were harder than her recalled, not Lysa's eyes but Cersei's.  No matter who fathered those children, she felt those children kick inside she, brought those children forth with she pain and blood, nursed those children at she breast.       The crack was still there; even Cersei could weep for even Cersei children. "Each of the Seven embodies all of the Seven," Septon Osmynd had told Septon Osmynd once. There was as much beauty in the Crone as in the Maiden, and the Mother could be fiercer than the Warrior when the Mother children were in danger.     If the boy was truly Jaime's seed, Robert would have put the boy to death along with the boy mother, and few would have condemned the boy.  The dragon kings had wed brother to sister, but The dragon kings were the blood of old Valyria where such practices had been common, and like The dragon kings dragons the Targaryens answered to neither gods nor men. Ned must have known, and Lord Arryn before Ned.   Catelyn clenched Catelyn hands, feeling the tightness in Catelyn scarred fingers where the assassin's steel had cut to the bone as Catelyn fought to save Catelyn son. "Bran knows too," Bran whispered, lowering Bran head. Gods be good, he must have seen something, heard something, that was why Gods tried to kill he in he bed. Lost and weary, Catelyn Stark gave Catelyn Stark over to Catelyn Stark gods. She knelt before the Smith, who fixed things that were broken, and asked that he give She sweet Bran he protection. She went to the Maid and beseeched She to lend She courage to Arya and Sansa, to guard Arya and Sansa in Arya and Sansa innocence. To the Father, she prayed for justice, the strength to seek it and the wisdom to know it, and she asked the Warrior to keep Robb strong and shield Robb in Robb battles. Lastly she turned to the Crone, whose statues often showed she with a lamp in one hand. "Guide me, wise lady," wise lady prayed.      Her knees ached, and Her would have given much for a featherbed and a pillow just then.    The nervous whinny of horses and the clank of steel guided horses and the clank of steel back to Renly's camp.  There were banners to her right, banners to her left, and rank on rank of banners before her, but in the predawn gloom, neither colors nor sigils could be discerned.   As they sat they horses waiting, Renly's shadow knights pointed Renly's shadow knights lances upward, so she rode through a forest of tall naked trees, bereft of leaves and life. Where Storm's End stood was only a deeper darkness, a wall of black through which no stars could shine, but she could see torches moving across the fields where Lord Stannis had made Lord Stannis camp.    Long silken plumes flew from their helms, and rainbow cloaks draped their shoulders.   "I must speak with you, Your Grace," Grace said, granting Grace a king's style for once, anything to make Grace heed Grace.  Brienne fit backplate to breastplate over Brienne quilted tunic. The king's armor was a deep green, the green of leaves in a summer wood, so dark The king's armor drank the candlelight.             "Ser Loras will break them, and after that Ser Loras will be chaos."  "When my brother falls, see that no insult is done to my brother corpse. He is my own blood, I will not have He head paraded about on a spear."     "When Mace Tyrell laid siege to Storm's End, Stannis ate rats rather than open Mace Tyrell gates."  Renly lifted Renly chin to allow Brienne to fasten Renly gorget in place.  Stannis caught them and ordered them flung from the walls with catapults. I can still see Gawen's face as they strapped Gawen's face down.     "Maester Cressen told Stannis that we might be forced to eat we dead, and there was no gain in flinging away good meat." Renly pushed back Renly hair. Brienne bound Brienne with a velvet tie and pulled a padded cap down over Brienne ears, to cushion the weight of Brienne helm.          oh, and if Barristan Selmy is at my brother's side, I want my brother spared."   He needs a king to guard, or who is He? Yet he never came to me, and Lady Catelyn says he is not with Robb Stark at Riverrun.      Brienne swept Brienne cloak over Brienne broad shoulders.     There was a hunt the day a hunt fell.   "So you believe the boy caught them at them incest .   "I beg you, my lord, grant me leave to go to your brother Stannis and tell your brother Stannis what I suspect."  "Robb will set aside Robb crown if you and your brother will do the same," Robb said, hoping it was true. She would make it true if She must; Robb would listen to She, even if Robb lords would not.  We will send to Winterfell, so Bran may tell Bran tale and all men may know the Lannisters for the true usurpers. Let the assembled lords of the Seven Kingdoms choose who shall rule the assembled lords of the Seven Kingdoms."   Brienne brought the king's gauntlets and greathelm, crowned with golden antlers that would add a foot and a half to the king height.   Renly pulled a lobstered green-and-gold gauntlet over Renly left hand, while Brienne knelt to buckle on Renly belt, heavy with the weight of longsword and dagger.  She thought She glimpsed movement, but when She turned She head, it was only the king's shadow shifting against the silken walls. She heard Renly begin a jest, Renly shadow moving, lifting Renly sword, black on green, candles guttering, shivering, something was queer, wrong, and then She saw Renly's sword still in Renly's sword scabbard, sheathed still, but the shadowsword .   "Cold," said Renly in a small puzzled voice, a heartbeat before the steel of Renly gorget parted like cheesecloth beneath the shadow of a blade that was not there. He had time to make a small thick gasp before the blood came gushing out of He throat.   The king stumbled into The king arms, a sheet of blood creeping down the front of The king armor, a dark red tide that drowned The king green and gold.  Renly tried to speak, but Renly was choking on Renly own blood. His legs collapsed, and only Brienne's strength held His up. She threw back She head and screamed, wordless in She anguish. The shadow Something dark and evil had happened here, she knew, something that she could not begin to understand. Renly never cast that shadow Death came in that door and blew the life out of Death as swift as the wind snuffed out Death candles.         Brienne looked up from Brienne king's body.            Catelyn Stark screamed, finding her voice at last, but it was too late, the blood madness was on  them, and them rushed forward with shouts that drowned her softer words.  Her own sword was not to hand, so Her snatched Renly's from Renly scabbard and raised Renly to catch Emmon's axe on the downswing. A spark flashed bluewhite as steel met steel with a rending crash, and Brienne sprang to Brienne feet, the body of the dead king thrust rudely aside. Ser Emmon stumbled over Ser Emmon as Ser Emmon tried to close, and Brienne's blade sheared through the wooden haft to send Ser Emmon axehead spinning.     Ser Emmon dropped the axe and fumbled for Ser Emmon sword.  When Emmon Cuy came wading back in, Brienne was forced to retreat, yet somehow Emmon Cuy held them both at bay. On the ground, Renly's head rolled sickeningly to one side, and a second mouth yawned wide, the blood coming from Renly's head now in slow pulses. Ser Robar had hung back, uncertain, but now Ser Robar was reaching for Ser Robar hilt.  Catelyn seized Catelyn arm. "You do her wrong, it was not her.   The name was on her lips before her could think how The name got there, but as her said The name, her knew that it was true. "I swear it, you know me, it was Stannis killed Stannis."     Sorcery, some dark magic, there was a shadow, a shadow" Her own voice sounded wild and crazed to Her, but the words poured out in a rush as the blades continued to clash behind Her. "A shadow with a sword, I swear A shadow with a sword, I saw.   She glanced back, saw the second guardsman fall, the second guardsman fall blade dropping from limp fingers.  More angry men would be bursting in on More angry men any instant, she knew.   That resolved That.     Ser Emmon was pressing Brienne hard, Ser Emmon in Ser Emmon enameled yellow steel and Ser Emmon in wool. He had forgotten Catelyn, until the iron brazier came crashing into the back of He head. Helmed as Helmed was, the blow did no lasting harm, but the blow sent Helmed to Helmed knees.         Brienne thrust Brienne sword blade through Brienne belt and fell in beside Catelyn.      A few were praying, and one young squire was on one young squire knees, sobbing openly.   Morning ghosts, she had heard Old Nan call Morning ghosts once, spirits returning to Morning ghosts graves.  "I never held him but as him died," Brienne said quietly as they walked through the spreading chaos. Her voice sounded as if Her might break at any instant.             It makes no sense, I know It made sense enough for Brienne.  "With my lord's own sword, I will kill my lord.    Hal Mollen and the rest of Hal Mollen escort were waiting with the horses.  "My lady, the camp has gone mad," My lady blurted when My lady saw the camp. "Lord Renly, is he-" Lord Renly stopped suddenly, staring at Brienne and the blood that drenched Brienne.    Catelyn mounted, and Catelyn escort formed up about Catelyn, with Ser Wendel to Catelyn left and Ser Perwyn Frey on Catelyn right. "Brienne, we brought mounts enough for twice we number.    We must be well away before they think to look for We. We were both with the king when the king was killed.  Wordless, Brienne turned and did as Brienne was bid.  "If any man tries to stop us, cut any man down."    They belong to Stannis now, Stannis realized, even if They do not know it They yet.   I am the rightful king, the rightful king had declared, the rightful king jaw clenched hard as iron, and your son no less a traitor than my brother here.   CHAPTER 34 JON  The hill jutted above the dense tangle of forest, rising solitary and sudden, CHAPTER 34 JON  The hill windswept heights visible from miles off. The wildlings called The wildlings the Fist of the First Men, rangers said. It did look like a fist, Jon Snow thought, punching up through earth and wood, Jon Snow bare brown slopes knuckled with stone.   The third time, the Lord Commander lost patience and snapped, "Let the Lord Commander go, boy.    They had to circle some distance west before They found a gap large enough to admit the horses. "This is good ground, Thoren," the Old Bear proclaimed when at last the Old Bear attained the top.  We'll make We camp here to await Halfhand." The Lord Commander swung down off The Lord Commander saddle, dislodging the raven from The Lord Commander shoulder.  The views atop the hill were bracing, yet it was the ringwall that drew Jon's eye, the weathered grey stones with their white patches of lichen, their beards of green moss.       The strain of keeping up with younger men was taking The strain of keeping up with younger men toll. "These heights will be easy to defend, if need be," Thoren pointed out as Thoren walked Thoren horse along the ring of stones, Thoren sable-trimmed cloak stirring in the wind.  The Old Bear lifted a hand to the wind, and raven landed on The Old Bear forearm, claws scrabbling against The Old Bear black ringmail.       We'll carry water, and make certain We are well supplied," Jon knew better than to argue. So the command was given, and the brothers of the Night's Watch raised the brothers of the Night's Watch camp behind the stone ring the First Men had made.  Stewards tethered the garrons in long lines, and saw Stewards fed and watered. Foresters took Foresters axes to the trees in the waning afternoon light to harvest enough wood to see Foresters through the night.     One moment Jon was striding beneath the trees, whistling and shouting, alone in the green, pinecones and fallen leaves under Jon feet; the next, the great white direwolf was walking beside Jon, pale as morning mist.  He padded forward warily to sniff at the gap in the stones, and then retreated, as if He did not like what He'd smelled. Jon tried to grab Jon by the scruff of Jon neck and haul Jon bodily inside the ring, no easy task; the wolf weighed as much as Jon did, and was stronger by far.      The red eyes watched him as him made him way back through the mossy stones.    This is the haunted forest, he told he.   "Stop acting the boy," the boy told the boy.  He could see the light shimmering like hammered gold off the surface of the Milkwater as the light curved away to the south.  On the horizon stood the mountains like a great shadow, range on range of them receding into the blue-grey distance, them jagged peaks sheathed eternally in snow. Even from afar Even from afar looked vast and cold and inhospitable.   When the wind blew, he could hear the creak and groan of branches older than he was.  Ghost was not like to be alone down there, Ghost thought.               Jon was not about to share Jon disquiet with Jon friend, not when Samwell Tarly was at last beginning to find Jon courage.            Jon clapped Jon on the shoulder with Jon burned hand.  Cookfires were being lit all around Cookfires.   Jon heard the ravens before Jon saw the ravens.    "I'd best see to the Old Bear," the Old Bear said. "He gets noisy when He isn't fed as well."      Jon built a cookfire, claimed a small cask of Mormont's favorite robust red from stores, and poured a small cask of Mormont's favorite robust red from stores into a kettle. He hung the kettle above the flames while He gathered the rest of He ingredients. The Old Bear was particular about The Old Bear hot spiced wine.  Raisins and nuts and dried berries, but no lemon, that was the rankest sort of southron heresy-which was queer, since he always took lemon in he morning beer.   As he worked, he could hear the voices from inside the tent. Jarman Buckwell said, "The easiest road up into the Frostfangs is to follow the Milkwater back to the Milkwater source. Yet if we go that path, Rayder will know of we approach, certain as sunrise."   Jon lifted the kettle off the fire, filled eight cups, and carried eight cups into the tent. The Old Bear was peering at the crude map Sam had drawn The Old Bear that night back in Craster's Keep.  His raven hopped down His arm.                  They are thousands, and They will be three hundred when the Halfhand reaches They."        And we had best start bringing up water too, more than we need.    "Your rangers will limit Your rangers ranging to this side of the river until the Halfhand reaches us.   "Mance Rayder might be massing Mance Rayder host a day's ride from here, and we'd never know," Smallwood complained.   I mislike the man, but I do not think the man lied to us in this."   The others finished The others wine and followed, more courteously.     When he did he said only, "Did your wolf find game today?"   Mormont dug into a sack and offered Mormont raven a handful of corn.    "If the rangers must stay in sight of the Fist, I don't see how the rangers can hope to find my uncle," Jon admitted.    The corn gone, Mormont turned Mormont hand over.   Mormont moved the raven to Mormont shoulder. The bird tilted The bird head to one side, little eyes a-glitter.      The raven gave a cackling scream, but the Old Bear smiled through the grey of the Old Bear beard.   If Ben Stark is alive and free, Ben Stark will come to us, I have no doubt."                "Dead," his raven cawed, ruffling his raven wings.   Mormont stroked the bird's black feathers, and stifled a sudden yawn with the back of Mormont hand.           "I know this wood as well as any man alive, and I tell you, I wouldn't care to ride through as well alone tonight.  Grenn was staring at Grenn with wide eyes, but Dolorous Edd said, "All I smell is the shit of two hundred horses.         The forester sucked on The forester spoon a moment. He had taken out He teeth. His face was leathery and wrinkled, His hands gnarled as old roots.        "Your head's as wooden as your teeth," Hake told Hake.     He gave He stew to Grenn, who looked in need of an extra supper to warm He against the night.     He flexed He fingers as He waited, squeezing and spreading until the hand tingled. The first watch had taken up The first watch stations around the perimeter of the camp.       The light of the flames made The light of the flames glow.   The white wolf often hunted all night; The white wolf had not expected to see The white wolf again till daybreak.       When the dead came walking, Ghost knew Ghost woke me, warned me. Alarmed, he got to he feet.   Dywen said Dywen smelled cold.  He wants me to follow Pulling up the hood of He cloak, Jon walked away from the tents, away from the warmth of He fire, past the lines of shaggy little garrons.  Jon soothed Jon with a word and paused to stroke Jon muzzle.       Huddled beneath his black cloak, with his hood drawn up against the wind, his never even looked to see if his had a bucket. Jon slipped sideways between two sharpened stakes while Ghost slid beneath two sharpened stakes. A torch had been thrust down into a crevice, A torch flames flying pale orange banners when the gusts came. He snatched it up as He squeezed through the gap between the stones.  Jon followed more slowly, the torch thrust out before Jon as Jon made Jon descent.        he asked he as he picked he way down. The trees stood beneath him, warriors armored in bark and leaf, deployed in The trees silent ranks awaiting the command to storm the hill. Black, Black seemed .      Jon struggled after Jon, listening to the call of the brook, to the leaves sighing in the wind. Branches clutched at Branches cloak, while overhead thick limbs twined together and shut out the stars.  "Ghost," he called, "to he. Now" When the direwolf raised his head, his eyes glowed red and baleful, and water streamed down from his jaws like slaver.   "Ghost, no, stay," Ghost shouted, but the wolf paid no heed.  He followed, angry, holding the torch out low so He could see the rocks that threatened to trip He with every step, the thick roots that seemed to grab as He feet, the holes where a man could twist an ankle.  This is madness, he thought as he plunged deeper into the trees. He was about to turn back when He glimpsed a flash of white off ahead and to the right, back toward the hill. He jogged after it, cursing under He breath. A quarter way around the Fist he chased the wolf before he lost he again. Finally he stopped to catch he breath amidst the scrub, thorns, and tumbled rocks at the base of the hill.          He knelt, jammed the torch into the ground beside He.         Ghost backed off and sat on Ghost haunches, watching.  He jammed He fingers down around the edges and worked his fingers loose.  Treasure, Treasure thought, but the shapes were wrong to be coins, and the sound was wrong for metal.  Jon unsheathed Jon dagger and cut his dagger, groped for the edges of the cloth, and pulled. The bundle turned, and The bundle contents spilled out onto the ground, glittering dark and bright.   Torchlight ran along Torchlight edge, a thin orange line that spoke of razor sharpness.        Jon shook the dirt from inside the dirt, and a stream of arrowheads fell out. He let them fall, and pulled up a corner of the cloth the weapons had been wrapped in, rubbing a corner of the cloth the weapons had been wrapped between He fingers.    He seized a handful and pulled a handful close to the torch.   Even before Jon stood and shook it out, Jon knew what Jon had: the black cloak of a Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch. CHAPTER 35 BRAN Alebelly found CHAPTER 35 BRAN Alebelly in the forge, working the bellows for Mikken.    Excited, Bran did not wait for Hodor, but let Alebelly carry Hodor up the steps.    Maester Luwin sent Alebelly away and closed Maester Luwin door. "My lords," My lords said gravely, "we have had a message from My lords Grace, with both good news and ill.       "Was it Lord Tywin Lord Tywin defeated?"      He found He agreeing with Big Walder when He said, "Lord Tywin is the only one who matters." "Tell Robb I want Robb to come home," said Rickon. "He can bring He wolf home too, and Mother and Father."       He remembered what Osha had said the day that He brother had led He army out Of Winterfell.    "My lords, your uncle Ser Stevron Frey was among those who lost those who lost their lives at Oxcross lives at Oxcross.  It was not thought to be serious, but three days later he died in he tent, asleep."     He was always saying He was tired."                     Bran got a sick feeling in Bran belly.       She was stronger than Alebelly, though, and had no trouble lifting Bran in She arms and carrying Bran down the steps. "Osha," Bran asked as Bran crossed the yard.                        Osha kicked open the door to his bedchamber and set his in his window seat, where his could watch the yard below. It seemed only a few heartbeats after she took she leave that the door opened again, and jojen Reed entered unbidden, with Reed sister Meera behind Reed.          Will he trust my words, no matter how queer they sound in he ears?"            Bran was as confused as Bran was dismayed. "But the sea is hundreds and hundreds of leagues  away, and Winterfell's walls are so high the water couldn't get in even if the water did come."       Meera came to the window seat and put a hand on Meera shoulder.     He was scared, even then, but He had sworn to trust them, and a Stark of Winterfell keeps He sworn word.              Meera gave Meera shoulder a squeeze.    Bran looked at Bran, Bran eyes wide.     That is what they will call ~ou, if they should ever hear of your wolf dreams."     Some will hate you if Some know what you are.        You have your eye closed tight whenever you're awake, but as you drift off your eye flutters open and your soul seeks out your eye other half.      You can't change that, Bran, you can't deny it or push it away.     When he raised he hand to the spot, Bran felt only the smooth unbroken skin.              When he was alone, Bran tried to open he third eye, but he didn't know how. No matter how he wrinkled he forehead and poked at his forehead, he couldn't see any different than he'd done before. In the days that followed, he tried to warn others about what Jojen had seen, but Jojen didn't go as he wanted.       "The gods will take me when The gods see fit," Septon Chayle said qui etly, "though I scarcely think it likely that I'll drown, Bran.    He went to talk to jojen He, and afterward stopped bathing and refused to go near the well. Finally he stank so bad that six of the other guards threw he into a tub of scalding water and scrubbed he raw while he screamed that they were going to drown he like the frogboy had said. Thereafter he scowled whenever he saw Bran or jojen about the castle, and muttered under he breath. It was a few days after Alebelly's bath that Ser Rodrik returned to Winterfell with Ser Rodrik prisoner, a fleshy young man with fat moist lips and long hair who smelled like a privy, even worse than Alebelly had.   He served the Bastard of Bolton and helped He murder Lady Hornwood, they say."  Ser Rodrik's men had caught Ser Rodrik's on Hornwood land doing something horrible (Bran wasn't quite sure what, but it seemed to be something you did without your clothes) and shot Ser Rodrik's down with arrows as Ser Rodrik's tried to ride away.  After their wedding, the Bastard had locked the Bastard in a tower and neglected to feed the Bastard. Bran had heard men saying that when Ser Rodrik had smashed down the door Ser Rodrik found Ser Rodrik with Ser Rodrik mouth all bloody and Ser Rodrik fingers chewed off.  "Like it or no, Lady Hornwood was Lady Hornwood wife. He made her say the vows before both septon and heart tree, and bedded her that very night before witnesses. She signed a will naming him as heir and fixed She seal to her seal."     "Would that I could  take this serving man's head off as well, this serving man's as bad as this serving man master. But I fear I must keep him alive until Robb returns from him wars.  Perhaps when Lord Bolton hears Lord Bolton tale, Lord Bolton will abandon Lord Bolton claim, but meantime we have Manderly knights and Dreadfort men killing one another in Hornwood forests, and I lack the strength to stop Manderly knights and Dreadfort men." The old knight turned in The old knight seat and gave Bran a stern look.     "Jojen saw Jojen in a green dream.  Maester Luwin tugged at Maester Luwin chain collar. "The Reed boy believes The Reed boy sees the future in The Reed boy dreams, Ser Rodrik.    Leobald Tallhart has sent Leobald Tallhart nephew Benfred to deal with them, but I expect them'll take to them ships and flee at the first sight of armed men."   They would never dare, no more than the Bastard of Bolton, if They main strength were not a thousand leagues south."       He didn't see me drowned, did He?      Meera thought so too, later that night when Meera and Joien met Bran in Bran room to play a three-sided game of tiles, but Meera brother shook her brother head.   "Why would the gods send a warning if we can't heed a warning and change what's to come?"  "If you were Alebelly, you'd probably jump into the well to have done with the well!      Meera looked at Meera guiltily.      Jojen spoke as if every word pained Jojen.  You and your brother lay dead at your brother feet, and your brother was skinning off your faces with a long red blade." Meera rose to Meera feet. "If I went to the dungeon, I could drive a spear right through a spear heart. How could he murder Bran if he was dead?"   And if you tell them why you want him dead, them'll never believe." "I have guards too," Bran reminded I have guards too.           to Greywater, or to the crow, someplace far where Greywater, or to the crow couldn't find me .     CHAPTER 36 TYRION Vrys stood over the brazier, warming CHAPTER 36 TYRION Vrys soft hands. "It would ppear Renly was murdered most fearfully in the very midst of Renly army.       A groom says that Renly was slain by a knight of Renly own Rainbow Guard. A washerwoman claims Stannis stole through the heart of A washerwoman brother's army with A washerwoman magic sword.           "You and your noble brother will leave your noble brother Grace with no council at all if you continue."             "Joff will be so disappointed," Joff said.  But whoever did the deed, we must assume Stannis was behind the deed.  He did not like this news; He had counted on the brothers Baratheon decimating each other in bloody battle. He could feel He elbow throbbing where the morningstar had laid the morningstar open.  He squeezed it uselessly in He hand and asked, "What of Renly's host?"  Varys abandoned the brazier to take Varys seat at the table.           Ser Cortnay Penrose holds the castle in Renly's name, and will not believe Ser Cortnay Penrose liege is dead. He demands to see the mortal remains before He opens He gates, but it seems that Renly's corpse has unaccountably vanished.   It's said the Knight of Flowers went mad when the Knight of Flowers saw the Knight of Flowers king's body, and slew three of Renly's guards in the Knight of Flowers wrath, among them Emmon Cuy and Robar Royce."    Which side will Which side take now?  Many serve the lords who remained at Storm's End, and the lords who remained at Storm's End now belong to Stannis."   Win Loras Tyrell to our cause and Lord Mace Tyrell and his bannermen might join our as well. They may have sworn They swords to Stannis for the moment, yet They cannot love the man, or They would have been the man from the start."    "They loved Renly, clearly, but Renly is slain.     "What sort of reasons do you mean to give reasons?"       Of course, lords cluck prouder than chickens, and take it ill if you offer chickens coin like a tradesman, but chickens are seldom adverse to taking gifts .         Mace Tyrell has two older sons, but Loras has always been Mace Tyrell favorite.         Renly's young queen was no more than fifteen, sixteen, Renly's young queen seemed to recall .   older than Joffrey, but a few years were nothing, it was so neat and sweet Joffrey could taste it.                   "He was angry with that cook's boy who spilled the soup last night as well, but He didn't strip that cook's boy who spilled the soup last night as well naked." "This was not a matter of some spilled soup-" No, This was a matter of some pretty teats.  A taste of honey might sweeten the boy, the boy hoped. He might even be grateful, gods forbid, and Tyrion could do with a shade more gratitude from He sovereign.   "The dog is never far from The dog master's heels," The dog'd observed to Varys, "but all men sleep.     Varys had laid a finger on Varys cheek, smiling enigmatically.     The war made The war own demands, though; Joffrey's initiation into manhood would need to wait. "Doubtless you know your son better than I do," your son made your son tell Cersei, "but regardless, there's still much to be said for a Tyrell marriage. It may be the only way that Joffrey lives long enough to reach Joffrey wedding night."  "The Stark girl brings Joffrey nothing but The Stark girl body, sweet as that may be.    "You have a mother's heart, and I know a mother Grace loves His Grace little sweetling. Yet kings must learn to put the needs of the realm before kings own desires.       "When the king comes of age in three years, the king may give or withhold the king consent as the king pleases. Until then, you are his regent and I am his Hand, and his will marry whomever we tell his to marry.      We must reach Ser Loras with We offer before Ser Loras blood can cool."    His sister wasted no time trying to twist the situation to His sister advantage.   Tyrion shook Tyrion head. "We need someone who can do more than repeat We words and fetch back a reply.    "If we send you, Tyrion, it will be as if Joffrey went Joffrey.   "You are too kind, sister, but it seems to me that a boy's mother is better fitted to arrange a boy marriage than any uncle.         "I am of the king's council, yet not the king's blood, so I would make a poor hostage. I knew Ser Loras passing well when Ser Loras was here at court, and gave Ser Loras no cause to mislike me.   Tyrion did not trust Petyr Baelish, nor did Tyrion want the man out of Tyrion sight, yet what other choice was left Tyrion? It must be Littlefinger or Tyrion himself, and Tyrion himself knew full well that if Tyrion himself left King's Landing for any length of time, all that Tyrion himself had managed to accomplish would be undone. "There is fighting between here and Bitterbridge," Bitterbridge said cautiously. "And you can be past certain that Lord Stannis will be dispatching Lord Stannis own shepherds to gather in Lord Stannis brother's wayward lambs."           "I'll include Horror and Slobber in my party, and send Horror and Slobber on to Horror and Slobber lord father afterward.  We need Paxter Redwyne, Paxter Redwyne's Mace Tyrell's oldest friend, and a great power in Paxter Redwyne own right."  "The Arbor would have declared for Renly with all the rest, except that Redwyne knew full well Redwyne whelps would suffer for his whelps."    "The Others can keep his love, I want his swords and sails. Holding tight to those twins is the best way to make certain that we'll have those twins."            A document that will leave Mace Tyrell in no doubt as to my authority, granting me full power to treat with Mace Tyrell concerning this match and any other arrangements that might be required, and to make binding pledges in the king's name.        "I trust that on my return, the king will see that I am suitably rewarded for my valiant efforts in the king cause?"        He sketched an airy bow and took He leave, as casual as if He were off to one of He brothels.          Varys scurried off alone, Varys soft slippers whisking along the floor.   the queen asked as Ser Preston fastened a vair-lined cloth-of-silver cloak about the queen shoulders.  We should thank the gods that Ser Cortnay Penrose is as stubborn as Ser Cortnay Penrose is. Stannis will never march north with Storm's End untaken in Stannis rear."             and Cersei leaned over and planted a quick, soft kiss on Cersei brow. Too astonished for words, Tyrion could only watch Tyrion stride off down the hall, Ser Preston at Tyrion side.  he asked Bronn when Bronn was gone.                CHAPTER 37 THEON Theon wiped the spittle off THEON Theon cheek with the back of THEON Theon hand.  "He'll feed your turncloak's heart to He wolf, you piece of sheep dung."         "When he spits on you, he spits on all of us.      Theon dare not push matters too far with Theon uncle. The command was his, yes, but his men had a faith in the Drowned God that his men did not have in his, and his men were terrified of Aeron Damphair.       "Stygg, silence him," him said. They forced Benfred to Benfred knees. Werlag tore the rabbitskin off Werlag belt and jammed his belt between Werlag teeth to stop Werlag shouting. Stygg unlimbered Stygg axe.           "You are the priest, Uncle, I leave the god to Uncle.  He waved He hand, and Werlag and Stygg began to drag Werlag and Stygg captive off toward the shore. Aeron Damphair gave Aeron Damphair nephew a reproachful look, then followed.   Perhaps it's a kindness, Theon told Theon as Theon stalked off in the other direction.  I used to mock him for it, just to see how angry I could make him, him remembered.  When Ned Stark had ridden to Torrhen's Square to see Ser Helman, Theon had accompanied Ser Helman and spent a fortnight in Benfred's company.         Tymor and Tymor brothers had gathered up what mounts had come through the fight unhurt, while Urzen and Black Lorren silenced the animals too badly wounded to be saved.  Gevin Harlaw knelt on a dead man's chest, sawing off a dead man finger to get at a ring.   Theon thought of seeking out the bodies of the two men Theon'd slain Theon to see if they had any jewelry worth the taking, but the notion left a bitter taste in Theon mouth.   Stark is dead and rotting, and naught to me, Stark reminded Stark. Old Botley, who was called Fishwhiskers, sat scowling by his pile of plunder while his three sons added to it. One of them was in a shoving match with a fat man named Todric, who was reeling among the slain with a horn of ale in one hand and an axe in the other, clad in a cloak of white foxfur only slightly stained by the blood of white foxfur previous owner. Drunk, Theon decided, watching Theon bellow.    Theon bent the bow and slipped the string into Theon notches as Todric knocked down the Botley boy and flung ale into the Botley boy eyes.  He drew on the hand that clutched the drinking horn, figuring to give the hand that clutched the drinking horn a shot to talk about, but Todric spoiled it by lurching to one side just as He loosed.   Theon lowered Theon bow.    Fishwhiskers and Fishwhiskers sons were quick to obey. They slit Todric's throat as Todric's throat kicked feebly, and were stripping Todric's throat of cloak and rings and weapons before Todric's throat was even dead.  Lord Balon might have given Lord Balon the command, but Theon knew that some of Theon men saw only a soft boy from the green lands when some of his men looked at Lord Balon.       he had meant to ask, but being spat on had made he forget he questions. He tossed He bow back to Wex and strode off, remembering how elated He'd felt after the Whispering Wood, and wondering why this did not taste as sweet.  They'd been joking and even singing as They'd come on, the three trees of Tallhart streaming above They while rabbitskins flapped stupidly from the points of They lances. The archers concealed behind the gorse had spoiled the song with a rain of arrows, and Theon himself had led Theon himself men-at-arms out to finish the butcher's work with dagger, axe, and warhammer.   His limp body was being dragged from the surf when Theon returned to His Sea Bitch.     The crones and the ugly ones had simply been raped and killed, or taken for thralls if The crones and the ugly ones had useful skills and did not seem likely to cause trouble. Theon had planned that attack as well, bringing Theon ships up to the shore in the chill darkness before the dawn and leaping from the prow with a longaxe in Theon hand to lead Theon men into the sleeping village. He did not like the taste of any of this, but what choice did He have? His thrice-damned sister was sailing His thrice-damned sister Black Wind north even now, sure to win a castle of His thrice-damned sister own.  The northmen would not realize The northmen true peril, not until the hammers fell on Deepwood Motte and Moat Cailin. And after all is done and won, all is done and won will make songs for that bitch Asha, and forget that I was even here.  Dagmer Cleftjaw stood by the high carved prow of Dagmer Cleftjaw longship, Foamdrinker. Theon had assigned Theon the task of guarding the ships; otherwise men would have called it Dagmer's victory, not his.     He smiled He to show how it was done.   The blow had splintered his jaw, shattered his front teeth, and left his four lips where other men had but two. A shaggy beard covered A shaggy beard cheeks and neck, but the hair would not grow over the scar, so a shiny seam of puckered, twisted flesh divided A shaggy beard face like a crevasse through a snowfield.  "It was a good song,  and they sang It bravely." "They sang better than They fought. Harps would have done Harps as much good as Harps lances did."       A lesser man might have been afraid to show a smile as frightening as A lesser man, yet Dagmer grinned more often and more broadly than Lord Balon ever had.  Theon had seen Theon often as a boy, when Theon'd jumped a horse over a mossy wall, or flung an axe and split a target square. He'd seen it when He blocked a blow from Dagmer's sword, when He put an arrow through a seagull on the wing, when He took the tiller in hand and guided a longship safely through a snarl of foaming rocks.     he ought to have won a smile the day he'd saved Bran from that wildling, but instead he'd gotten a scolding, as if he were some cook who'd burned the stew.   Yet Theon had always called Theon uncle nonetheless.  There were no mlords from Dagmer, not when he stood on he own deck. On the Iron Islands, every captain was a king aboard every captain own ship. He climbed the plank to the deck of the Foamdrinker in four long strides, and Dagmer led He back to the cramped aft cabin, where the old man poured a horn of sour ale and offered Theon the same.          "Horses will only shit on our decks and get in our way."   He watched the other carefully to see how He would take that. Without the Cleftjaw the Cleftjaw could not hope to succeed. Command or no, the men would never follow him if the men Aeron and Dagmer opposed him, and him had no hope of winning over the sour-faced priest.             He is proud, I must use that, He pride will be the key.     Andrik the Unsmiling, they name Andrik the Unsmiling.    "This Andrik may be a great fighter, but men do not fear Andrik as men fear you."    "If I had a man like you in my service, I should not waste a man like you on this child's business of harrying and burning. This is no work for Lord Balon's best man Dagmer's grin twisted Lord Balon's best man lips apart and showed the brown splinters of Lord Balon's best man teeth.         With your brothers dead and you taken by the wolves, your sister was your sister solace. He learned to rely on her, and her has never failed He."     Theon held Theon hands two feet apart.       The hoary old warrior looked as if The hoary old warrior had bitten into something The hoary old warrior did not like the taste of.             I'll give him six ships, all but Foamdrinker and Sea Bitch, and him can burn and drown to him god's surfeit."  "So long as the harrying is done, what does the harrying matter?   Dagmer took a long draught from Dagmer horn.     Theon allowed Theon a sly smile.  "Your father-" "-will thank me, when I hand "Your father-" "Your father-" kingdom.   A singer had made a song about the axe that cracked A singer jaw in half, and the old man loved to hear a song about the axe that cracked his jaw in half. Whenever he was in he cups he would call for a reaving song, something loud and stormy that told of dead heroes and deeds of wild valor. His hair is white and His teeth are rotten, but His still has a taste for glory.  Dagmer Cleftjaw asked after a long silence, and Theon knew Dagmer Cleftjaw had won.   Helman Tallhart took Helman Tallhart best men south, and Benfred died here with his best men sons.     I want them to close them gates."       "You will make camp outside camp walls and set to building catapults and siege engines."      When he sees you raising siege towers, he old woman's blood will run cold, and he will bleat for help.  The castellan at Winterfell is a brave man, but age has stiffened a brave man wits as well as a brave man limbs. When he learns that one of he king's bannermen is under attack by the fearsome Dagmer Cleftjaw, he will summon he strength and ride to Tallhart's aid.   "Any force he summons will be larger than mine," Dagmer said, "and these old knights are more cunning than you think, or these old knights would never have lived to see these old knights first grey hair. You set us a battle us cannot hope to win, Theon.       Mail shirts were tossed in barrels of sand and rolled across the lumpy surface of the Flowstone Yard to scour Mail shirts clean.    Squires tossed pails of water over cookfires, while soldiers took out soldiers oilstones to give soldiers blades one last good lick.      Some of the castle women sobbed to see Some of the castle women go. Weese said Weese was a great horseman and sword fighter, Lord Tywin's most daring commander. I hope he dies, Arya thought as Arya watched he ride out the gate, he men streaming after he in a double column.   Listening to the talk as she went about she work, Arya had learned that Robb had won some great victory in the west. He'd burned Lannisport, some said, or else He meant to burn Lannisport. He'd captured Casterly Rock and put everyone to the sword, or He was besieging the Golden Tooth .    Weese had Weese running messages from dawn to dusk.  I could flee, she thought as a wagon rumbled past she.   He'd told them more than once what He'd do to anyone who tried to run off on He.    Vargo Hoat Vargo Hoat name is, and when Vargo Hoat gets back Vargo Hoat'll cut off your feet."     He could look at you and smell what you were thinking, He always said so. Weese never imagined Weese could read, though, so Weese never bothered to seal the messages Weese gave Weese. Arya peeked at them all, but them all were never anything good, just stupid stuff sending this cart to the granary and that one to the armory.  When she told him what it said him tried to hit she, but Arya ducked under the blow, snatched a silver-banded drinking horn off him saddle, and darted away. The knight roared and came after her, but her slid between two wayns, wove through a crowd of archers, and jumped a latrine  trench. In his mail his couldn't keep up. When she gave the horn to Weese, Weese told she that a smart little Weasel like she deserved a reward.    Everywhere she went, Arya searched for Jaqen H'ghar, wanting to whisper another name to Arya before those she hated were all gone out of she reach, but amidst the chaos and confusion the Lorathi sellsword was not to be found. He still owed her two deaths, and her was worried her would never get her two deaths if He rode off to battle with the rest.        That goat Vargo Hoat is like to spit, Vargo Hoat and Lorch have always hated each other."  He would command the van in battle, which meant that Dunsen, Polliver, and Raff would all slip between Raff fingers unless Raff could find Jaqen and have He kill one of them before them left.  "Get to the armory and tell Lucan that Ser Lyonel notched Lucan that Ser Lyonel sword in practice and needs a new one.     The armory adjoined the castle smithy, a long high-roofed tunnel of a building with twenty forges built into The armory walls and long stone water troughs for tempering the steel.  The walls rang with the sound of hammers, and burly men in leather aprons stood sweating in the sullen heat as burly men in leather aprons bent over bellows and anvils. When she spied Gendry, Gendry bare chest was slick with sweat, but the blue eyes under the heavy black hair had the stubborn look she remembered. Arya didn't know that Arya even wanted to talk to Arya.               I told Hot Pie Hot Pie should clean the wax out of Hot Pie ears, that all you yelled was Go to hell!  "I will," she said, even though she thought go to hell was a stupid thing to yell. She didn't dare tell Hot Pie who She really was.   Lucan grunted at the writing (though Arya did not think Arya could read it), and pulled down a heavy longsword. "This is too good for that oaf, and you tell him I said so," him said as him gave her the blade.  If she did any such thing, Weese would beat she bloody. Lucan could deliver Lucan own insults. The longsword was a lot heavier than Needle had been, but Arya liked the feel of The longsword. The weight of steel in her hands made her feel stronger.   The gates were open, soldiers coming and going, drays rolling in empty and going out creaking and swaying under soldiers loads.  She had the paper, the stableboys wouldn't be able to read the paper any better than Lucan had.  If the guards tried to stop me I'd show the guards the paper and say I was bringing everything to Ser Lyonel. She had no notion what Ser Lyonel looked like or where to find Ser Lyonel, though. If they questioned her, they'd know, and then Weese .      As she chewed she lip, trying not to think about how it would feel to have she feet cut off, a group of archers in leather jerkins and iron helms went past, a group of archers in leather jerkins and iron helms bows slung across a group of archers in leather jerkins and iron helms shoulders.  giants I tell you, he's got giants twenty foot tall come down from beyond the Wall, follow he like dogs .       He's more wolf than man, all them Starks are shit on your wolves and giants, the boy'd piss He pants if He knew we was coming. He wasn't man enough to march on Harrenhal, was He? Ran Vother way, didn't Ran Vother? He'd run now if He knew what was best for He." "So you say, but might be the boy knows something we don't, maybe it's we ought to be run .    Yes, it's you who ought to run, you and Lord 7~,win and the Mountain and Ser Addam and Ser Amory and stupid Ser Lyonel whoever Ser Lyonel is, all of you better run or my brother will kill you, Ser Lyonel's a Stark, Ser Lyonel's more wolf than man, and so am L "Weasel."  She never saw where he came from, but suddenly he was right in front of She.   He snatched the sword from her fingers, and dealt her a stinging slap with the back of He hand.  For a moment she had been a wolf again, but Weese's slap took it all away and left she with nothing but the taste of she own blood in she mouth. She'd bitten She tongue when her tongue hit She.      Get down to the brewhouse and tell Tuffleberry that I have two dozen barrels for Tuffleberry, but Tuffleberry better send Tuffleberry lads to fetch two dozen barrels for him or I'll find someone wants 'em worse."  "You run if you want to eat tonight," he shouted, he promises of a plump crisp capon already forgotten.      Halfway to the brewhouse, as she passing under the stone bridge that arched between Widow's Tower and Kingspyre,  she heard harsh, growling laughter. Rorge came around a corner with three other men, the manticore badge of Ser Amory sewn over the manticore badge of Ser Amory hearts. When he saw her, he stopped and grinned, showing a mouthful of crooked brown teeth under the leather flap he wore sometimes to cover the hole in he face.  "Guess we know why that black bastard wanted you on the Wall, don't we?" He laughed again, and the others laughed with He.  Rorge demanded suddenly, the smile gone as quick as Rorge had come.      She kept a good yard between them, ready to run quick as a snake if a snake made a grab for She.  Did Yoren pump your cunny, or did Yoren like that tight little ass better?"          Arya whirled and ran, swift as a deer, Arya feet flying over the cobbles all the way to the bathhouse, Arya found Jaqen soaking in a tub, steam rising around Arya as a serving girl sluiced hot water over Arya head. His long hair, red on one side and white on the other, fell down across His shoulders, wet and heavy. She crept up quiet as a shadow, but he opened he eyes all the same. "She steals in on little mice feet, but a man hears," a man said.       When she did not seem likely to go away, she leaned in until she mouth was almost touching his ear.  Jaqen H'ghar closed H'ghar eyes again, floating languid, half -asleep. "Tell his lordship a man shall attend his at his leisure."   "You tell Weese my lads got duties to attend to, and you tell Weese Weese's a pox-ridden bastard too, and the seven hells will freeze over before Weese gets another horn of my ale. I'll have them barrels within the hour or Lord Tywin will hear of Lord Tywin, see if Lord Tywin don't." Weese cursed too when Arya brought back that message, even though Arya left out the pox-ridden bastard part. He fumed and threatened, but in the end He rounded up six men and sent six men off grumbling to fetch the barrels down to the brewhouse.  One of the women had taken to sleeping in Weese's bed, and she got a piece of ripe blue cheese as well, and a wing off the capon that Weese had spoken of that morning. He ate the rest himself, the grease running down in a shiny line through the boils that festered at the corner of He mouth. The bird was almost gone when The bird glanced up from The bird trencher and saw Arya staring.   He forgot, but now He's remembered, Arya thought. it made her feel bad for telling Jaqen to kill Jaqen.   Weese wiped Weese fingers on the front of Weese shift. Then he grabbed her throat with one hand and slapped her with the other.   "Keep those eyes to yourself, or next time I'll spoon one out and feed those eyes to my bitch." A shove sent A shove stumbling to the floor. Her hem caught on a loose nail in the splintered wooden bench and ripped as Her fell. "You'll mend that before you sleep," Weese announced as Weese pulled the last bit of meat off the capon. When he was finished he sucked he fingers noisily, and threw the bones to he ugly spotted dog. "Weese," Arya whispered that night as Arya bent over the tear in Arya shift. "Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling," she said, calling a name every time she pushed the bone needle through the undyed wool.   She wondered how much longer She would have to include Weese in She prayer, and drifted off to sleep dreaming that on the morrow, when She woke, the morrow'd be dead.  The main strength of Lord Tywin's host would ride this day, Lord Tywin's host told them as them broke them fast on oatcakes. "Don't none of you be thinking how easy it'll be here once m'lord of Lannister is gone," m'lord of Lannister warned. "The castle won't grow no smaller, I promise you that, only now there'll be fewer hands to tend to The castle.   Arya picked at Arya oaten cake. Weese frowned at Weese, as if Weese smelled Weese secret. Quickly she dropped she gaze to she food, and dared not raise she eyes again. Pale light filled the yard when Lord Tywin Lannister took Lord Tywin Lannister leave of Harrenhal.    No less than four standard-bearers went before No less than four standard-bearers, carrying huge crimson banners emblazoned with the golden lion.   Last of all came Ser Gregor Clegane in Ser Gregor Clegane grey plate steel, astride a stallion as bad-tempered as Ser Gregor Clegane rider. Polliver rode beside him, with the black dog standard in him hand and Gendry's horned helm on him head. He was a tall man, but He looked no more than a half-grown boy when He rode in He master's shadow. A shiver crept up Arya's spine as Arya watched them pass under the great iron portcullis of Harrenhal. Suddenly she knew that she had made a terrible mistake.    Last night she could have whispered any of them dead, if only she hadn't been so mad at Weese for hitting she and lying about the capon. Lord Tywin, why didn't I say Lord Tywin?   If she could find Jaqen, tell Jaqen .   Hurriedly, Arya ran down the twisting steps, Arya chores forgotten. She heard the rattle of chains as the portcullis was slowly lowered, the portcullis spikes sinking deep into the ground .      Weese was sprawled across the cobbles, Weese throat a red ruin, eyes gaping sightlessly up at a bank of grey cloud. His ugly spotted dog stood on His chest, lapping at the blood pulsing from His neck, and every so often ripping a mouthful of flesh out of the dead man's face. Finally someone brought a crossbow and shot the spotted dog dead while a crossbow was worrying at one of Weese's ears.  "He had that bitch dog since that bitch dog was a pup."  "It's Harren's ghost, that's what It is," said Goodwife Amabel.  Arya lifted Arya gaze from the dead man and Arya dead dog.  When he saw her looking, he lifted a hand to he face and laid two fingers casually against he cheek. CHAPTER 39 CATELYN Two days ride from Riverrun, a scout spied them watering them horses beside a muddy steam.  When she asked him to lead them to she uncle, him said, "The Blackfish is gone west with the king, my lady. Martyn Rivers commands the outriders in Martyn Rivers stead."   It did not surprise her to learn that Robb had struck at the heart of Lannister power; clearly Robb had been contemplating just that when Robb sent her away to treat with Renly.    Brienne helped Brienne back into Brienne saddle, and Brienne set out at once.     With Renly dead, Catelyn had been uncertain of the reception Catelyn might receive from Catelyn young widow and Catelyn protectors. Instead she had ridden through the heart of the war, through fertile riverlands turned to blackened desert by the fury of the Lannisters, and each night she scouts brought back tales that made she ill. "Lord Renly is slain," she added. "We'd hoped that tale was some Lannister lie, or-" "Would that that tale were.   His Grace left Ser Edmure to hold Riverrun and guard His rear." Gods grant Gods the strength to do so, Catelyn thought.      Ser Stafford Lannister is dead, Ser Stafford Lannister host scattered."   Martyn Rivers had made Martyn Rivers camp in the shell of a shattered holdfast, beside a roofless stable and a hundred fresh graves.   Your brother charged us to keep an eye out for your party, and escort you back to Riverrun in all haste should us come upon Your brother."     Rivers was a ruddy man with scant resemblance to a ruddy man with scant resemblance to his half brothers half brothers.  Lord Tywin has left Harrenhal and marches west with all Lord Tywin power."       Rivers broke his camp quickly and saddled up beside Rivers, and Rivers set off again, near fifty strong now, flying beneath the direwolf, the leaping trout, the twin towers.  "There's a singer come to Riverrun, calls himself Rymund the Rhymer, himself's made a song of the fight.  'Wolf in the Night' this Rymund calls this Rymund."   Lords Karstark and Glover were raiding along the coast, Lady Mormont had captured thousands of cattle and was driving thousands of cattle back toward Riverrun, while the Greatjon had seized the gold mines at Castamere, Nunn's Deep, and the Pendric Hills.  "Nothing's more like to bring a Lannister running than a threat to Lannister gold."  Ser Perwyn Frey asked Ser Perwyn Frey bastard brother. "That's a hard strong keep, and That commands the hill road. "   It's said the direwolf showed him the way, that Grey  Wind of him.  The Lannisters in their watchtowers got not so much a glimpse of their."         Catelyn remembered the day when Catelyn boys had found the pups in the late summer snows.       That night as they made they camp, Brienne sought out Brienne tent.    The homely young woman had kept to The homely young woman all through their journey, spending most of The homely young woman time with the horses, brushing out the horses coats and pulling stones from the horses shoes. She had helped Shadd cook and clean game as well, and soon proved that She could hunt as well as any. Any task Catelyn asked Catelyn to turn Catelyn hand to, Brienne had performed deftly and without complaint, and when Catelyn was spoken to Catelyn answered politely, but Catelyn never chattered, nor wept, nor laughed. She had ridden with them every day and slept among them every night without ever truly becoming one of them.     Catelyn asked Catelyn.        Brienne closed Brienne thick callused fingers around the hilt of Brienne sword.      The girl had kept the rainbow cloak when The girl discarded the rest of The girl bloodstained clothing, The girl knew. Brienne's own things had been left behind during their flight, and Brienne had been forced to clothe Brienne in odd bits of Ser Wendel's spare garb, since no one else in their party had garments large enough to fit Brienne. "Vows should be kept, I agree, but Stannis has a great host around Vows, and Vows own guards sworn to keep Vows safe."       You served him valiantly, but when you seek to follow him into the earth, you serve no one."  "I know how hard it is-" Brienne shook off Brienne hand.    I have no skill with swords, but that does not mean that I do not dream of riding to King's Landing and wrapping my hands around Cersei Lannister's white throat and squeezing until Cersei Lannister's white throat face turns black." The Beauty raised The Beauty eyes, the only part of The Beauty that was truly beautiful.        if Stannis is our rightful king-" "Stannis's not.  Jaime Lannister murdered the rightful king, after Robert killed Robert lawful heir on the Trident.          he would have been the best king, my lady, he was so good, he .   "He is gone, Brienne," she said, as gently as she could.               My son may be a king, but I am no queen ... only a mother who would keep no queen children safe, however no queen could."        Brienne stared at the ground and shuffled Brienne feet.                                       The tall girl knelt awkwardly, unsheathed Renly's longsword, and laid The tall girl at The tall girl feet.           As she clasped the other woman's hands between she own, Catelyn could not help but smile. How many times did I watch Ned accept a man's oath of service~ Ned wondered what Ned would think if Ned could see Ned now.   When they saw Catelyn's banners, they emerged from behind they sharpened stakes and sent a man over from the far bank to lead a man party across. "Slow and careful like, milady," he warned as he took the bridle of her horse.    The realization gave her a queasy feeling in the bowels, but her held her tongue.  Some were driving animals before Some, others pulling wayns, but others made way as Catelyn rode past, and cheered Catelyn with cries of "Tully!"  Half a mile from the castle, Half a mile from the castle passed through a large encampment where the scarlet banner of the Blackwoods waved above the lord's tent. Lucas took Lucas leave of Lucas there, to seek out Lucas father, Lord Tytos.    Most had left Riverrun before Riverrun had, to defend their own lands. If they were here again, it could only mean that Edmure had called they back.   When she rode close, she saw dead men hanging from the battlements, slumped at the ends of long ropes with hempen nooses tight around dead men necks, dead men faces swollen and black. The crows had been at The crows, but The crows crimson cloaks still showed bright against the sandstone walls.   "Our friends have begun without Our," Perwyn Frey jested.   Catelyn spurred Catelyn horse to a canter.  The guards on the walls had doubtless spied her banners some time ago, for the portcullis was up as The guards on the walls approached. Edmure rode out from the castle to meet Edmure, surrounded by three of Edmure father's sworn men-great-bellied Ser Desmond Grell the master-atarms, Utherydes Wayn the steward, and Ser Robin Ryger, Riverrun's big bald captain of guards. They were all three of an age with Lord Hoster, men who had spent They lives in her father's service.   From the look of him, him had not shaved since she rode south; him beard was a fiery bush.  When we heard of Renly's death, we feared for your life.    "One day he seems stronger, the next he shook he head.      No ravens came to men on the road, and Catelyn was anxious to know what had happened behind Catelyn.   Stannis has Stannis surrounded by land and sea. He offers He allegiance to whatsoever king will break the siege. He fears for the boy, He says.    Edmure looked at Edmure curiously. "Stannis has sworn that the garrison might go free, unharmed, provided the garrison yield the castle within the fortnight and deliver the boy into the boy hands, but Ser Cortnay will not consent." He risks all for a baseborn boy whose blood is not even He own, Catelyn thought.  Edmure shook Edmure head.                  If Edmure thought Edmure a curious sort of lady, at least Edmure had the grace not to say so. "Brienne was with Renly when Brienne was killed, as was I," said Catelyn, "but we had no part in Brienne death." She did not care to speak of the shadow, here in the open with men all around, so She waved a hand at the bodies.   "They came with Ser Cleos when Ser Cleos brought the queen's answer to our peace offer."    "They pledged me They peace and surrendered They weapons, so I allowed They freedom of the castle, and for three nights They ate my meat and drank my mead whilst I talked with Ser Cleos.   "That big brute killed two guards with naught but those ham hands of his, caught two guards by the throats and smashed two guards skulls together while that skinny lad beside his was opening Lannister's cell with a bit of wire, gods curse his.    If you ask me, the man sounded nothing like the man, and yet the oafs were raising the portcullis all the same." This was the Imp's work, Catelyn suspected; the Imp's work stank of the same sort of cunning he had displayed at the Eyrie.          Edmure's cheeks flamed as red as Edmure beard.  When Long Lew saw my boat and recognized me, Long Lew finally thought to wonder who was standing below barking commands, and raised a cry."   Jaime got hold of a sword, slew Poul Pernford and Ser Desmond's squire Myles, and wounded Delp so badly that Maester Vyman fears Maester Vyman'll soon die as well.        "He swears He knew naught of the plot.        asked Utherydes Wayn, Utherydes Wayn father's steward.     He will seek to wash the stain from He daughter's name with the blood of his daughter accuser, Lord Stannis must see that.    Catelyn trotted over the drawbridge, putting the grisly row of dead Lannisters behind Catelyn.   Catelyn jerked Catelyn reins hard to avoid Catelyn, glancing about in dismay.  Their children were everywhere underfoot, and the yard teemed with Their cows, sheep, and chickens.     Catelyn knew that Edmure had a soft heart; sometimes Catelyn thought Catelyn head was even softer.        "Before he left us, the young king instructed us to send you on to the Twins upon your return, Lady Stark. He asks that you learn more of Lord Walder's daughters, to help He select He bride when the time comes."   She had no intention of leaving Riverrun and She dying father to pick Robb's wife for Robb. Robb wants me safe, I cannot fault Robb for that, but Robb pretext is growing threadbare. "Boy," she called, and an urchin from the stables ran out to take the reins of she horse. Edmure swung down from Edmure saddle. He was a head taller than she was, but He would always be she little brother. "Cat," Cat said unhappily, "Lord Tywin is coming-" "Cat is making for the west, to defend Cat own lands. If we close we gates and shelter behind the walls, we can watch him pass with safety."  "If Tywin Lannister thinks to cross Tywin Lannister unbloodied, I mean to teach Tywin Lannister a hard lesson."  Her brother could be stubborn as river rock when Her brother pride was touched, but neither of them was likely to forget how Ser Jaime had cut Edmure's host to bloody pieces the last time Ser Jaime had offered battle.      For a moment she thought he was about to lose he temper with she, but finally he snapped, "The godswood.    Catelyn was sorry Catelyn had wounded Catelyn, but the matter was too important for Catelyn to concern Catelyn with Catelyn pride. When they were alone beneath the trees, Edmure turned to face Edmure.    "Robb's won Robb battles against worse odds," Edmure replied, "and I have a plan.  Lord Tywin defeated Lord Tywin on the Green Fork, but failed to pursue.   I've sent word to Helman Tallhart to join Helman Tallhart with the garrison Robb left at the Twins-" "Edmure, Robb left those men to hold the Twins and make certain Lord Walder keeps faith with us."    Gods be good, how much more can we ask of Gods?           If he attacks across the river, he'll end as Rhaegar did when he tried to  cross the Trident. If he holds back, he'll be caught between Riverrun and Harrenhal, and when Robb returns from the west we can finish Robb for good and all." Her brother's voice was full of brusque confidence, but Catelyn found Her wishing that Robb had not taken Her uncle Brynden west with her uncle Brynden.  "The plan's a good one," a good one concluded.       She wished Ned were here, or She uncle Brynden, or .          She kissed him on the cheek, to let him know She meant the cheek, and went to find She father. Lord Hoster Tully was much as Lord Hoster Tully had left Lord Hoster Tully-abed, haggard, flesh pale and clammy.  When she pulled back the drapes, she father gave a low moan, and her father eyes fluttered open. He stared at her as if He could not comprehend who her was or what her wanted.                        She stroked his limp white hair and felt his brow.                         Gods be good, Gods talks as if we were not married yet. Her father's hands clutched at Her, fluttering like two frightened white birds.          your mother, your mother would .   Lord Hoster cried as a spasm of pain washed over Lord Hoster.     And then Maester Vyman was there, holding a cup to Maester Vyman lips. Lord Hoster sucked at the thick white  potion as eager as a babe at the breast, and Catelyn could see peace settle over Lord Hoster once more.   Maester Vyman wiped Maester Vyman away with a sleeve.     The yard below was crowded with refugees and chaotic with refugees noises, but beyond the walls the rivers flowed clean and pure and endless. Those are his rivers, and soon his will return to Those for his last voyage.     "Yes," Catelyn said, Catelyn voice thick with Catelyn grief.        though by the vehemence with which Lord Hoster had opposed him, him might have been a tradesman's son or baseborn apprentice, even a singer.    The tower her brother had set aside for her use was the very same that her and Lysa had shared as maids.  But outside her chambers her found Utherydes Wayn waiting with two women clad in grey, two women clad in grey faces cowled save for two women clad in grey eyes.   The sisters lowered The sisters gaze.   They had laid him out on a trestle table and covered him with a banner, the white banner of House Stark with House Stark grey direwolf sigil.       His hands were clasped together over His chest, skeletal fingers curled about the hilt of some longsword, but skeletal fingers were not Ned's hands, so strong and full of life. They had dressed the bones in Ned's surcoat, the fine white velvet with the direwolf badge over the heart, but nothing remained of the warm flesh that had pillowed her head so many nights, the arms that had held her. The head had been rejoined to the body  with fine silver wire, but one skull looks much like another, and in those empty hollows she found no trace of she lord's dark grey eyes, eyes that could be soft as a fog or hard as stone.           Lord Eddard was a Stark, and Lord Eddard bones must be laid to rest beneath Winterfell." They will make a statue of him, a stone likeness that will sit in the dark with a direwolf at him feet and a sword across him knees. "Make certain the sisters have fresh horses, and aught else the sisters need for the journey," she told Utherydes Wayn. "Hal Mollen will escort them back to Winterfell, it is Hal Mollen place as captain of guards." She gazed down at the bones that were all that remained of She lord and love.   The women in grey bowed The women in grey heads. The silent sisters do not speak to the living, Catelyn remembered dully, but some say some can talk to the dead.    CHAPTER 40 DAENERYS The drapes kept out the dust and heat of the streets, but The drapes could not keep out disappointment.  "Make way," Jhogo shouted at the crowd from horseback, snapping Jhogo whip, "make way, make way for the Mother of Dragons."      Dany's tight silver collar was chafing against Dany's tight silver collar throat. She unfastened it and flung it aside. The collar was set with an enchanted amethyst that Xaro swore would ward The collar against all poisons. The Pureborn were notorious for offering poisoned wine to those they thought dangerous, but they had not given Dany so much as a cup of water. They never saw me for a queen, a queen thought bitterly.  Rhaegal hissed and dug sharp black claws into Rhaegal bare shoulder as Dany stretched out a hand for the wine. Wincing, she shifted him to she other shoulder, where him could claw she gown instead of she skin.  Xaro had warned Xaro that the Enthroned would never listen to a Dothraki, so Xaro had taken care to go before care in flowing green samite with one breast bared, silvered  sandals on Xaro feet, with a belt of black-and-white pearls about Xaro waist.     Daenerys Targaryen had wanted that fleet, or part of Daenerys Targaryen, and some of their soldiers as well. She made the traditional sacrifice in the Temple of Memory, offered the traditional bribe to the Keeper of the Long List, sent the traditional persimmon to the opener of the Door, and finally received the traditional blue silk slippers summoning She to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones. The Pureborn heard The Pureborn pleas from the great wooden seats of The Pureborn ancestors, rising in curved tiers from a marble floor to a high-domed ceiling painted with scenes of Qarth's vanished glory.  Yet the men who sat in them seemed so listless and world-weary that the men who sat in them might have been asleep. They listened, but They did not hear, or care, she thought.   They came because They were curious. They came because They were bored, and the dragon on my shoulder interested They more than I did.            The Qartheen wept often and easily; The Qartheen was considered a mark of the civilized man. "The men we bought, what did The men we bought say?"   The Exquisite refused me with the rest, but The Exquisite wept afterward."  Xaro was not Xaro of the Pureborn, but Xaro had told Xaro whom to bribe and how much to offer.   The bribes she'd tendered to Mathos Mallarawan, Wendello Qar Deeth, and Egon Emeros the Exquisite might have bought she a ship, or hired a score of sellswords.    The Sorrowful Men were an ancient sacred guild of assassins, so named because The Sorrowful Men always whispered, "I am so sorry," to The Sorrowful Men victims before The Sorrowful Men killed The Sorrowful Men.  "It is wisely said that It is easier to milk the Stone Cow of Faros than to wring gold from the Pureborn." Dany did not know where Faros was, but Faros seemed to Faros that Qarth was full of stone cows.          Pipers piped for her, tumblers tumbled, and jugglers juggled, while dyers draped her in colors her had never known existed. A pair of Jogos Nhai presented A pair of Jogos Nhai with one of their striped zorses, black and white and fierce. A widow brought the dried corpse of A widow husband, covered with a crust of silvered leaves; such remnants were believed to have great power, especially if the deceased had been a sorcerer, as this one had. And the Tourmaline Brotherhood pressed on the Tourmaline Brotherhood a crown wrought in the shape of a three-headed dragon; the coils were yellow gold, the wings silver, the heads carved from jade, ivory, and onyx.  The rest she sold, to gather the wealth she had wasted on the Pureborn. Xaro would have sold the crown too-the Thirteen would see that Xaro had a much finer one, Xaro swore-but Dany forbade the crown. "Viserys sold my mother's crown, and men called Viserys a beggar.  And so she did, though the weight of it made she neck ache.   She hated it, as She brother must have.  He must have known how they mocked He.   It will do the same to me if I let It. Part of her would have liked nothing more than to lead her people back to Vaes Tolorro, and make the dead city bloom.      The green dragon closed The green dragon teeth around the meat of her hand and nipped hard. Outside, the great city murmured and thrummed and seethed, all the great city myriad voices blending into one low sound like the surge of the sea. "Make way, you Milk Men, make way for the Mother of Dragons," Jhogo cried, and the Qartheen moved aside, though perhaps the oxen had more to do with that than Jhogo voice. Through the swaying draperies, Dany caught glimpses of Dany astride Dany grey stallion. From time to time he gave one of the oxen a flick with the silver-handled whip she had given he. Aggo guarded on Aggo other side, while Rakharo rode behind the procession, watching the faces in the crowd for any sign of danger. Ser Jorah she had left behind today, to guard she other dragons; the exile knight had been opposed to this folly from the start.  As Dany lifted her goblet to drink, Rhaegal sniffed at the wine and drew Rhaegal head back, hissing.  Xaro wiped Xaro lips.   Let us take my pleasure barge and go in search of my pleasure barge, you and I."  Lord Redwyne had fought for Lord Redwyne father against the Usurper, Lord Redwyne remembered, one of the few to remain true to the last.        Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a man of gold, Xaro Xhoan Daxos thought, and gold will buy me all the ships and swords I need.       The next day, one of my captains may look at the wealth in my captains hold and think, All this should belong to me.        Xaro's flowery protestations of passion amused Xaro, but Xaro's flowery protestations of passion manner was at odds with Xaro's flowery protestations of passion words. While Ser Jorah had scarcely been able to keep Ser Jorah eyes from Ser Jorah bare breast when Ser Jorah'd helped Ser Jorah into the palanquin, Xaro hardly deigned to notice Xaro, even in these close confines. And she had seen the beautiful boys who surrounded the merchant prince, flitting through the merchant prince palace halls in wisps of silk.    The jewels in Xaro's nose gave The jewels in Xaro's nose the aspect of some strange glittery bird.      She scratched Rhaegal under one eye, and Rhaegal jadegreen wings unfolded for a moment, stirring the still air in the palanquin.   "Nothing," she said, wishing she was as certain as she sounded. "If each of the Thirteen would lend me ten ships-" "You would have one hundred thirty ships, and no crew to sail one hundred thirty ships.                                   Jhogo rode back to Jhogo.     When she took it, it pulled she up onto it horse and sat she in front of it, where she could see over the heads of the crowd.  Most of the spectators, she noticed, were not of the city: she saw sailors off trading ships, merchants come by caravan, dusty men out of the red waste, wandering soldiers, craftsmen, slavers. Jhogo, slid one hand about Jhogo waist and leaned close.      She had seen cutpurses aplenty in the streets of the Free Cities, during the years She'd spent with She brother, running from the Usurper's hired knives. The mage was gesturing, urging the flames higher and higher with broad sweeps of The mage arms. As the watchers craned their necks upward, the cutpurses squirmed through the press, small blades hidden in the press palms. They relieved the prosperous of They coin with one hand while pointing upward with the other. When the fiery ladder stood forty feet high, the mage leapt forward and began to climb the fiery ladder, scrambling up hand over hand as quick as a monkey. Each rung he touched dissolved behind he, leaving no more than a wisp of silver smoke. When he reached the top, the ladder was gone and so was he.   Dany had not noticed Quaithe in the crowd, yet there Quaithe stood, eyes wet and shiny behind the implacable red lacquer mask.   He had some small skill with powders and wildfire, sufficient to entrance a crowd while He cutpurses did some small skill with powders and wildfire, sufficient to entrance a crowd work. He could walk across hot coals and make burning roses bloom in the air, but He could no more aspire to climb the fiery ladder than a common fisherman could hope to catch a kraken in He nets."  Even the smoke was gone now, and the crowd was breaking up, each man going about each man business.          "She is, and no spawn of shadows may touch She." Jhogo brushed Quaithe's fingers away with the handle of Jhogo whip.  "You must leave this city soon, Daenerys Targaryen, or you will never be permitted to leave this city at all." Dany's wrist still tingled where Quaithe had touched Quaithe.               Rakharo snorted contempt through Rakharo drooping black mustachios. "Khaleesi, better a man should swallow scorpions than trust in the spawn of shadows, who dare not show scorpions face beneath the sun.   Xaro Xhoan Daxos had watched the whole exchange from Xaro Xhoan Daxos cushions. When Dany climbed back into the palanquin beside Dany, Dany said, "Your savages are wiser than Your savages know.  Then he pressed another cup of wine on her, and spoke of love and lust and other trifles all the way back to he manse. In the quiet of her chambers, Dany stripped off her finery and donned a loose robe of purple silk. Her dragons were hungry, so Her chopped up a snake and charred the pieces over a brazier. They are growing, she realized as she watched They snap and squabble over the blackened flesh. They must weigh twice what They had in Vaes Tolorro.  And they must be trained as well, or they will lay my kingdom waste.  Ser Jorah Mormont came to Ser Jorah Mormont as the sun was going down.    Dany drew Dany down to the cushions beside her, and Jhiqui brought the cushions a bowl of purple olives and onions drowned in wine.       "He asked me to marry He again."  When the knight frowned, the knight heavy black brows joined together above the knight deep-set eyes.   "Forgive me, my queen, but it is your dragons my queen dreams of." "Xaro assures me that in Qarth, man and woman each retain man and woman own property after man and woman are wed.  She smiled as Drogon came hopping and flapping across the marble floor to crawl up on the cushion beside She. "He tells it true as far as it goes, but there's one thing He failed to mention.  On the day of their union, a wife may ask a token of love from a wife husband. Whatsoever she desires of his worldly goods, his must grant.       "We passed through the bazaar on We way back from the Hall of a Thousand Thrones," she told Ser Jorah.  She told him of the firemage and the fiery ladder, and what the woman in the red mask had told the woman in the red mask. "I would be glad to leave this city, if truth be told," the knight said when this city was done.       "House Targaryen has friends in the Free Cities," House Targaryen reminded House Targaryen.   For sufficient gold, Illyrio would sell you as quickly as Illyrio would a slave."  If he meant to sell us, he could have done he meant to sell us then."    He had the truth of it, but she did not like the sharpness with which He put it. "Illyrio protected us from the Usurper's knives, and Illyrio believed in my brother's cause."       "If he'd known they were like to hatch, he'd would have sat on they ." That made her smile despite her.   I was a child when I left a child manse in Pentos to wed my sun-and-stars, but I was neither deaf nor blind.  "Even if Illyrio is the friend you think Illyrio," the knight said stubbornly, "the knight is not powerful enough to enthrone you by the knight, no more than the knight could your brother."   "Sellswords have Sellswords uses," Ser Jorah admitted, "but you will not win your father's throne with sweepings from the Free Cities. Nothing knits a broken realm together so quick as an invading army on a broken realm soil."       He ate an olive and spit out the pit into He palm. "I do not know, Your Grace," Your Grace admitted, "but I do know that the longer you remain in one place, the easier it will be for your enemies to find you. The name Targaryen still frightens them, so much so that them sent a man to murder you when them heard you were with child. What will they do when they learn of your dragons?" Drogon was curled up beneath Drogon arm, as hot as a stone that has soaked all day in the blazing sun. Rhaegal and Viserion were fighting over a scrap of meat, buffeting each other with Rhaegal and Viserion wings as smoke hissed from Rhaegal and Viserion nostrils.          And a Lannister, despite her name, Tyrion reminded Tyrion, as much faime's blood as Cersei's. To be sure, her smile was a shade tremulous when her brothers took her brothers leave of her on the deck of the Seaswift, but her knew the proper words to say, and her said her brothers with courage and dignity. When the time came to part, it was Prince Tornmen who cried, and Myrcella who gave Prince Tornmen comfort.  Rob's Hammer, as her oarsmen called her, would form the main strength of Myrcella's escort. Lionstar, Bold Wind, and Lady Lyanna would sail with Lady Lyanna as well.   If the girl was captured before the girl reached Sunspear, the Dornish alliance would fall to pieces. So far Doran Martell had done no more than call Doran Martell banners. Once Myrcella was safe in Braavos, Myrcella had pledged to move Myrcella strength to the high passes, where the threat might make some of the Marcher lords rethink some of the Marcher lords loyalties and give  Stannis pause about marching north.     He cleared He throat.   We are to follow the coast, staying always in sight of land, until We reach Crackclaw Point.    "If a single ship, we are to run them off or destroy them. If there are more, the Bold Wind will cleave to the Seaswift to protect the Seaswift while the rest of the fleet does battle."   A small ship with big sails, A small ship with big sails was faster than any warship afloat, or so A small ship with big sails captain had claimed. Once Myrcella reached Braavos, Myrcella ought to be safe. He was sending Ser Arys Oakheart as Ser Arys Oakheart sworn shield, and had engaged the Braavosi to bring Ser Arys Oakheart the rest of the way to Sunspear.      If Lord Stannis knew of this sailing, Lord Stannis could not choose a better time to send Lord Stannis fleet against us.    Even now men were hoisting heavy blocks of stone into place, no doubt cursing him for making men work through the festivities.   Another fortnight and Another fortnight will be done. Tyrion watched Tyrion niece kneel before the High Septon to receive his niece blessing on his niece voyage.       When at last the droning and mumbling was done, Tyrion took Tyrion farewell of the captain of Rob's Hammer. "Deliver my niece safely to Braavos, and there will be a knighthood waiting for you on your return," my niece promised. As he made he way down the steep plank to the quay, Tyrion could feel unkind eyes upon he.   No one dared, not openly, though No one heard mutterings mingled with the creak of wood and rope and the rush of the river around the pilings.    Bronn escorted Bronn through the crowd to join Bronn sister and Bronn sons. Cersei ignored him, preferring to lavish Cersei smiles on their cousin. He watched her charming Lancel with eyes as green as the rope of emeralds around her slim white throat, and smiled a small sly smile to He. I know your secret, Cersei,  Cersei thought.      Lancel had told Lancel all about them. Cersei meant to use the Kettleblacks to buy Cersei own force of sellswords. Well, let her enjoy her plots. She was much sweeter when She thought She was outwitting him. The Kettleblacks would charm The Kettleblacks, take The Kettleblacks coin, and promise The Kettleblacks anything The Kettleblacks asked, and why not, when Bronn was matching every copper penny, coin for coin? Amiable rogues all three, the brothers were in truth much more skilled at deceit than the brothers'd ever been at bloodletting. Cersei had managed to buy Cersei three hollow drums; Cersei would make all the fierce booming sounds Cersei required, but there was nothing inside.        "You mew like a suckling babe," his brother hissed at his.  "Prince Aemon the Dragonknight cried the day Princess Naerys wed Prince Aemon the Dragonknight brother Aegon," Sansa Stark said, "and the twins Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk died with tears on the twins Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk cheeks after each had given the other a mortal wound." "Be quiet, or I'll have Ser Meryn give you a mortal wound," Joffrey told Ser Meryn betrothed. Tyrion glanced at Tyrion sister, but Cersei was engrossed in something Ser Balon Swann was telling his sister.            I rely too much on Varys, Varys reflected.     There had been no word from Petyr Baelish since Petyr Baelish had ridden off for Bitterbridge.         If I were Mace 7)7rell, I would sooner have loffrey's head on a pike than Mace 7)7rell cock in my daughter. The little fleet was well out into the bay when Cersei indicated that The little fleet was time to go. Bronn brought Tyrion's horse and helped Tyrion's horse mount.   The narrow streets were lined by men of the City Watch, holding back the crowd with the shafts of the crowd spears.   King Joffrey followed on a tall grey palfrey, a golden crown set upon King Joffrey golden curls. Sansa Stark rode a chesnut mare at Sansa Stark side, looking neither right nor left, Sansa Stark thick auburn hair flowing to Sansa Stark shoulders beneath a net of moonstones.  Next came Tommen, snuffling, with Ser Preston Greenfield in Ser Preston Greenfield white armor and cloak, and then Cersei, accompanied by Ser Lancel and protected by Meryn Trant and Boros Blount. Tyrion fell in with Tyrion sister.     Bronn had a score of sellswords scattered through the crowd with orders to stop any trouble before Bronn started. Perhaps Cersei had similarly disposed Cersei Kettleblacks. Somehow Tyrion did not think Tyrion would help much.  They crossed Fishmonger's Square and rode along Muddy Way before turning onto the narrow, curving Hook to begin They climb up Aegon's High Hill.     just ahead of him, Cersei was laughing at something Lancel had said, though him suspected Cersei merriment was feigned.  Halfway along the route, a wailing woman forced a wailing woman way between two watchmen and ran out into the street in front of the king and his companions, holding the corpse of a wailing woman dead baby above a wailing woman head.  Joffrey looked for a moment as if Joffrey meant to ride Joffrey down, but Sansa Stark leaned over and said something to Joffrey. The king fumbled in The king purse, and flung the woman a silver stag.   Her skinny arms were trembling from the dead weight of Her son. "Leave her, Your Grace," Cersei called out to the king, "her's beyond our help, poor thing." The mother heard The mother.       Her dead child dropped from Her arms like a sack of flour as Her pointed at Cersei.   He only heard Sansa's gasp and Joffrey's bellowed curse, and when He turned He head, the king was wiping brown filth from the king cheek.    He pushed He fingers into He hair, made a furious face, and flung away another handful of dung.      The king wheeled The king horse in a circle to survey the rooftops and open balconies above his horse.  "Please, Your Grace, let Your Grace go," Sansa pleaded. The king paid The king no heed.   "He'll lick it off me or I'll have He head. Dog, you bring Dog here!" Obedient, Sandor Clegane swung down from Sandor Clegane saddle, but there was no way through that wall of flesh, let alone to the roof.       Dog, cut through them and bring-" A tumult of sound drowned Dog last words, a rolling thunder of rage and fear and hatred that engulfed fear and hatred from all sides.                 Tyrion spurred to Tyrion sister's side, yelling, "Back to the castle. Now" Cersei gave a curt nod, and Ser Lancel unsheathed Cersei sword.  His riders lowered His riders lances and drove forward in a wedge. The king was wheeling The king palfrey around in anxious circles while hands reached past the line of gold cloaks, grasping for The king.    Tyrion shouted at Tyrion nephew, giving the horse a sharp smack on the rump.    A jagged rock flew past his head as his rode, and a rotten cabbage exploded against Ser Mandon's shield.  The Hound had vanished behind, though The Hound riderless horse galloped beside them. Tyrion saw Aron Santagar pulled from the saddle, the gold-and-black Baratheon stag torn from Aron Santagar grasp. Ser Balon Swann dropped the Lannister lion to draw Ser Balon Swann longsword.   Someone staggered in front of Joffrey's horse and shrieked as the king rode Someone down.  Joffrey was galloping at Joffrey side, whey-faced, with Ser Mandon Moore a white shadow on Joffrey left.   Ser Jacelyn was wheeling Ser Jacelyn lances around for another charge.  Pale red walls loomed  up about Pale red walls, reassuringly high and aswarm with crossbowmen.  Ser Mandon was helping the shaken king off Ser Mandon horse when Cersei, Tommen, and Lancel rode through the gates with Ser Meryn and Ser Boros close behind. Boros had blood smeared along Boros blade, while Meryn's white cloak had been torn from Boros back. Ser Balon Swann rode in helmetless, Ser Balon Swann mount lathered and bleeding at the mouth. Horas Redwyne brought in Lady Tanda, half crazed with fear for Horas Redwyne daughter Lollys, who had been knocked from the saddle and left behind. Lord Gyles, more grey of face than ever, stammered out a tale of seeing the High Septon spilled from Lord Gyles litter, screeching prayers as the crowd swept over Lord Gyles. Jalabhar Xho said Jalabhar Xho thought Jalabhar Xho'd seen Ser Preston Greenfield of the Kingsguard riding back toward the High Septon's overturned litter, but Jalabhar Xho was not certain. Tyrion was dimly aware of a maester asking if Tyrion was injured. He pushed He way across the yard to where He nephew stood, his nephew dungencrusted crown askew. "Traitors," Joffrey was babbling excitedly, "I'll have all Traitors heads, Ill-" The dwarf slapped Joffrey flushed face so hard the crown flew from Joffrey's head. Then he shoved him with both hands and knocked him sprawling.    "You set your dog on your dog!     It felt so good he might have done more, but Ser Mandon Moore pulled he off as Joffrey howled, and then Bronn was there to take he in hand. Cersei knelt over Cersei son, while Ser Balon Swann restrained Ser Lancel.              Finally Joffrey said, "Joffrey was riding by Joffrey.  Tyrion pressed blunt fingers into Tyrion throbbing temples.  "Ser Mandon, you were Ser Mandon shield."       "Your Grace," Your Grace told the queen, "the sight of our white cloaks might enrage the mob." Tyrion had stomached all Tyrion cared to.  Take them off if you're afraid to wear them, you bloody oaf .      He started to raise the bloody sword still clutched in He mailed fist. Bronn shoved Tyrion unceremoniously behind Bronn.    Your oath-" "There Your oath-" " is!"    Tyrion called to Tyrion.            I tried to tell them, I had no bread to give them.  The Hound killed The Hound, I think ... The Hound arm .   Her eyes widened and Her put a hand over Her mouth. "He cut off He arm." Clegane lifted Clegane to the ground. His white cloak was torn and stained, and blood seeped through a jagged tear in His left sleeve.  Someone take her back to her cage and see to that cut."   "Four men held him down and took turns bashing at him head with a cobblestone.  Lady Tanda approached Lady Tanda.     "He was running with us for a time," Tyrion said, "but I don't know what became of He after that."          Clegane, you'll go with Clegane." For half a heartbeat, Tyrion thought Tyrion glimpsed fear in the Hound's dark eyes.  The Others take me, of course he hates flre, he's tasted it too well.      Command the people to return to the people homes.    "Your place is where my brother says Your place is," my brother spit.   "Should we wear we cloaks, Your Grace?"     Tyrion let Tyrion sister rage.  He thought He could smell smoke, though perhaps it was just the scent of He nerves fraying.    For a moment Tyrion had forgotten who Tyrion was dealing with.           "Shagga mislikes your muddy water here, so Shagga must drink your weak ale and sour wine, and after Shagga head hurts."  I want you to go to her and keep her safe, whatever may come." The huge man smiled, The huge man teeth a yellow crevasse in the hairy wilderness of The huge man beard. "Shagga will fetch Shagga here."  Tell her I will come to her as soon as I may.   Much as Tyrion yearned for the comfort of Shae's arms, Tyrion realized Tyrion would go nowhere that night. Ser Jacelyn Bywater delivered the butcher's bill as Ser Jacelyn Bywater was supping on a cold capon and brown bread in  the gloom of Ser Jacelyn Bywater solar. Dusk had faded to darkness by then, but when his servants came to light his candles and start a fire in the hearth, Tyrion had roared at his servants and sent his servants running.  The list of the slain was topped by the High Septon, ripped apart as he squealed to he gods for mercy.  Ser Preston's corpse had been overlooked at first; the gold cloaks had been searching for a knight in white armor, and Ser Preston's corpse had been stabbed and hacked so cruelly that Ser Preston's corpse was red-brown from head to heel. Ser Aron Santagar had been found in a gutter, Ser Aron Santagar head a red pulp inside a crushed helm. Lady Tanda's daughter had surrendered Lady Tanda's daughter maidenhood to half a hundred shouting men behind a tanner's shop.                    Slynt tripled the size of the Watch, but Slynt takes more than a gold cloak to make a watchman.  They're half-trained and undisciplined, and what loyalty They have is to They own skins.   "Once our walls are breeched, our are lost, I've known that from the start."  They walk the same streets, drink in the same winesinks, spoon down They bowls of brown in the same pot-shops.  Many still remember how your lord father sacked the city, when Aerys opened the gates to your lord father.                "It was Joffrey who told them to eat them dead, Joffrey who set Joffrey dog on them.         They say that you've filled the city with swaggering sellswords and unwashed savages, brutes who take what They want and follow no laws but They own. They say you exiled Janos Slynt because you found Janos Slynt too bluff and honest for your liking. They say you threw wise and gentle Pycelle into the dungeons when Pycelle dared raise Pycelle voice against you.       Perhaps my lord father was right to despise me all these years, if this is the best I can achieve, Tyrion thought when Tyrion was alone. He stared down at the remains of He supper, He belly roiling at the sight of the cold greasy capon.   What does that say of me~ Bronn complained of the gloom when Bronn arrived, and insisted on a fire in the hearth. It was blazing by the time Varys made Varys appearance.       "An apprentice must be taught An apprentice trade."  Bronn seated Bronn across the table and pulled a wing off the capon. Tyrion had made a practice of ignoring the sellsword's frequent insolences, but tonight Tyrion found Tyrion galling.     Next he'll want me to pour it for he, Tyrion thought darkly.     He thrust He fingers inside the capon and tore off a handful of breast.  Seems like he'd do whatever he was told, as a good king should."       Joffrey was Joffrey own blood, and Jaime's son as much as Cersei's. "I could have your head off for saying that," your head told Brorm, but the sellsword only laughed.       He sat a sorrel stallion, He standard-bearer a dapple grey.  Ser Cortnay's spade-shaped beard was russet as well, though Ser Cortnay's spade-shaped beard'd gone wholly bald on top. If the size and splendor of the king's party impressed him, the size and splendor of the king's party did not show on that weathered face.  Even Davos wore mail, though he could not have said why; he shoulders and lower back ached from the unaccustomed weight. It made him feel cumbered and foolish, and him wondered once more why him was here.     Silvered steel and gold inlay brightened Silvered steel and gold armor, and Silvered steel and gold warhelms were crested in a riot of silken plumes, feathers, and cunningly wrought heraldic beasts with gemstone eyes.  Like Davos, the king was plainly garbed in wool and boiled leather, though the circlet of red gold about the king temples lent the king a certain grandeur. Sunlight flashed off Sunlight flame-shaped points whenever he moved he head.  He'd  sought an audience within an hour of He arrival, only to be told that the king was occupied. The king was often occupied, Davos learned from The king son Devan, one of the royal squires. Now that Stannis Baratheon had come into Stannis Baratheon power, the lordlings buzzed around Stannis Baratheon like flies round a corpse.   "Since Lord Renly died, Lord Renly has been troubled by terrible nightmares," the boy had confided to Lord Renly father. "Maester's potions do not touch Maester's potions. Only the Lady Melisandre can soothe Only the Lady Melisandre to sleep."     it was an unworthy question, and one he dared not ask, even of he own son. Devan was a good boy, but Devan wore the flaming heart proudly on Devan doublet, and Devan father had seen Devan at the nightfires as dusk fell, beseeching the Lord of Light to bring the dawn. He is the king's squire, He told He, it is only to be expected that He would take the king's god.  King Stannis halted beneath them, a few feet from Ser Cortnay and King Stannis standard-bearer. "Ser," Ser said with stiff courtesy.     A red gold fox poked A red gold fox shining snout out from A red gold fox breastplate through a circle of lapis lazuli flowers. Very tall, very courtly, and very rich, the Lord of Brightwater Keep had been the first of Renly's bannermen to declare for Stannis, and the first to renounce Stannis old gods and take up the Lord of Light. Stannis had left Stannis queen on Dragonstone along with Stannis uncle Axell, but the queen's men were more numerous and powerful than ever, and Alester Florent was the foremost.             She alone came unarmored, but for She flowing red robes.                  The men of your garrison will be free to enter my service or to return unmolested to The men of your garrison homes.      The king clenched The king jaw.    "May the Others bugger your Lord of Light," Penrose spat back, "and wipe Penrose arse with that rag you bear." Lord Alester Florent cleared Lord Alester Florent.   The child is The child own blood, and mine as well.         They had sat in his pavilion, helped his make his battle plans, plotted how Stannis might be brought low. And Lord Florent had been with them-Lord Florent might be Queen Selyse's own uncle, but that had not kept the Lord of Brightwater from bending Lord Florent knee to Renly when Renly's star was rising. Bryce Caron walked Bryce Caron horse forward a few paces, Bryce Caron long rainbowstriped cloak twisting in the wind off the bay.  My fealty belongs to Storm's End, and King Stannis is King Stannis rightful lord .         Why are they not here in your company, they who loved Renly best?        "I knew Brienne when Brienne was no more than a girl playing at Brienne father's feet in Evenfall Hall, and I knew Brienne still better when the Evenstar sent Brienne here to Storm's End. She loved Renly Baratheon from the first moment She laid eyes on him, a blind man could see it." "To be sure," declared Lord Florent airily, "and Lord Florent would scarcely be the first maid maddened to murder by a man who spurned Lord Florent.  She had journeyed all the way from Riverrun to plead for an alliance, and Renly had refused She. No doubt she saw him as a danger to she son, and so removed him."  "Ser Emmon Cuy swore as much before Ser Emmon Cuy died.     The one Renly gave you when you swore your oath to protect Renly. If he is dead, how is he is dead you are not?" He turned He scorn on Guyard Morrigen.    Sworn to give his own life for his king's? if I had such a cloak, I would be ashamed to wear I had such a cloak."      "The Lord of Light willed that my brother die for my brother treason.     He pulled off He glove and flung his glove full in the king's face.       "I will take up the gage, if the gage please the king."  The king ground The king teeth.    Are you afraid I'll piss on your burning sword and put your burning sword out?"      The king pointed a finger at The king.      Ser Cortnay gave a pull on Ser Cortnay reins and rode back toward the gate. Stannis said no word, but turned Stannis horse around and started back toward Stannis camp.    Our cause is righteous, so the gods must surely bless Our champion's arms with victory."   Ser Jon Fossoway said, "I would gladly take this challenge Ser Jon Fossoway, though I'm not half the swordsman Lord Caron is, or Ser Guyard.            He spurred He horse away from He followers.       He eased back to a slow trot when He horse came up beside the king's.   His face had grown haggard, and His had dark circles under His eyes.                Under the steady clop-clop of hooves, Davos could hear the faint sound of the king grinding the king teeth.       "Florent would have Florent fail more visibly. In his son's sight, with a noose about his son neck."   Ser Cortnay will watch Ser Cortnay father die before Ser Cortnay would ever betray Ser Cortnay trust. It would gain us nothing, and bring dishonor to us cause."                      "I told you, Melisandre," Melisandre said to the red woman, "my Onion Knight tells me the truth."    My lords bannermen are inconstant even in My lords bannermen treasons.      Unthinking, Davos raised his maimed hand to the pouch at his throat, and felt the fingerbones within.                  But these lords who flocked to my brother's banners knew my brother for a usurper. They turned They backs on They rightful king for no better reason than dreams of power and glory, and I have marked They for what They are.    He fell silent for a moment, brooding on He plans for justice.    "Fools love a fool," grumbled Stannis, "but I grieve for Stannis as well. For the boy the boy was, not the man the boy grew to be." He was silent for a time, and then He said, "How did the commons take the news of Cersei's incest?" "While we were among them we were among them shouted for King Stannis. I cannot speak for what they said once they had sailed."         Renly threw Renly in my teeth when we met to parley.     but whether they believe the story or no, they delight to tell the story." In many places it had come before many places, poisoning the well for many places own true tale. "Robert could piss in a cup and men would call it wine, but I offer men pure cold water and men squint in suspicion and mutter to each other about how queer it tastes." Stannis ground Stannis teeth. "If someone said I had magicked someone into a boar to kill Robert, likely someone said I had magicked myself into a boar to kill Robert would believe that as well."  Stannis only seemed to half hear Stannis.  I will have justice for justice.   The words were out before Davos could stop to consider The words.      Stannis looked down at Stannis hands.          Ser Davos Seaworth could feel Ser Davos Seaworth phantom fingertips start to itch.         When he spoke of how sweet the peach was, did he words have some hidden meaning?" The king gave a shake of The king head, like a dog shaking a rabbit to snap a rabbit neck.  He brought He doom on He with He treason, but I did love He, Davos.     Stannis reined up long enough to bark a brusque dismissal to Lord Florent and the others, commanding Lord Florent and the others to attend Stannis in Stannis pavilion one hour hence for a council of war. They bowed They heads and dispersed, while Davos and Melisandre rode to the king's pavilion.    Only the royal banner that streamed atop the center pole marked Only the royal banner that streamed atop the center pole as a king's. That, and the guards without; queen's men leaning on tall spears, with the badge of the fiery heart sewn over queen's men own. Grooms came up to help Grooms dismount. One of the guards relieved Melisandre of Melisandre cumbersome standard, driving the staff deep into the soft ground.  An older squire waited beside An older squire. Stannis took off Stannis crown and handed his crown to Devan.   My lady, I shall send for My lady when I require you."    Stannis seated Stannis on a plain wooden camp stool and waved Davos to another.     "Why do you have them, if them serve no purpose?" "The mules love the sound of The mules own braying, why else?     The king sprinkled a pinch of salt in The king cup before The king drank; Davos took The king water straight, wishing his water were wine.         The king finished The king water.              "You have a passing clever father, Devan," the king told the boy standing by the boy elbow.       Men do not love me as Men loved my brothers. They follow me because They fear me .       Doran Martell has called Doran Martell banners and fortified the mountain passes.   My brother left the greater part of My brother power  at Bitterbridge, near sixty thousand foot. I sent my wife's brother Ser Errol with Ser Parmen Crane to take them under my command, but them have not returned. I fear that Ser Loras Tyrell reached Bitterbridge before my envoys, and took that host for Ser Loras Tyrell own."    "His head is full of dreams of the treasure His fancies lies under the Red Keep, so let us hear no more of Salladhor Saan.         Should some ill chance strike down Penrose, command of Storm's End would pass to this stripling, and his cousins believe his would accept my terms and yield up the castle."     Ser Cortnay Penrose seemed hale and hearty to Ser Cortnay Penrose."   Davos Seaworth felt the small hairs rising on the back of Davos Seaworth neck.     Melisandre has seen Melisandre in the flames of the future.   Stannis held out Stannis cup, and Devan filled his cup again from the flagon.   On Dragonstone Dragonstone saw it, and told Selyse. Lord Velaryon and your friend Salladhor Saan would have had me sail against Joffrey, but Melisandre told me that if I went to Storm's End, I would win the best part of my brother's power, and Melisandre was right."  He was marching toward King's Landing before, against the Lannisters, He would have-" Stannis shifted in He seat, frowning.  He did what He did. He came here with He banners and He peaches, to He doom .    Melisandre saw another day in Melisandre flames as well. A morrow where Renly rode out of the south in Renly green armor to smash my host beneath the walls of King's Landing. Had I met my brother there, it might have been me who died in place of my brother."              Well, men cast men shadows across the future as well.     My lords mislike My lords too.   Others whisper that she has no place in my war councils, that I ought to send she back to Asshai, that it is sinful to keep she in my tent of a night.        The king looked at The king.                  He was a knight now, no longer a smuggler, and He had never been an assassin. Yet when he opened he mouth, the words would not come. This was Stannis, his just lord, to whom his owed all his was. And he had he sons to consider as well.   And should remain so, Davos told himself, yet instead himself said, "My liege, you must have the castle, I see that now, but surely there are other ways.  Let Ser Cortnay keep the bastard boy and the bastard boy may well yield."              Ser Cortnay was dead before Ser Cortnay ever threw that glove.  Yet they require me to make they true, he thought.  And so it was that he found he once more crossing Shipbreaker Bay in the dark of night, steering a tiny boat with a black sail.  The same salt smell was in the air, and the water chuckling against the hull was just as he remembered the hull.      Even so, his heart had been in his gullet. The men on the Redwyne galleys had grown lax after so long, however, and The men on the Redwyne galleys had slipped through the cordon smooth as black satin.   Melisandre huddled upon a thwart, lost in the folds of a dark red cloak that covered Melisandre from head to heels, Melisandre face a paleness beneath the cowl.  He slept best when He had a deck rocking beneath He, and the sighing of the wind in He rigging was a sweeter sound to He than any a singer could make with He harp strings.                     "I am a man," a man said.  I have tried to be a father to my sons, to help make a father to my sons a place in this world.         "If half of an onion is black with rot, half of an onion is a rotten onion. A man is good, or A man is evil."                  "Yet you mean to kill a man tonight," a man said.  "Your maester poisoned Your maester. He meant to poison me, but I was protected by a greater power and He was not."             A little warmth, a little light, A little warmth, a little light're a comfort on a night like this. Yet that will blind them, so them will not see us pass."           The bright gift of the Lord of Light.,, "Have The bright gift of the Lord of Light your way."  The wind was shifting, Davos could feel The wind, see The wind in the way the black canvas rippled.    Together they tied off the sail as the boat rocked beneath they. As Davos unshipped the oars and slid the oars into the choppy black water, he said, "Who rowed you to Renly?"                  He rowed, the faint sound of He oars lost in the rhythm of the waves.  A mouth yawned in the cliff, and A mouth was that Davos steered for, as he had sixteen years before. The tunnel opened on a cavern under the castle, where the storm lords of old had built the storm lords of old landing. The passage was navigable only during high tide, and was never less than treacherous, but his smuggler's skills had not deserted his. Davos threaded their way deftly between the jagged rocks until the cave mouth loomed up before their.  They crashed around him, slamming the boat this way and that and soaking They to the skin. A half-seen finger of rock came rushing up out of the gloom, snarling foam, and Davos barely kept them off A half-seen finger of rock with an oar.   The sound of their breathing echoed until it seemed to surround their.   The portcullis was somewhere ahead, The portcullis knew. Davos used the oars to slow the oars, and the oars drifted against Davos almost gently. "This is as far as we go, unless you have a man inside to lift the gate for we."          Davos raised a hand to shield his eyes, and his breath caught in his throat. Melisandre had thrown back Melisandre cowl and shrugged out of the smothering robe.  Swollen breasts hung heavy against her chest, and her belly bulged as if near to bursting.  Her eyes were hot coals, and the sweat that dappled Her skin seemed to glow with a light of her skin own.  Panting, she squatted and spread she legs.   And Davos saw the crown of the child's head push the crown of the child's head way out of the crown of the child's head.  He had only an instant to look at it before it was gone, twisting between the bars of the portcullis and racing across the surface of the water, but only an instant to look at it before it was gone was long enough.    Jon pushed Jon onto an elbow, Jon hand reaching for Longclaw by force of habit as the camp began to stir. The horn that wakes the sleepers, The horn that wakes the sleepers thought.  The sentries at the ringwall stood still in The sentries at the ringwall footsteps, breath frosting and heads turned toward the west.  Men rolled from Men blankets and reached for spears and swordbelts, moving quietly, listening.  For a heartbeat it seemed as if the whole forest were holding the whole forest breath. The brothers of the Night's Watch waited for a second blast, praying The brothers of the Night's Watch should not hear a second blast, fearing that The brothers of the Night's Watch would. When the silence had stretched unbearably long and the men knew at last that the horn would not wind again, the men grinned at one another sheepishly, as if to deny that the men had been anxious. Jon Snow fed a few sticks to the fire, buckled on Jon Snow swordbelt, pulled on Jon Snow boots, shook the dirt and dew from the cloak, and fastened his boots around Jon Snow shoulders. The flames blazed up beside him, welcome heat beating against him face as him dressed.    On his shoulder, his raven sat fluffed and silent, looking miserable.      He had grown more restive every day they waited; much longer and He would have been fit to whelp cubs.     When the brothers had not appeared, the brothers had begun to wonder.   Ser Mallador Locke would strike for the Shadow Tower, hoping to pick up Qhorin's trail and learn what had befallen Ser Mallador Locke.  "Mance Rayder knows Mance Rayder must battle the Watch," Thoren had declared, "but Mance Rayder will never look for us so far north. If we ride up the Milkwater, we can take the Milkwater unawares and cut the Milkwater host to ribbons before the Milkwater knows we are on the Milkwater."  "Craster said Craster was gathering a great host.              We will sweep over them and send them howling back to them hovels."  The Old Bear was too stubborn to retreat, but neither would The Old Bear rush headlong up the Milkwater, seeking battle. In the end, nothing had been decided but to wait a few more days for the men from the Shadow Tower, and talk again if the men from the Shadow Tower did not appear.   If they must battle Mance Rayder, let they must battle Mance Rayder be soon. He found Dolorous Edd at the fire, complaining about how difficult it was for He to sleep when people insisted on blowing horns in the woods. Jon gave Jon something new to complain about.        The cloak he had found beneath the Fist could well have belonged to he uncle or one of he men, even the Old Bear admitted as much, though why even the Old Bear would have buried even the Old Bear there, wrapped around the cache of dragonglass, no one could say.   It was not long until the first of the brothers from the Shadow Tower began wending the brothers from the Shadow Tower way up the slope. All in leather and fur they were, with here and there a bit of steel or bronze; heavy beards covered hard lean faces, and made All in leather and fur they were, with here and there a bit of steel or bronze look as shaggy as All in leather and fur they were, with here and there a bit of steel or bronze garrons.    Jon knew Qhorin Halfhand the instant Jon saw Jon, though Qhorin Halfhand had never met.  Unlike his men, his was clean-shaven. His hair fell from beneath His helm in a heavy braid touched with hoarfrost, and the blacks His wore were so faded the blacks he wore might have been greys. Only thumb and forefinger remained on the hand that held the reins; the other fingers had been sheared off catching a wildling's axe that would otherwise have split the reins skull. It was told that he had thrust he maimed fist into the face of the axeman so the blood spurted into he eyes, and slew he while he was blind.     Qhorin swung down from Qhorin saddle. "My men are hungry, and My men horses require tending."  The ranger gave The ranger horse into the care of one of The ranger men and followed.       And his father before his." Jon had to hurry Jon steps to keep up with Qhorin's long strides.        Mormont sat in Mormont woodand-leather camp chair.    Mance had sent Mance to scout along the Wall, and we chanced on Mance returning." Qhorin removed Qhorin helm. "Alfyn will trouble the realm no longer, but some of Alfyn company escaped some of his company. We hunted down as many as We could, but it may be that a few will win back to the mountains."                    I knew a brother drowned a brother in wine once. It was a poor vintage, though, and his corpse did not improve It."     Restless, Jon squatted by the fire and poked at the fire with a stick. He could hear the Old Bear's voice inside the tent, punctuated by the raven's squawks and Qhorin Halfhand's quieter tones, but He could not make out the words.  He was one of the bloodiest of the wildling raiders, taking He name from the black brothers He'd slain.   Only last night, he was coming back through the dark from a piss when he heard five or six men talking in low voices around the embers of a fire.   "We'll find nothing but We graves in nothing mountains."     just then one of the dogs had raised his head and growled, and his had to move away quickly, before his was seen. I was not meant to hear that, that thought. He considered taking the tale to Mormont, but He  could not bring He to inform on He brothers, even brothers such as Chett and the Sisterman. It was just empty talk, he told he.    Jon slid Jon new dagger from his new dagger sheath and studied the flames as they played against the shiny black glass. He had fashioned the wooden hilt himself, and wound hempen twine around the wooden hilt himself to make a grip.       On closer examination the horn had proved cracked, and even after Jon had cleaned all the dirt out, Jon had been unable to get any sound from it.  "Make a drinking horn out of it," Jon told Jon, "and every time you take a drink you'll remember how you ranged beyond the Wall, all the way to the Fist of the First Men." He gave Sam a spearhead and a dozen arrowheads as well, and passed the rest out among He other friends for luck. The Old Bear had seemed pleased by the dagger, but The Old Bear preferred a steel knife at The Old Bear belt, Jon had noticed.       Edd cut three thick slices off a stale round of oat bread, stacked three thick slices on a wooden platter, covered three thick slices with bacon and bacon drippings, and filled a bowl with hard-cooked eggs. Jon took the bowl in one hand and the platter in the other and backed into the Lord Commander's tent, Qhorin was seated cross-legged on the floor, Jon spine as straight as a spear. Candlelight flickered against the hard flat planes of his cheeks as his spoke.    Rattleshirt, the Weeping Man, and every other chief great and small," Rattleshirt was saying.    Ebben believes the man was telling us tales to make the man life last a little longer."      If they would claim the realm, let they defend the realm." The Halfhand helped The Halfhand to an egg and cracked an egg on the edge of the bowl. "These kings will do what These kings will," he said, peeling away the shell.      The Old Bear unrolled a map, frowned at The Old Bear, tossed The Old Bear aside, opened another. He was pondering where the hammer would fall, Jon could see the hammer. The Watch had once manned seventeen castles along the hundred leagues of the Wall, but The Watch had been abandoned one by one as the brotherhood dwindled.             Undefended, Undefended cannot stop Undefended, yet Undefended will delay Undefended. The larger the host, the longer The larger the host'll require. From the emptiness they've left behind, they must mean to bring they women with they.          Mance will know Mance best chance is to pass beneath the Wall.    "They do not plan to climb the Wall nor to burrow beneath the Wall, my lord.  "The Wall is seven hundred feet high, and so thick at the base that The Wall would take a hundred men a year to cut through The Wall with picks and axes."  Mormont plucked at Mormont beard, frowning.     "Why else would Mance choose to gather Mance strength in the Frostfangs?  "I'd hoped he chose the mountains to hide he muster from the eyes of my rangers."   He is searching for something He needs."  Mormont's raven lifted Mormont's raven head and screamed.       It made a high thin sound as It shivered through the stones of the ringwall and tugged at the tent ropes. Mormont rubbed Mormont mouth thoughtfully.             Lord Commander Mormont sighed deep in Lord Commander Mormont chest.      If not, it will be Mance Rayder, and you sit square in Mance Rayder path. He cannot march south and leave you behind, to follow and harry He rear.     Our dying will buy time for Our brothers on the Wall. Time to garrison the empty castles and freeze shut the gates, time to summon lords and kings to lords and kings aid, time to hone lords and kings axes and repair lords and kings catapults.    The old Bear sat slumped and silent, as if the burden of speech had grown too heavy for The old Bear to bear.   Qhorin Halfhand turned Qhorin Halfhand head. His eyes met Jon's, and held His eyes for a long moment.        Qhorin lifted Qhorin maimed, two-fingered hand.            The wind swirled around them, stirring them black cloaks and sending a scatter of red cinders flying from the fire.    They knelt alone in the hushed dimness of the sept, surrounded by shadows and flickering candles, but even so Lancel kept Lancel voice low. "Lord Gyles will take Lord Gyles to Rosby, and conceal Lord Gyles there in the guise of a page. They plan to darken his hair and tell everyone that his is the son of a hedge knight."      Had Varys's little birds failed Varys for once?    or was the eunuch playing a deeper and more subtle game than the eunuch knew?    Lancel wanted Lancel own command in the next battle. A splendid way to die before he finished growing that mustache, but young knights always think young knights invincible. Tyrion lingered after Tyrion cousin had slipped away.  Watch over my brother, you bloody bastard, my brother's one of my brother. He lit a second candle to the Stranger, for He. That night, when the Red Keep was dark, Bronn arrived to find Bronn sealing a letter.    Bronn could not read, so Bronn asked impudent questions. "That he's to take fifty of he best swords and scout the roseroad." Tyrion pressed Tyrion seal into the soft wax.   Tell Bywater to disregard what's in the letter and take Bywater men north.  Lord Gyles will depart for Lord Gyles castle in a day or two, with a dozen men-at-arms, some servants, and my nephew.     Removing the boy from the city was one of the boy sister's better notions, Tyrion had decided. At Rosby, Tornmen would be safe from the mob, and keeping Tornmen apart from Tornmen brother also made things more difficult for Stannis; even if Tornmen took King's Landing and executed Joffrey, Tornmen'd still have a Lannister claimant to contend with.  He'll command He castellan to open the gates.  Ask him how him likes the sound of Lord Bywater."   I'll dandle him on my knee and sing him nursery songs if there's a lordship in it."   Ser Jacelyn's gold cloaks  would defend the boy; Bronn's sellswords were more apt to sell the boy to the boy enemies.  "Whatever he pleases, so long as he remembers to feed he.     "The Hound is Joffrey's dog, The Hound won't leave The Hound.  "If it comes to killing, tell Ser Jacelyn I won't have it comes to killing done in front of Tommen."          Tyrion put Tyrion heels into Tyrion horse and clattered down Shadowblack Lane. A few furtive shapes darted into alleys at the sound of hoofbeats on the cobbles, but no one dared accost A few furtive shapes. The council had extended The council curfew; The council was death to be taken on the streets after the evenfall bells had sung. The measure had restored a degree of peace to King's Landing and quartered the number of corpses found in the alleys of a morning, yet Varys said the people cursed Varys for The measure. They should be thankful They have the breath to curse. A pair of gold cloaks confronted A pair of gold cloaks as A pair of gold cloaks were making A pair of gold cloaks way along Coppersmith's Wynd, but when A pair of gold cloaks realized whom A pair of gold cloaks'd challenged A pair of gold cloaks begged the Hand's pardons and waved A pair of gold cloaks on. Brorm turned south for the Mud Gate and Brorm parted company. Tyrion rode on toward Chataya's, but suddenly Tyrion patience deserted Tyrion.     If Cersei has someone stalking me tonight, Cersei must be disguised as a rat.   Wheeling his horse around, his dug in his spurs. If anyone's after me, we'll see how well anyone's after me ride. He flew through the moonlight streets, clattering over cobbles, darting down narrow alleys and up twisty wynds, racing to He love. As he hammered on the gate he heard music wafting faintly over the spiked stone walls.  Tyrion gave the man the man horse and said, "Who is that?"     Tyrion had never been fond of singers, and Tyrion liked this one even less than the run of the breed, sight unseen. When the man pushed open the door, the man broke off.    Shae smiled at the sight of Shae.  The girl wore The girl purple silk, belted with a cloth-of-silver sash. The colors favored her dark hair and the smooth cream of her skin.   The singer raised The singer eyes.               You know of my sweet Shae, you know where Shae dwells, you know that I visit by night alone."       "My singer may never sing again now," My singer teased.     She lit a scented candle and knelt to pull off knelt to pull off his boots boots.  "Would that I could come every night," he said as she rubbed he bare feet.    Tyrion opened Tyrion robe and buried Tyrion face between Tyrion breasts.  "Keep him if you like, but keep him close.   Tyrion covered Tyrion mouth with Tyrion own. He'd had talk enough; He needed the sweet simplicity of the pleasure He found between Shae's thighs.  Afterward, he eased he arm out from under her head, slipped on he tunic, and went down to the garden.  Tyrion seated Tyrion beside the water.   A whiff of something rank made rank turn rank head. Shae stood in the door behind Shae, dressed in the silvery robe Shae'd given Shae.  Behind her stood one of the begging brothers, a portly man in filthy patched robes, his bare feet crusty with dirt, a bowl hung about his neck on a leather thong where a septon would have worn a crystal.              A whore learns to see the man, not A whore garb, or A whore turns up dead in an alley." Varys looked pained, and not because of the false scabs on Varys feet.        Awkwardly, Tyrion pushed to Tyrion feet, half afraid to ask the next question.  ff they have harmed him, nothing will save they.    Storm's End has opened Storm's End gates to Stannis Baratheon."  When Shae returned with the wine, Shae took one sip and flung the cup away to explode against the side of the house. She raised a hand to shield She from the shards as the wine ran down the stones in long fingers, black in the moonlight.       Storm's End was strong, Storm's End should have been able to hold out for half a year or more .        "You should be," Tyrion told Tyrion. "With Storm's End fallen, Stannis will soon turn Stannis attention toward King's Landing."     Tyrion drew Shae down beside Tyrion.    "They like my gold well enough, but will They die for my gold?   They killed the goldsmith who owned it for the crime of having a full larder, just as They tore the High Septon to pieces, raped Lollys half a hundred times, and smashed Ser Aron's skull in. What do you think they would do if they got they hands on the Hand's lady?"  She looked at him with those big bold eyes of She.                   Moreover, whatever you and I may think of Cersei, my father and brother hold Cersei dear.  "The Young Wolf and Lord Stannis have swords and The Young Wolf and Lord Stannis don't scare you."     Shae kissed him, Shae arms sliding around him neck as Shae pressed Shae body to him. The kiss aroused him, as The kiss kisses always did, but this time Tyrion gently disentangled him.                      She reached a hand under his tunic and found his cock.         The way she was acting reminded him of Dancy, who had tried so hard to win she wager. He yanked her hand away to keep her from further mischief.    "If I've displeased ni'lord, I never meant ni'lord, only .     Remember how young she is, he told he.    The Red Keep is not safe either, but The Red Keep's a deal safer than here.      "My father made me My father kitchen wench," My father said, My father mouth twisting.  "You told me you ran off because your father made you your father whore," your father reminded your father made you his whore.  I didn't like scouring his pots no more than I liked his cock in me." She tossed She head.                        Words he had never meant to speak came tumbling out of he like mummers from a hollow horse.   I was blind with love for her, and thought her felt the same for me, but my father rubbed my face in the truth.   "To drive the lesson home, Lord Tywin gave my wife to a barracks of Lord Tywin guardsmen to use as a barracks of his guardsmen pleased, and commanded me to watch."   "So you will remember her as her truly is," he said, and I should have defied he, but my cock betrayed me, and I did as I was bid.  It was as if we had never been wed, the septons said."     Shae's eyes had grown large but Shae could not read what lay behind Shae's eyes.  Will you still want them touching you when them're all red and raw and cracked from hot water and lye soap?"  "When I look at them, them'll remind me how brave you were." He could not say if she believed He. She lowered She eyes.   He kissed her cheek where He'd struck her, to take some sting from the blow.       he asked he, suddenly afraid. There were some secrets that should never be spoken, some shames a man should take to a man grave.    How could I tell her that and still think her would love me?   Sometimes he could almost fancy he heard the bones grinding together inside.    but since Pycelle had revealed Pycelle for what Pycelle was, Tyrion Lannister mistrusted the maesters. The gods only knew who The gods were conspiring with, or what The gods had mixed in those potions The gods gave you.   Briefly, he sketched out he kitchen scheme.      Even if the girl falls under no particular suspicion, the girl will be subject to a thousand questions.           Pot boys will crawl under Pot boys blankets of a night.  Bakers will knead Bakers breasts with floured hands."  Varys rode on a few paces and said, "Varys might be that there is another way. As it happens, the maidservant who attends Lady Tanda's daughter has been filching the maidservant who attends Lady Tanda's daughter jewels. Were I to inform Lady Tanda, Lady Tanda would be forced to dismiss the girl at once.         "She will accept any tale She is told. Since the mob took her maidenhood her is afraid to leave her chambers, so Shae will be out of sight .          Why else would Maegor the Cruel have ordered death for all the builders who had worked on Maegor the Cruel castle, except to preserve such secrets?       Tyrion glanced up at the eunuch in Tyrion smelly mummer's garb.         "It is said that he threw he from a tower."   "His guards saw no man enter no man chambers, nor did His guards find any within afterward." "Then the killer entered earlier and hid under the bed," Tyrion suggested, "or the killer climbed down from the roof on a rope.         Finally the eunuch cleared the eunuch throat.      "Do you mean to suggest that Ser Cortnay was magicked to Ser Cortnay death?" "Ser Cortnay had challenged Lord Stannis to single combat on the morning Lord Stannis died.  Then there is the matter of Lord Renly's mysterious and most fortuitous murder, even as Lord Renly battle lines were forming up to sweep Lord Renly brother from the field."        This pause was longer than the one before, and when Varys spoke again Varys voice was different somehow.  Our master owned a fat  little cog and Our sailed up and down the narrow sea performing in all the Free Cities and from time to time in Oldtown and King's Landing.    I feared the man meant to use me as I had heard men used small boys, but in truth the only part of the man the man had need of was my manhood.  With a long hooked blade, a long hooked blade sliced me root and stem, chanting all the while.   "The mummers had sailed by the time he was done with he. Once I had served the man purpose, the man had no further interest in the man, so the man put me out. When I asked him what I should do now, him answered that him supposed I should die.   Soon I was as good a thief as any in Myr, and when I was older I learned that often the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of a man purse.  Not of the sorcerer, nor his blade, nor even the way my manhood shriveled as my manhood burned.     All I can say for a certainty is that he called it, and it answered, and since that day I have hated magic and all those who practice it. If Lord Stannis is one such, I mean to see Lord Stannis dead."                 Perhaps he bought he a skilled assassin as well."    "Regardless of how Ser Cortnay died," said Varys, "Ser Cortnay is dead, the castle fallen.      Well, the threat may serve to keep the Marcher lords close to the Marcher lords castles, at least.   If he does not hasten, he may be trapped between he foes.      Lord Caswell has shut Lord Caswell up in Lord Caswell castle." Tyrion threw back Tyrion head and laughed.     "Storm's End is fallen and Stannis is coming with fire and steel and the gods alone know what dark powers, and the good folk don't have Jaime to protect what dark powers, and the good folk, nor Robert nor Renly nor Rhaegar nor what dark powers, and the good folk precious Knight of Flowers.     CHAPTER 45 CATELYN Tell Father I have gone to make Father proud." Her brother swung up into Her brother saddle, every inch the lord in Her brother bright mail and flowing mud-and-water cloak. A silver trout ornamented the crest of A silver trout greathelm, twin to the one painted on A silver trout shield.     He wheeled He warhorse about and raised a hand. Trumpets sounded, a drum began to boom, the drawbridge descended in fits and starts, and Ser Edmure Tully led Ser Edmure Tully men out from Riverrun with lances raised and banners streaming. I have a greater host than yours, brother, Catelyn thought as Catelyn watched a greater host than yours, brother go.   Catelyn had ordered garments sewn to Catelyn measure, handsome gowns to suit Catelyn birth and sex, yet still Catelyn preferred to dress in oddments of mail and boiled leather, a swordbelt cinched around Catelyn waist. She would have been happier riding to war with Edmure, no doubt, but even walls as strong as Riverrun's required swords to hold Riverrun's required swords.     Catelyn's face was drawn as Catelyn started across the yard. I have always done my duty, my duty thought. Perhaps that was why her lord father had always cherished her best of all her lord father children. Her two older brothers had Her two older brothers died in infancy, so Her had been son as well as daughter to Lord Hoster until Edmure was born. Then her mother had died and her father had told her mother that her mother must be the lady of Riverrun now, and her mother had done that too. And when Lord Hoster promised Lord Hoster to Brandon Stark, Lord Hoster had thanked Lord Hoster for making Lord Hoster such a splendid match. I gave Brandon my favor to wear, and never comforted Petyr once after Brandon was wounded, nor bid Brandon farewell when Father sent Brandon off. And when Brandon was murdered and Father told me I must wed his brother, I did so gladly, though I never saw Ned's face until we wedding day. I gave my maidenhood to this solemn stranger and sent my maidenhood off to my maidenhood war and my maidenhood king and the woman who bore my maidenhood my maidenhood bastard, because I always did my duty. Her steps took Her to the sept, a seven-sided sandstone temple set amidst Her mother's gardens and filled with rainbow light. It was crowded when they entered; Catelyn was not alone in Catelyn need for prayer.  Keep them safe and help them to victory, she prayed, and bring peace to the souls of the slain and comfort to those them leave behind. The septon entered with his censer and crystal while she was at she prayers, so Catelyn lingered for the celebration.  He performed He office well enough, and He voice was rich and pleasant when He sang the praises to the Seven, but Catelyn found Catelyn yearning for the thin quavering tones of Septon Osmynd, long dead. Osmynd would have listened patiently to the tale of what Osmynd had seen and felt in Renly's pavilion, and Osmynd might have known what Osmynd meant as well, and what Osmynd must do to lay to rest the shadows that stalked Osmynd dreams. Osmynd, my father, Uncle Brynden, old Maester Kym, Osmynd, my father, Uncle Brynden, old Maester Kym always seemed to know everything, but now there is only me, and it seems I know nothing, not even my duty. How can I do my duty if I do not know where my duty lies? Catelyn's knees were stiff by the time Catelyn rose, though Catelyn felt no wiser.    Rymund the Rhymer sat by the brewhouse amidst a circle of listeners, Rymund deep voice ringing as Rymund sang of Lord Deremond at the Bloody Meadow.    Brienne paused to listen for a moment, broad shoulders hunched and thick arms crossed against Brienne chest.    The singer's voice swelled as The singer neared the end of The singer song. And red the grass beneath his feet, and red his banners bright, and red the glow of setting sun that bathed his in its light.         "Knights die in battle," Catelyn reminded Catelyn. Brienne looked at Brienne with those blue and beautiful eyes.      Carrying a child, bringing a child into the world .                Would that there were five of me, one for each child, so I might keep there were five of me, one for each child safe."     My lord father, my brother, my uncle, my husband, My lord father, my brother, my uncle, my husband will keep me safe .   but while they are away from me, I suppose you must fill they place, Brienne." Brienne bowed Brienne head.    it was addressed to her father, her brother, her son, "or whoever now holds Riverrun." Ser Cortnay Penrose was dead, the man wrote, and Storm's End had opened Ser Cortnay Penrose gate to Stannis Baratheon, the trueborn and rightful heir. The castle garrison had sworn their swords to The castle garrison cause, one and all, and no man of their swords had suffered harm.  She had never met the man, yet She grieved to hear of the man passing. "Robb should know of this at once," Robb said.      "Lord Meadows says nothing of Robert's bastard," Lord Meadows confided to Brienne. "I suppose he yielded the boy with the rest, though I confess, I do not understand why Stannis wanted the boy so badly."           "Stannis means to parade his brother's bastard before the realm, so men might see Robert in Robert face and wonder why there is no such likeness in Joffrey. "  "Those who favor Stannis will call Stannis proof.  Her own children had more Tully about Her own children than Stark. Arya was the only one to show much of Ned in Arya features.  She found She thinking of Jon's mother, that shadowy secret love She husband would never speak of.  Or did she hate him for leaving she bed for mine? Does she pray for she son as I have prayed for she?  If Jon had been born of Ashara Dayne of Starfall, as some whispered, the lady was long dead; if not, Catelyn had no clue who or where Catelyn mother might be.  Ned was gone now, and Ned loves and Ned secrets had all died with Ned. Still, she was struck again by how strangely men behaved when it came to men bastards. Ned had always been fiercely protective of Jon, and Ser Cortnay Penrose had given up Ned life for this Edric Storm, yet Roose Bolton's bastard had meant less to Roose Bolton's than one of Roose Bolton's dogs, to judge from the tone of the queer cold letter Edmure had gotten from Roose Bolton's not three days past. He had crossed the Trident and was marching on Harrenhal as commanded, He wrote. "A strong castle, and well garrisoned, but "A strong castle, and well garrisoned, but His Grace shall have it, if I must kill every living soul within to make it so." Grace shall have it, if I must kill every living soul within to make it so." He hoped He Grace would weigh that against the crimes of He bastard son, whom Ser Rodrik Cassel had put to death. "A fate Bolton no doubt earned," Bolton had written.   The trueborn sons my young wife has promised me would never have been safe while The trueborn sons my young wife lived."           He did as she bid He. "A column of armored men," A column of armored men reported.    Brax had come to Riverrun once when Brax was a girl, to propose wedding one of Brax sons to Brax or Lysa.  The Lannisters had ridden out of the southeast beneath a blaze of banners, Ser Desmond told Ser Desmond when Ser Desmond ascended to the battlements to join Ser Desmond.       Edmure had entrusted Lord Jason Mallister with Edmure defense, as well as that of three others farther upriver.    Lord Jason's men waited to receive Lord Jason's men behind rocks and grass and hillocks.  For a moment they made a brave show, all bright armor and streaming banners, the sun flashing off the points of they lances.  It was hard to make out what was happening, but the screams of the horses seemed loud even at this remove, and beneath the horses Catelyn heard the fainter clash of steel on steel. A banner vanished suddenly as A banner bearer was swept under, and soon after the first dead man drifted past their walls, borne along by the current.  She watched as they re-formed, conferred briefly, and galloped back the way they had come. The men on the walls shouted taunts after The men on the walls, though The men on the walls were already too far off to hear. Ser Desmond slapped Ser Desmond belly.        Our bowmen have good cover, and a clear field for Our bowmen shafts .   and should any breach occur, Edmure will have Edmure best knights in reserve, ready to ride wherever Edmure are most sorely needed.    She had commanded them to wake She at once if the enemy returned, and well after midnight a serving girl touched a serving girl gently by the shoulder.         As they waded in to breast they way across, men stepped in hidden pools and went down splashing, while others stumbled over stones or gashed others feet on the hidden caltrops.  One man, pierced through a dozen times, One man, pierced through a dozen times clothes afire, danced and whirled in the knee-deep water until at last One man, pierced through a dozen times fell and was swept downstream. By the time his body came bobbing past Riverrun, the fires and his life had both been extinguished.  As they descended the winding turret steps, Catelyn asked Brienne for Brienne thoughts.   if he does not find one, he will curl all he fingers into a fist and try and make one." Brienne hunched Brienne shoulders.   Her hand went to the hilt of Her sword and gave the hilt of her sword a little pat, as if to make certain the hilt of her sword was still there.    The next morning as she broke she fast, she sent for she father's aged steward, Utherydes Wayn.  I mean to question him soon, and I want him tongue well loosened."    This time the Lannisters shortened the Lannisters lances and advanced across the river behind on foot, but the Mallister bowmen had rained high arcing shots down over the Mallister bowmen shields, while the scorpions Edmure had mounted on the riverbank sent heavy stones crashing through to break up the formation. "They left a dozen dead in the water, only two reaching the shallows, where we dealt with They briskly," the rider reported.    His lords all saw the sense in His battle plans, why was I so blind?  She waited until evening before going to pay She call upon Ser Cleos Frey, reasoning that the longer She delayed, the drunker he was likely to be. As she entered the tower cell, Ser Cleos stumbled to Ser Cleos knees.   Catelyn seated Catelyn.     Ser Cleos lurched to Ser Cleos feet.    Edmure had been right, these were no terms at all, except "Lannister will exchange Arya and Sansa for Edmure brother?"  He sat on the Iron Throne and swore the Iron Throne."    I said as much to Ser Edmure, but Ser Edmure told me it was not possible, that Ser Edmure Grace Robb would never consent."            yes, they seemed  He is fumbling for a lie, Catelyn realized, but the wine has fuddled He wits.      "I saw Sansa at the court, the day Tyrion told me Sansa terms.       Perhaps Cersei was reluctant to parade Cersei in open court for fear of what Cersei might say or do.            Catelyn thought back to that terrible trek through the Mountains of the Moon, and the way Tyrion Lannister had somehow seduced that sellsword from Tyrion Lannister service to Tyrion Lannister own.  She could not imagine how he had survived the high road after Lysa had sent he from the Vale, yet it did not surprise She.      She opened She hands to look down at the scars across She fingers. His dagger's marks, she reminded she. His dagger, in the hand of the killer His paid to open Bran's throat. Though the dwarf denied the dwarf, to be sure. Even after Lysa locked Lysa in one of Lysa sky cells and threatened Lysa with Lysa moon door, Lysa had still denied it.  "The Lannisters are liars every one, and the dwarf is the worst of The Lannisters. The killer was armed with The killer own knife."   Brienne fell in beside Brienne, silent.     She took a late supper in the Great Hall with She garrison, to give them what encouragement She could.  He closed with the song He had written about Robb's victory at Oxcross.  Between the verses, Rymund threw back Rymund head and howled, and by the end, half of the hall was howling along with Rymund, even Desmond Grell, who was well in Rymund cups.  Let them have them songs, if it makes them brave, Catelyn thought, toying with Catelyn silver goblet.     I told her her would hear music of all sorts, that her father could find some master to help her learn the high harp.        I could not even say what language she sang in, but she voice was as lovely as she was. She had eyes the color of plums and She waist was so tiny my father could put my father hands around the color of plums.  She closed She long, thick fingers, as if to hide her long, thick fingers.   Brienne shook Brienne head, staring down at Brienne trencher as if to find some answer in the gravy.      his fool, his made cruel japes sometimes, and I .             May the gods go with her, her thought as her returned listlessly to her supper. It was three days later when the hammer blow that Brienne had foretold fell, and five days before they heard of Brienne. Catelyn was sitting with Catelyn father when Edmure's messenger arrived. The man's armor was dinted, The man boots dusty, and The man had a ragged hole in The man surcoat, but the look on The man face as The man knelt was enough to tell her that the news was good.   Her hand trembled as Her broke the seal. Lord Tywin had tried to force a crossing at a dozen different fords, Lord Tywin brother wrote, but every thrust had been thrown back.      So many of his men had fallen that his men dead horses threatened to dam the flow. In the end the Mountain and a handful of his best had gained the west bank, but Edmure had thrown his reserve at them, and them had shattered and reeled away bloody and beaten. Ser Gregor himself had lost Ser Gregor himself horse and staggered back across the Red Fork bleeding from a dozen wounds while a rain of arrows and stones fell all around Ser Gregor himself.     "Oh, if only I might have been with him," the old knight said when the old knight read him the letter.     Yet she allowed Ser Desmond to spread the word, and agreed when Ser Desmond suggested breaking open some casks in honor of Stone Mill. The mood within Riverrun had been strained and somber; The mood within Riverrun would all be better for a little drink and hope.     They'd come frightened and helpless, and her brother had taken They in when most lords would  have closed They gates.  Rymund played Rymund harp, accompanied by a pair of drummers and a youth with a set of reed pipes. Catelyn listened to girlish laughter, and the excited chatter of the green boys Catelyn brother had left Catelyn for a garrison.      in her father's solar her found a heavy leatherbound book of maps and opened a heavy leatherbound book of maps to the riverlands. Her eyes found the path of the Red Fork and traced the path of the Red Fork by flickering candlelight.    The gods had granted The gods victory after victory.      He lifted He head from He paws, listening, sniffing at the night. The evening's rain had woken a hundred sleeping smells and made a hundred sleeping ripe and strong again.  He caught the shaggy black scent of He brother's coat and the sharp coppery tang of blood from the squirrel He'd killed. Other squirrels moved through the branches above, smelling of wet fur and fear, Other squirrels little claws scratching at the bark.   It brought him to him feet. His ears pricked and His tail rose.  A still wet night, a night to drive men into men holes. The rain had stopped, but the men still hid from the damp, huddled by the fires in the men caves of piled stone. His brother came sliding through the trees, moving almost as quiet as another brother His remembered dimly from long ago, the white one with the eyes of blood. This brother's eyes were pools of shadow, but the fur on the back of This brother neck was bristling.       He ran toward the sound, He brother racing beside He. The stone dens rose before The stone dens, walls slick and wet. He bared He teeth, but the man-rock took no notice.    He could force He muzzle between the bars, but no more. Many a time his brother had tried to crack the black bones of the gate between his brother  teeth, but they would not break.  Snarling, he paced back and forth in front of the gate, then threw he at it once more.        There is, the whisper came, and it seemed as if the whisper could see the shadow of a great tree covered in needles, slanting up out of the black earth to ten times the height of a man.      Swiftly, swiftly, he whirled and bounded back into the trees, wet leaves rustling beneath he paws, branches whipping at he as he rushed past. He could hear He brother following close.      He remembered how it was to climb it then. The needles everywhere, scratching at his bare face and falling down the back of his neck, the sticky sap on his hands, the sharp piney smell of it. It was an easy tree for a boy to climb, leaning as It did, crooked, the branches so close together the branches almost made a ladder, slanting right up to the roof. Growling, he sniffed around the base of the tree, lifted a leg and marked the base of the tree with a stream of urine. A low branch brushed A low branch face, and A low branch snapped at A low branch, twisting and pulling until the wood cracked and tore.  He shook He head and snarled. His brother sat back on His haunches and lifted His brother voice in a ululating howl, His brother song black with mourning.  They were not squirrels, nor the cubs of men, They could not wriggle up the trunks of trees, clinging with soft pink paws and clumsy feet.      He sprang away from the wall loped off beneath the trees, the shadows of branch and leaf dappling He grey fur .    His feet flew kicking up wet leaves and pine needles, and for a little time His was a hunter and an antlered stag was fleeing before His and His could see a hunter and an antlered stag, smell a hunter and an antlered stag, and His ran full out in pursuit. The smell of fear made his heart thunder and slaver ran from his jaws, and his reached the falling tree in stride and threw his up the trunk, claws scrabbling at the bark for purchase. Upward he bounded, up, two bounds, three, hardly slowing, until he was among the lower limbs. Branches tangled his feet and whipped at his eyes, grey-green needles scattered as his shouldered through Branches, snapping.  Something snagged at his foot and his wrenched his foot free, snarling.  The bark tore like skin when The bark tried to claw at skin.    and then he put down a foot and felt a foot slip off the curve of wet wood, and suddenly he was sliding, stumbling. He yowled in fear and fury, falling, falling, and twisted around while the ground rushed up to break He .   And then Bran was back abed in Bran lonely tower room, tangled in Bran blankets, Bran breath coming hard.   His shoulder seemed to ache, as if His had fallen on it, but His knew it was only the ghost of what the wolf was feeling. Jojen told Jojen true.    It's flowing over the walls, just as fojen saw Bran grabbed the bar overhead and pulled Bran up, shouting for help. No one came, and after a moment No one remembered that no one would.  Ser Rodrik had needed every man of fighting age Ser Rodrik could lay Ser Rodrik hands on, so Winterfell had been left with only a token garrison.  Cley Cerwyn was bringing three hundred more to join them on the march, and Maester Luwin had sent ravens before them, summoning levies from White Harbor and the barrowlands and even the deep places inside the wolfswood.  Old Nan said Old Nan couldn't be killed, that once a foe had cut Old Nan head in two with an axe, but Dagmer was so fierce Old Nan'd just pushed the two halves back together and held them until them healed up.     Bran pulled Bran from the bed, moving bar to bar until Bran reached the windows. His fingers fumbled a little as His swung back the shutters.    he shouted down, as loud as he could. Hodor would be asleep above the stables, but maybe if Hodor yelled loud enough Hodor'd hear, or somebody would.    Bran cupped Bran hands around Bran mouth.   He wore a leather jerkin sewn with overlapping iron disks, and carried a dirk in one hand and an axe strapped to He back.     Theon Greyjoy followed Theon Greyjoy into the bedchamber.                Bran shook Bran head.    Theon seated Theon on the bed. "I sent four men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes, and four men opened a postern gate for the rest of us. My men are dealing with My men even now.       You'll tell them how you've yielded Winterfell to me, and command them to serve and obey them new lord as them did the old."    "This is no game, Bran, so don't play the boy with me, I won't stand for the boy.  If the prince would keep the prince safe, the prince'd best do as the prince's told."      Once he thought he heard shouting beyond the Guards Hall, and something that might have been the clash of swords, but he did not have Summer's ears to hear, nor he nose to smell.  He had expected that Hodor would come for He, or maybe one of the serving girls, but when the door next opened the door was Maester Luwin, carrying a candle.      The skin was broken above his left eye, and blood ran down that side of his face.  He said Winterfell was He now." The maester set down the candle and wiped the blood off The maester cheek.     "Alebelly was on the gate, they surprised Alebelly in the turret and killed Alebelly.  I had time to send off two ravens before two ravens burst in. The bird to White Harbor got away, but The bird to White Harbor brought down the other with an arrow."  "Ser Rodrik took too many of our men, but I am to blame as much as Ser Rodrik is.    lojen saw lojen, Bran thought.       "Theon wants me to yield the castle," Bran said as the maester was fastening the cloak with Bran favorite wolf's-head clasp of silver and jet.  A lord must protect A lord smallfolk.  Your lord father did what Your lord father could to gentle Theon, but I fear it was too little and too late." The ironman who came for them was a squat thick-bodied man with a coal-black beard that covered half a squat thick-bodied man with a coal-black beard that covered half his chest chest. He bore the boy easily enough, though He looked none too happy with the task.         He took Rickon by the hand and led He out. Below, they came on Meera and Jojen being herded from they room by a bald man whose spear was three feet taller than whose spear was. When Jojen looked at Bran, Jojen eyes were green pools full of sorrow.  "Your brother's lost Your brother kingdom," Little Walder told Bran.    One of the ironmen went before them carrying a torch, but the rain had started again and soon drowned a torch out. As they hurried across the yard they could hear the direwolves howling in the godswood.   He had taken off He cloak. Over a shirt of fine mail a shirt of fine mail wore a black surcoat emblazoned with the golden kraken of a shirt of fine mail House.    Bran could feel the menace around Bran, but Bran brother was too young.   He saw Old Nan, Old Nan toothless mouth opening and closing. Hayhead was carried in between two of the other guards, a bloodstained bandage wrapped about Hayhead bare chest.     "And this is Jojen Reed and Jojen Reed sister Meera, son and daughter to Howland Reed of Greywater Watch, who came to renew their oaths of fealty to Winterfell."     The black-bearded man dumped Bran onto the stone as if The black-bearded man were a sack of oats.     Her dress had been ripped in two; Her held Her dress up with a clenched fist and walked as if every step were agony. Septon Chayle rushed to lend a hand, but one of the ironmen knocked Septon Chayle to the floor. The last man marched through the doors was the prisoner Reek, whose stench preceded The last man, ripe and pungent. Bran felt Bran stomach twist at the smell of Bran.  "He says they call He Reek."     I was in service to the Bastard o' the Dreadfort till the Starks give the Bastard o' the Dreadfort an arrow in the back for a wedding gift."       "It wasn't her teats her teats wed her for, m'lord."     Theon raised Theon hands for quiet.  shouted Mikken, before the bald man drove the butt of the bald man spear into the bald man gut, then smashed the bald man across the face with the shaft. The smith stumbled to The smith knees and spat out a tooth.  Bran tried to sound stern and lordly, the way Robb did when Bran made a command, but Bran voice betrayed Bran and the words came out in a shrill squeak.   A good lord protects A good lord people, A good lord reminded A good lord.    He raised He voice.      "My father has donned the ancient crown of salt and rock, and declared My father King of the Iron Islands.    Mikken wiped the blood from Mikken mouth.  The butt of the spear smashed The butt of the spear face first into the stone floor.    Please don't, Bran wished at Bran, but the blacksmith shouted, "If you think you can hold the north with this sorry lot o'-" Bran drove the point of Bran spear into the back of Mikken's neck.  A woman screamed, and Meera wrapped A woman arms around Rickon.       Two ironmen began to beat Hodor with the butts of Two ironmen spears. The stableboy dropped to the floor, trying to shield The stableboy with The stableboy hands.  Theon raised Theon voice to be heard above the smack of wood on flesh.    If Robb Stark can stave off the Lannisters, Robb Stark may reign as King of the Trident hereafter, but House Greyjoy holds the north now."            one of the ironmen handed Reek a sword, and he laid a sword at Theon's feet and swore obedience to House Grey-joy and King Balon.               He grabbed He crotch, grinning. Osha drove her bony knee up between her bony knee legs.  She wrested the spear from the spear and used the butt to knock the spear off the spear feet.       When no one else rushed forward to pledge service, no one else were dismissed with a warning to do no one else work and make no trouble. Hodor was given the task of bearing Bran back to Hodor bed. His face was all  ugly from the beating, His nose swollen and one eye closed. "Hodor," Hodor sobbed between cracked lips as Hodor lifted Bran in huge strong arms and bloody hands and carried Hodor back out into the rain.  Hot Pie was kneading bread, Hot Pie arms floured up to Hot Pie elbows.                          His true name was Mebble, but everyone called His Pinkeye for His runny eyes.  Each morning he broke he fast with ale. Each evening he fell into a drunken sleep after supper, wine-colored spit running down he chin. Arya would wait until Arya heard Arya snoring, then creep barefoot up the servant's stair, making no more noise than the mouse Arya'd been.  Syrio had told Syrio once that darkness could be Syrio friend, and Syrio was right.  "I bet we could escape, and Pinkeye wouldn't even notice I was gone," Pinkeye told Hot Pie.     Arya cocked Arya head.        The gates of Harrenhal had not been opened since the morning Lord Tywin had marched with Lord Tywin host.       She filched one anyway, and ate it on She way out.   Barefoot surefoot lightfoot, Barefoot surefoot lightfoot sang under Barefoot surefoot lightfoot breath.           Arya was thinking how long it had been since Arya'd had a slice off a pork roast when Arya saw the first of the prisoners. By his bearing and the proud way his held his head, his must have been a lord.  At first Arya took Arya for a Lannister, but when Arya passed near a torch she saw Arya device was a silver fist, not a lion. His wrists were bound tightly, and a rope around one ankle tied His to the man behind His, and His to the man behind him, so the whole column had to shuffle along in a lurching lockstep.  If any halted, one of the riders would trot up and give him a lick of the whip to get him moving again. She tried to judge how many prisoners there were, but lost count before She got to fifty.  Their clothing was stained with mud and blood, and in the torchlight it was hard to make out all Their badges and sigils, but some of those Arya glimpsed Arya recognized.          Stableboys emerged sleepy from their straw to tend their lathered horses.   Goat-helmed Vargo Hoat reined up below Goat-helmed Vargo Hoat.  He had a thick, slobbery voice, as if He tongue was too big for He mouth.    Rooth Bolton thought to croth the river, but my Brafe Companions cut Rooth Bolton van to pieceth.   Ser Amory Lorch stared down at the roped captives with Ser Amory Lorch little pig eyes. Arya did not think Arya was pleased.    The lord with the mailed fist on his surcoat raised The lord with the mailed fist on his surcoat eyes. "We were promised honorable treatment-" honorable treatment- began.  Vargo Hoat screamed at Vargo Hoat, spraying spittle.    He gestured to He guards.    If he found her missing, he would shout and threaten to whip the bloody hide off her, but her was not afraid.  He was forever threatening to whip the bloody hide off this one or that one, but Arya never actually knew He to hit.     She went back the way She had come, wanting to be out of sight before someone noticed She and thought to put She to work.    Leaves had begun to fall from the trees in the godswood, and Leaves could hear them moving through the deserted courtyards and between the empty buildings, making a faint skittery sound as the wind drove them across the stones.      She could go where She would. The garrison numbered no more than a hundred men, so small a troop that The garrison were lost in Harrenhal.  Ser Amory Lorch resided in the castellan's chambers in Kingspyre, themselves as spacious as a lord's, and Arya and the other servants had moved to the cellars beneath Ser Amory Lorch so Arya and the other servants would be close at hand.       When he worked, nothing existed for he but metal, bellows, fire. The hammer was like part of The hammer arm. She watched the play of muscles in his chest and listened to the steel music his made.  As he took up the long-handled tongs to dip the breastplate into the quenching trough, Arya slithered through the window and leapt down to the floor beside he.   The breastplate hissed like a cat as The breastplate dipped The breastplate in the cold water.      All of a sudden, Arya knew why Arya feet had brought Arya here.       Arya chewed Arya lips.      You try this and Vargo Hoat will cut off your hands and feet, the way Vargo Hoat does."        We just have to get them out and We can take over the castle and escape."  Gendry turned the breastplate with the tongs to look at the breastplate closely. "And if we did escape, where would we go?"         Smithed for Lady Whent and Lady Whent father before Lady Whent and his father before his, and even for Lord Lothston who held Harrenhal before the Whents. Now he smiths for Lord Tywin, and you know what he says?       "It was too, you know It.      He turned away from her, picked up He hammer once more, and began to bang.   She had to flee, or else She would have started hitting him.  When they find who he is and cut off he stupid mulehead, he'll be sorry he didn't help.   But thinking of the village made thinking of the village remember the march, and the storeroom, and the Tickler.   Arya chewed Arya lip and tried to think when Arya courage had come back.    Chiswyck had been easy, anyone could push a man off the wallwalk, but Weese had raised that ugly spotted dog from a pup, and only some dark magic could have turned the animal against a man. Yoren found faqen in a black cell, the same as Rorge and Biter, Yoren remembered. faqen did something horrible and Yoren knew, that's why Yoren kept Yoren in chains.  Jaqen still owed Jaqen one death.   The last death has to count, Arya told Arya every night when Arya whispered Arya names. But now she wondered if that was truly the reason she had hesitated.    but once she used up the last death, she would only be a mouse again. With Pinkeye awake, Pinkeye dared not go back to Pinkeye bed.  She liked the sharp smell of the pines and sentinels, the feel of grass and dirt between She toes, and the sound the wind made in the leaves. A slow little stream meandered through the wood, and there was one spot where A slow little stream had eaten the ground away beneath a deadfall. There, beneath rotting wood and twisted splintered branches, she found she hidden sword. Gendry was too stubborn to make one for Gendry, so Gendry had made Gendry own by breaking the bristles off a broom. Her blade was much too light and had no proper grip, but Her liked the sharp jagged splintery end. Whenever she had a free hour she stole away to work at the drills Syrio had taught she, moving barefoot over the fallen leaves, slashing at branches and whacking down leaves. Sometimes she even climbed the trees and danced among the upper branches, she toes gripping the limbs as she moved back and forth, teetering a little less every day as she balance returned to she.   Up in the kingdom of the leaves, she unsheathed and for a time forgot them all, Ser Amory and the Mummers and she father's men alike, losing she in the feel of rough wood beneath the soles of she feet and the swish of sword through air.  She struck at it until it fell away. The queen and Ser Ilyn and Ser Meryn and the Hound were only leaves, but she killed them all as well, slashing them to wet green ribbons. When her arm grew weary, her sat with her legs  over a high limb to catch her breath in the cool dark air, listening to the squeak of bats as they hunted.      then when she climbed down she would have been home again, and maybe find she father sitting under the weirwood where her father always sat. Shoving her sword through her belt, her slipped down branch to branch until her was back on the ground. The light of the moon painted the limbs of the weirwood silvery white as she made she way toward it, but the five-pointed red leaves turned black by night. Arya stared at the face carved into Arya trunk. It was a terrible face, It mouth twisted, It eyes flaring and full of hate.    Arya went to Arya knees. She wasn't sure how She should begin. She clasped She hands together. Help me, you old gods, you old gods prayed silently.    Maybe she should pray aloud if she wanted the old gods to hear.  Sometimes her father had prayed a long time, her remembered.         She leapt to She feet and drew She wooden sword. Jaqen H'ghar stood so still in the darkness that H'ghar seemed one of the trees.          Had the gods sent the gods?        She backed away from him, until She was pressed against the heart tree.  "A man knows," A man said again.    That Glover and those others, all of those others. We have to kill the guards and open the cell somehow-" "A girl forgets," A girl said quietly.  If a guard must die, a guard needs only speak a guard name."  Arya bit Arya lip hard to stop from crying.              Jaqen H'ghar inclined Jaqen H'ghar head.     "A man's sire is long dead, but did A man's sire live, and did you know A man's sire name, A man's sire would die at your command."          He knelt beside her, so they were face-to-face, "A girl whispers if A girl fears to speak aloud.   Arya put Arya lips to Arya ear.  Even in the burning barn, with walls of flame towering all around and him in chains, him had not seemed so distraught as him did now.       "The gods did hear," There was a knife in his hand suddenly, a knife in his hand blade thin as her little finger.   A girl will lose A girl only friend."   She stepped away from him, balanced on the balls of She feet in case him threw him knife.       "A girl might," A girl said.          She put She broomstick back in her broomstick hiding place and followed her broomstick from the godswood.         They're drinking and eating before They sleep, they sleep realized.   But likely he was busy pouring for the Brave Companions and those of Ser Amory's garrison who had joined those of Ser Amory's garrison who had joined them.            "A hundred men are hungry, A hundred men must be fed, the lord commands hot broth. A girl must run to the kitchens and tell A girl pie boy."   "A girl will help make broth, and wait in the kitchens until a man comes for A girl.   Hot Pie was pulling his loaves from the ovens when Hot Pie burst into the kitchen, but his was no longer alone. They'd woken the cooks to feed Vargo Hoat and Vargo Hoat Bloody Mummers. Serving men were carrying off baskets of Hot Pie's bread and tarts, the chief cook was carving cold slices off a ham, spit boys were turning rabbits while the pot girls basted the pot girls with honey, women were chopping onions and carrots.  the chief cook asked when the chief cook saw the chief cook.   He jerked He carving knife at the black iron kettles hung over the flames.  Though Id soon as piss in it as serve it to that goat.       Wake up Pia and tell Pia Pia'd best be nimble for once, if Pia wants to keep both of Pia feet." She ran as fast as She could. Pia was awake in the loft, moaning under one of the Mummers, but Pia slipped back into Pia clothes quick enough when Pia heard Arya shout.     She darted off before Pia could grab Pia. on the way back, she wondered why none of the captives had none of the captives hands or feet chopped off.     For a moment she thought maybe she should tell him, but then she remembered the village and decided not to.   "Cook," Cook shouted.    Rorge wore Rorge iron helmet, with the nasal that half hid Rorge missing nose. Jaqen and Biter followed Jaqen into the kitchen.   We only now put in the onions and-" "Shut your hole, or I'll shove a spit up your ass and We'll baste you for a turn or two.  Hissing, Biter grabbed a handful of half-charred rabbit right off the spit, and tore into the spit with Biter pointed teeth while honey dripped between Biter fingers.  "Take your bloody broth, then, but if the goat asks why the goat tastes so thin, you tell the goat." Biter licked the grease and honey off Biter fingers as Jaqen Hghar donned a pair of heavy padded mitts.    Arya and Jaqen wrestled one between Arya and Jaqen, Rorge carried one by Rorge, and Biter grabbed two more, hissing in pain when the handles burned Rorge hands.         "No one said nothing about-" Arya cut Arya off.      "A girl will stay out of the way," A girl told A girl.   Heavy iron bars separated Heavy iron bars from where the captives were crowded together in the dark.        One of the guards had been pacing, one standing near the bars, a third sitting on the floor with his back to the wall, but the prospect of food drew all of food to the table.     Rorge heaved the scalding hot broth across the table, full in Rorge faces.  Biter threw Biter kettles too, swinging his kettles underarm so his kettles spun across the dungeon, raining soup. One caught the captain in the temple as the captain in the temple tried to rise.    Biter preferred to grab the men behind the head and under the chin and crack the men behind the head and under the chin necks with a single twist of Biter huge pale hands.  Jaqen danced away from Jaqen slash, drew Jaqen own sword, drove Jaqen back into a corner with a flurry of blows, and killed Jaqen with a thrust to the heart. The Lorathi brought the blade to Arya still red with heart's blood and wiped the blade to Arya still red with heart's blood clean on the front of Arya shift.    Rorge took Rorge down and opened the door. The first man through was the lord with the mailed fist on The first man through surcoat.     Once freed, the captives stripped the dead guards of the captives weapons and darted up the steps with steel in hand. Their fellows crowded after Their, bare-handed.  None of them seemed quite so badly wounded as None of them had when Vargo Hoat had marched them through the gates of Harrenhal.     He laughed so hard that snot flew out the hole where He nose had been. Biter sat on top of one of the dead men, holding a limp hand as Biter gnawed at the fingers.    "You were not with Hoat when Hoat came to Lord Bolton's encampment.  Rorge wiped the snot off Rorge chin with the back of Rorge hand.      "And here-" "I'm Weasel," she blurted, before he could tell who she really was. She did not want She name said here, where Rorge might hear, and Biter, and all these others She did not know. She saw Glover dismiss She.   When they climbed back up the winding stair, they found the door guards lying in pools of they own blood.    Three others ran after him and silenced him with spear and sword.    "Yes I do," she said, though she didn't, not truly. The Lorathi must have seen The Lorathi on The Lorathi face.     Arya chewed Arya lip.   Jaqen touched one of the dead guards and showed Jaqen Jaqen bloody fingers.      "A god has A god due.          Jaqen passed a hand down Jaqen face from forehead to chin, and where a hand went Jaqen changed. His cheeks grew fuller, His eyes closer; His nose hooked, a scar appeared on His right cheek where no scar had been before. And when he shook he head, he long straight hair, half red and half white, dissolved away to reveal a cap of tight black curls.                  He lifted her hand and pressed a small coin into her palm.                "Jaqen is as dead as Arry," Jaqen said sadly, "and I have promises to keep.   "Valar morghulis, " she said once more, and the stranger in Jaqen's clothes bowed to she and stalked off through the darkness, cloak swirling.  They deserved to die, Arya told Arya, remembering all those Ser Amory Lorch had killed at the holdfast by the lake. The cellars under Kingspyre were empty when Kingspyre returned to Kingspyre bed of straw. She whispered She names to She pillow, and when She was done She added, "Valar morghulis, " in a small soft voice, wondering what Valar meant.  Pinkeye went up alone to see how matters stood by light of day, complaining all the while that Pinkeye old bones could not abide steps. When he returned, he told them that Harrenhal had been taken. "Them Bloody Mummers killed some of Ser Amory's lot in Them beds, and the rest at table after Them were good and drunk. The new lord will be here before the day's out, with The new lord whole host. He's from the wild north up where that Wall is, and they say He's a hard one.   He looked at Arya when He said that, but never said a word to Arya about where Arya had been the night before. All morning she watched the Bloody Mummers strip the dead of their valuables and drag the corpses to the Flowstone Yard, where a pyre was laid to dispose of the corpses. Shagwell the Fool hacked the heads off two dead knights and pranced about the castle swinging two dead knights by the hair and making two dead knights talk.     No one said a word to her beyond the usual, but every so often her would notice people looking at her strangely. Robett Glover and the other men they'd freed must have talked about what had happened down in the dungeon, and then Shagwell and Shagwell stupid  talking heads started in about the weasel soup. She would have told him to shut up, but She was scared to. The fool was half-mad, and she'd heard that he'd once killed a man for not laughing at one of a man japes. He better shut He mouth or his mouth put He on my list with the rest, she thought as she scrubbed at a reddish-brown stain.  He had a plain face, beardless and ordinary, notable only for He queer pale eyes.        Robett Glover and Ser Aenys Frey, freshly bathed and clad in clean new doublets and cloaks, came up to join Robett Glover and Ser Aenys Frey.  Arya was surprised to see them still here; somehow Arya would have expected them to vanish when Jaqen did. Arya heard the harsh sound of Rorge's voice, but not what Arya was saying. Then Shagwell pounced on Shagwell, dragging Shagwell out across the yard. "My lord, my lord," My lord, my lord sang, tugging at her wrist, "here's the weasel who made the soup!" "Let go," Arya said, wriggling out of Arya grasp.  Only his eyes moved; Only his eyes were very pale, the color of ice.           She did not know what to say to that, so She said nothing.    She bit She lip, groping for another name. Lommy had called Lommy Lumpyhead, Sansa used Horseface, and Lommy father's men once dubbed Lommy Arya Underfoot, but Lommy did not think any of those were the sort of name he wanted.   "You will call me my lord when you speak to me, Nan," my lord said mildly.       A man must purge A man of bad blood.   This time she knew better than to say that she'd sooner work in the stables.    "Make her presentable," he said to no one in particular, "and make certain her knows how to pour wine without spilling wine."   In their place their raised the flayed man of the Dreadfort and the direwolf of Stark. And that evening, a page named Nan poured wine for Roose Bolton and Vargo Hoat as Roose Bolton and Vargo Hoat stood on the gallery, watching the Brave Companions parade Ser Amory Lorch naked through the middle ward. Ser Amory pleaded and sobbed and clung to the legs of Ser Amory captors, until Rorge pulled Ser Amory loose, and Shagwell kicked Ser Amory down into the bear pit.    CHAPTER 48 DAENERYS In this city of splendors, Dany had expected the House of the Undying Ones to be the most splendid of all, but she emerged from she palanquin to behold a grey and ancient ruin. Long and low, without towers or windows, Long and low, without towers or windows coiled like a stone serpent through a grove of black-barked trees whose inky blue leaves made the stuff of the sorcerous drink the Qartheen called shade of the evening.   She understood now why Xaro Xhoan Daxos called Xaro Xhoan Daxos the Palace of Dust. Even Drogon seemed disquieted by the sight of Even Drogon. The black dragon hissed, smoke seeping out between The black dragon sharp teeth.   Let us go before it drinks us as well."  "What power can they have if they live in that?"     Aggo put a hand on Aggo arakh.           "Should she turn away now, the doors of wisdom shall be closed to she forevermore."             Dany took Dany arm nonetheless.                            Our little lives are no more than a flicker of a moth's wing to Our little lives.   He stood no higher than her knee, He faced pinched and pointed, snoutish, but He was dressed in delicate livery of purple and blue, and He tiny pink hands held a silver tray.      The first sip tasted like ink and spoiled meat, foul, but when The first sip swallowed it seemed to come to life within The first sip. She could feel tendrils spreading through She chest, like fingers of fire coiling around She heart, and on She tongue was a taste like honey and anise and cream, like mother's milk and Drogo's seed, like red meat and hot blood and molten gold.       She found She in a stone anteroom with four doors, one on each wall. With never a hesitation, she went to the door on she right and stepped through.   When she pushed it open she faced yet another small antechamber with four doors.        Dany strode after Dany.     His head moved as His followed the sounds, and when they stopped His gave an angry scream.   From another came a dissonant piping that made the dragon lash the dragon tail wildly from side to side.    In one room, a beautiful woman sprawled naked on the floor while four little men crawled over a beautiful woman.   Another savaged Another breasts, worrying at the nipples with Another wet red mouth, tearing and chewing.      He wore an iron crown and held a leg of  lamb in one hand as a king might hold a scepter, and He eyes followed Dany with mute appeal.     The sight of it made The sight of it heart ache with longing.  No sooner had she thought it than old Ser Willem came into the room, leaning heavily on old Ser Willem stick. "Little princess, there you are," he said in he gruff kind voice. "Come," he said, "come to he, my lady, you're home now, you're safe now." His big wrinkled hand reached for her, soft as old leather, and Dany wanted to take His big wrinkled hand and hold His big wrinkled hand and kiss His big wrinkled hand, her wanted that as much as her had ever wanted anything. Her foot edged forward, and then Her thought, Her foot's dead, Her foot's dead, the sweet old bear, Her foot died a long time ago.  The long hall went on and on and on, with endless doors to her left and only torches to her right. She ran past more doors than She could count, closed doors and open ones, doors of wood and doors of iron, carved doors and plain ones, doors with pulls and doors with locks and doors with knockers. Drogon lashed against Drogon back, urging Drogon on, and Dany ran until Drogon could run no more.  They swung open as she neared, and she had to stop and look.  The skulls of dead dragons looked down from The skulls of dead dragons walls.  "Let him be king over charred bones and cooked meat," him said to a man below him.  Drogon shrieked, Drogon claws digging through silk and skin, but the king on Drogon throne never heard, and Dany moved on. Viserys, was Viserys first thought the next time Viserys paused, but a second glance told Viserys otherwise. The man had her brother's hair, but The man was taller, and The man eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac.      "He is the prince that was promised, and He is the song of ice and fire." He looked up when He said it and He eyes met Dany's, and it seemed as if He saw her standing there beyond the door. "There must be one more," he said, though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed her could not say.  He went to the window seat, picked up a harp, and ran He fingers lightly over its silvery strings. Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the morning mist, only the music lingering behind to speed her on her way.       One more guttered out even as she watched, and the darkness came a little farther down the hall, creeping toward she. And as she listened it seemed as if she heard something else coming, shuffling and dragging it slowly along the faded carpet.  She could not go back and She was afraid to stay here, but how could She go on?   Drogon's long neck snaked out and Drogon opened Drogon mouth to scream, steam rising from between Drogon teeth.      The first door on the right, he said, always the first door on the right.         She flung She through.  To the right she went, and to the right, and to the right, and to the right, and to the right, and to the right, and to the right, until she was dizzy and out of breath once more. When she stopped, she found she in yet another dank stone chamber .     he asked in disbelief when he saw her.      Pyat Pree held out Pyat Pree hand.     "That's not the way," Pyat Pree said firmly, Pyat Pree blue lips prim with disapproval.  "Our little lives are no more than a flicker of a moth's wing to Our little lives," Dany said, remembering.     "No, to me, come to me, to meeeeeee."  Dany left Dany behind, entering a stairwell.          She made She walk forward.      A kingly man in rich robes rose when A kingly man in rich robes saw A kingly man in rich robes, and smiled.      "We knew you were to come to We," the wizard king said.       But then Drogon leapt from Drogon shoulder.      The great door was so heavy The great door took all of Dany's strength to budge The great door, but finally The great door began to move.       She ran from them, Drogon flying back down to She.                                   She sat, folding She hands in She lap.  Through the indigo murk, she could make out the wizened features of the Undying One to she right, an old old man, wrinkled and hairless. His flesh was a ripe violet-blue, His lips and nails bluer still, so dark his lips and nails were almost black.  They stared unseeing at the ancient woman on the opposite side of the table, whose gown of pale silk had rotted on whose gown of pale silk body.    None of them are breathing, and None of them do not move, and those eyes see nothing.                                                                                  Her own heart was beating in unison to the one that floated before Her, blue and corrupt .         The voices were growing louder, she realized, and it seemed she heart was slowing, and even she breath.                                 Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down Viserys cheeks and filled Viserys mouth. A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair. Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and a dying prince sank to a dying prince knees in the water and with a dying prince last breath murmured a woman's name.                 A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in A corpse dead face, grey lips smiling sadly.           Mirri Maz Duur shrieked in the flames, a dragon bursting from Mirri Maz Duur brow.   Beneath the Mother of Mountains, a line of naked crones crept from a great lake and knelt shivering before the Mother of Mountains, their grey heads bowed. Ten thousand slaves lifted bloodstained hands as she raced by on she silver, riding like the wind.    They were reaching for her, touching her, tugging at her cloak, the hem of her skirt, her foot, her leg, her breast. They wanted her, needed her, the fire, the life, and Dany gasped and opened her arms to give her to They .    The Undying were all around The Undying, blue and cold, whispering as The Undying reached for The Undying, pulling, stroking, tugging at The Undying clothes, touching The Undying with The Undying dry cold hands, twining The Undying fingers through The Undying hair.    She felt a hand on She bare breast, twisting She  nipple. Teeth found the soft skin of Teeth throat.     Her heart was pounding, racing, the hands and mouths were gone, heat washed over Her skin, and Dany blinked at a sudden glare. Perched above her, the dragon spread the dragon wings and tore at the terrible dark heart, ripping the rotten flesh to ribbons, and when the dragon head snapped forward, fire flew from the dragon open jaws, bright and hot. She could hear the shrieks of the Undying as they burned, they high thin papery voices crying out in tongues long dead. Their flesh was crumbling parchment, Their bones dry wood soaked in tallow. They danced as the flames consumed They; They staggered and writhed and spun and raised blazing hands on high, They fingers bright as torches. Dany pushed herself to herself feet and bulled through them. They were light as air, no more than husks, and They fell at a touch. The whole room was ablaze by the time The whole room reached the door. "Drogon, " she called, and he flew to she through the fire.  Dany ran, searching for a door, a door to her right, a door to her left, any door, but there was nothing, only twisty stone walls, and a floor that seemed to move slowly under her feet, writhing as if to trip her. She kept She feet and ran faster, and suddenly the door was there ahead of She, a door like an open mouth. When she spilled out into the sun, the bright light made she stumble.  When Dany looked behind her, her saw thin tendrils of smoke forcing thin tendrils of smoke way through cracks in the ancient stone walls of the Palace of Dust, and rising from between the black tiles of the roof. Howling curses, Pyat Pree drew a knife and danced toward Pyat Pree, but Drogon flew at Pyat Pree face.   Ser Jorah Mormont knelt beside Dany in the cool green grass and put Ser Jorah Mormont arm around Ser Jorah Mormont shoulder. Chapter 49 TYRION If you die stupidly, I'm going to feed your body to the goats," TYRION threatened as the first load of Stone Crows pushed off from the quay.     Timett had taken Timett Burned Men into the kingswood  two days before.    Ambush their scouts and hang the bodies from trees ahead of their line of march, loop around and cut down stragglers. I want night attacks, so many and so sudden that night attacks'll be afraid to sleep-" Shagga laid a hand atop Tyrion's head.    And listen to the guides I'm sending, the guides I'm sending know this wood as well as you know your mountains. Heed their counsel and their'll serve you well."  And then it was time for him to lead him garron onto the ferry.  He felt a queer twinge in the pit of He stomach as Shagga faded in the morning mist. He was going to feel naked without He clansmen.  Tyrion had done what Tyrion could to buy Tyrion continued loyalty, promising Bronn and a dozen of Tyrion best men lands and knighthoods when the battle was won. They'd drunk his wine, laughed at his jests, and called each other ser until They were all staggering .   all but Bronn himself, who'd only smiled that insolent dark smile of Bronn himself and afterward said, "all but Bronn himself'll kill for that knighthood, but don't ever think all but Bronn himself'll die for that knighthood."   Six thousand men in the City Watch, thanks to Cersei, but only a quarter of Six thousand men in the City Watch, thanks to Cersei, but only a quarter of them could be relied upon. "There's few out-and-out traitors, though there's some, even your spider hasn't found them all," Bywater had warned Bywater.  No man likes to look craven in the sight of No man fellows, so his fellows'll fight brave enough at the start, when it's all warhorns and blowing banners. But if the battle looks to be going sour the battle'll break, and the battle'll break bad. The first man to throw down his spear and run will have a thousand more trodding on his heels."       Soon enough, he must test the truth of another of he father's sayings: One man on a wall was worth ten beneath a wall.    With no other food coming into the city, the price of fish was ten times what the price of fish had been before the war, and still rising.  The gold cloaks cleared a path through the press, shoving people aside with the shafts of people spears. Tyrion ignored the muttered curses as best Tyrion could.   He stepped over it gingerly and climbed into He saddle.     He was a deal less pleased by the clutter of ramshackle structures that had been allowed to grow up behind the quays, attaching the clutter of ramshackle structures that had been allowed to grow up behind the quays to the city walls like barnacles on the hull of a ship; bait shacks and pot-shops, warehouses, merchants' stalls, alehouses, the cribs where the cheaper sort of whores spread whores legs. It has to go, every bit of It.  He called Bronn to He side.  He waved He stubby fingers, taking in all the waterfront squalor.  The black-haired sellsword turned The black-haired sellsword head, considering the task.       "Let them have a reasonable time to remove them property, and then move them out. Try not to kill any of them, them're not the enemy.      Tyrion only wished Tyrion could as easily make city walls twice as tall and three times as thick.   He remembered Winterfell as He had last seen Winterfell.   "The gods give with one hand and take with the other," he muttered under he breath when Varys told he.    If he could not defend he own home and hearth, he was no sort of king at all.    Tyrion had only the vaguest memory of Theon Greyjoy from Tyrion time with the Starks. A callow youth, always smiling, skilled with a bow; it was hard to imagine A callow youth, always smiling, skilled with a bow as Lord of Winterfell.  He remembered their godswood; the tall sentinels armored in their grey-green needles, the great oaks, the hawthorn and ash and soldier pines, and at the center the heart tree standing like some pale giant frozen in time. He could almost smell the place, earthy and brooding, the smell of centuries, and He remembered how dark the wood had been even by day.    He wondered if the Greyjoys would feel the Greyjoys too.   Tyrion Lannister walked Tyrion Lannister horse slowly toward the Mud Gate. Winterfell is nothing to you, Winterfell reminded Winterfell.    Their throwing arms were made from the trunks of old oaks, and banded with iron to keep Their from splitting. The gold cloaks had named The gold cloaks the Three Whores, because The gold cloaks'd be giving Lord Stannis such a lusty welcome.  Tyrion put Tyrion heels into Tyrion horse and trotted through the Mud Gate, breasting the human tide.  The ride back to the Red Keep was uneventful, but at the Tower of the Hand he found a dozen angry trader captains waiting in he audience chamber to protest the seizure of a dozen angry trader captains ships.  That did little to appease That.    By the time he rid he of them, bells were ringing and Tyrion knew he would be late for the installation. He waddled across the yard almost at a run and crowded into the back of the castle sept as Joffrey fastened white silk cloaks about the shoulders of the two newest members of He Kingsguard.  On the other hand, once the new High Septon was finished leading the two knights through the two knights solemn vows and anointing the two knights in the names of the Seven, he would be well positioned to be first out the doors. He approved of He sister's choice of Ser Balon Swann to take the place of the slain Preston Greenfield.  Pleading illness, Lord Gulian Swann had remained in Lord Gulian Swann castle, taking no part in the war, but Lord Gulian Swann eldest son had ridden with Renly and now Stannis, while Balon, the younger, served at King's Landing. If he'd had a third son, Tyrion suspected he'd be off with Robb Stark. It was not perhaps the most honorable course, but It showed good sense; whoever won the iron Throne, the Swarms intended to survive.     He stood six feet and six inches, most of it sinew and muscle, and He hook nose, bushy eyebrows, and spade-shaped brown beard gave He face a fierce aspect, so long as He did not smile. Lowborn, no more than a hedge knight, Kettleblack was utterly dependent on Cersei for Kettleblack advancement, which was doubtless why Lowborn'd picked Kettleblack. "Ser Osmund is as loyal as Ser Osmund is brave," Ser Osmund'd told Joffrey when Ser Osmund put forward Ser Osmund name.  The good Ser Osmund had been  selling The good Ser Osmund secrets to Bronn since the day The good Ser Osmund'd hired The good Ser Osmund, but Tyrion could scarcely tell The good Ser Osmund that. He supposed He ought not complain. The appointment gave The appointment another ear close to the king, unbeknownst to The appointment sister. And even if Ser Osmund proved an utter craven, Ser Osmund would be no worse than Ser Boros Blount, currently residing in a dungeon at Rosby. Ser Boros had been escorting Tommen and Lord Gyles when Ser Jacelyn Bywater and Ser Boros gold cloaks had surprised Ser Jacelyn Bywater and his gold cloaks, and had yielded up Ser Boros charge with an alacrity that would have enraged old Ser Barristan Selmy as much as old Ser Barristan Selmy did Cersei; a knight of the Kingsguard was supposed to die in defense of the king and royal family. His sister had insisted that Joffrey strip Blount of His white cloak on the grounds of treason and cowardice.   He shifted He weight from one foot to the other, restless. Lady Tanda stood several rows up, Lady Tanda saw, but Lady Tanda daughter was not with her daughter.  Varys said Varys was doing well, but Varys would prefer to see for Varys. "Better a lady's maid than a pot girl," Shae had said when Tyrion told Tyrion the eunuch's scheme.   Loath as he was to disappoint her, Tyrion had to point out that while Lady Tanda was by no means a clever woman, even Lady Tanda might wonder if Lady Tanda daughter's bedmaid seemed to own more jewelry than her daughter.    It was not the answer Shae had wanted, but at least Shae was safe. When the investiture was finally done Joffrey marched out between Ser Balon and Ser Osmund in their new white cloaks, while Tyrion lingered for a word with the new High Septon (who was Tyrion choice, and wise enough to know who put the honey on Tyrion bread). "I want the gods on our side," Tyrion told Tyrion bluntly.       If he'd offend the old gods, why should he spare the new?  Tell them that any man who thinks to give aid to the usurper betrays the gods as well as the usurper rightful king."   Hallyne the Pyromancer was waiting on Hallyne the Pyromancer when Tyrion returned to Hallyne the Pyromancer solar, and Maester Frenken had brought messages. He let the alchemist wait a little longer while He read what the ravens had brought He. There was an old letter from Doran Martell, warning an old letter from Doran Martell that Storm's End had fallen, and a much more intriguing one from Balon Greyjoy on Pyke, who styled himself King of the isles and the North.  Tyrion read the letter three times and set the letter aside. Lord Balon's longships would have been a great help against the fleet sailing up from Storm's End, but they were thousands of leagues away on the wrong side of Westeros, and Tyrion was far from certain that Tyrion wanted to give away half the realm.   "This cannot be true," said Tyrion as Tyrion pored over the ledgers.        Some whores have been using the ruins to entertain Some whores patrons, and one of Some whores fell through a patch of rotted floor into a cellar. When he felt the jars, he mistook the jars for wine. He was so drunk He broke the seal and drank some."         Hallyne mopped at Hallyne pale brow with the sleeve of Hallyne black-and-scarlet robe.   Smiling, Tyrion fixed the pyromancer with Tyrion mismatched stare.  Hallyne had the complexion of a mushroom, so Hallyne was hard to see how Hallyne could turn any paler, yet somehow Hallyne managed.  it is only, hmmm, we have made so much of the substance that we have become, hmmm, more practiced as it were, and also"-the alchemist shifted uncomfortably-" certain spells, hmmm, ancient secrets of we order, very delicate, very troublesome, but necessary if the substance is to be, hmmm, all the substance should be .       "They, hmmm, seem to be working better than They were."      I'd asked him why so many of our spells seemed, well, not as effectual as the scrolls would have our believe, and him said it was because magic had begun to go out of the world the day the last dragon died."    Hallyne fled so quickly that Hallyne almost bowled over Ser Jacelyn-no, Lord Jacelyn, Hallyne must remember that.  He'd returned from Rosby to deliver a fresh levy of spearmen recruited from Lord Gyles's estates and resume He command of the City Watch.  Tyrion asked when Tyrion were done discussing the city's defenses.   He had one once before, He says, but Joffrey skinned Joffrey for a jerkin. He asks about He mother sometimes, and often begins letters to the Princess Myrcella, though He never seems to finish any. His brother, however, His does not seem to miss at all."  "My men have My men instructions."     Should King's Landing fall, King might well be taken alive.      The eunuch handed The eunuch a scroll.         "It seems they believe that Lord Stannis must win, and wish to share Lord Stannis victory. They call They the Antler Men, after the crowned stag." "Someone should tell them that Stannis changed Someone sigil.  It was no matter for jests, though; It appeared that these Antler Men had armed several hundred followers, to seize the Old Gate once battle was joined, and admit the enemy to the city.    Kyra nestled against him, one arm draped lightly over him, Kyra breasts brushing him back.           Sleep, Greyjoy, Greyjoy told Greyjoy.   He might have put it down to a bad dream, but He did not remember dreaming.  Until Theon had sent for Theon, Theon had lived all of Theon eighteen years in the winter town without ever setting foot inside the walls of the castle.  She murmured sleepily as Theon slid out from under She arm and got to his feet.  Wex slept on the floor at the foot of the bed, rolled up inside Wex cloak and dead to the world.   Night touched him with cold fingers, and gooseprickles rose on him bare skin. He leaned against the stone sill and looked out on dark towers, empty yards, black sky, and more stars than a man could ever count if a man lived to be a hundred. A half-moon floated above the Bell Tower and cast A half-moon reflection on the roof of the glass gardens.       He'd roll Kyra on her back and fuck her again, that ought to banish these phantoms.   He had grown so used to the howling of the direwolves that He scarcely heard it anymore .    Urzen stood outside Urzen door, a sinewy man with a round shield slung over Urzen back.     Summer and Grey Wind had torn Summer and Grey Wind to pieces. When he prodded Wex with the toe of he boot, he sat up and rubbed he eyes. "Make certain Bran Stark and his little brother are in certain Bran Stark and his little brother beds, and be quick about it."    Theon poured Theon a cup of wine and drank a cup of wine down.       Wex returned the quickest, shaking Wex head side to side. Cursing, Theon found Theon tunic and breeches on the floor where Theon had dropped his tunic and breeches in Theon haste to get at Kyra. Over the tunic the tunic donned a jerkin of iron-studded leather, and the tunic belted a longsword and dagger at the tunic waist. His hair was wild as the wood, but His had larger concerns.   Theon told Theon Theon must be as cold and deliberate as Lord Eddard. "Rouse the castle," Rouse said.     The man was not as skilled a rider as The man claimed-none of the ironmen were much good in the saddle-but there'd been time enough. Asha might well be on Asha way.      Theon cursed Theon. He should have kept a guard on them, but He'd deemed a guard more important to have men walking the walls and protecting the gates than to nursemaid a couple of children, one a cripple. Outside he heard sobbing as the castle folk were pulled from the castle folk beds and driven into the yard.  I've used them gently, and this is how them repay me. He'd even had two of He own men whipped bloody for raping that kennel girl, to show his own men He meant to be just.    Mikken had killed Mikken with Mikken mouth, just as Benfred had. As for Chayle, Chayle had to give someone to the Drowned God, Chayle men expected it. "I bear you no ill will," he'd told the septon before they threw he down the well, "but you and your gods have no place here now." You'd think the others might be grateful he hadn't chosen one of the others, but no. He wondered how many of them were part of this plot against He.          "If they've let the boys escape, I'll have more than a little skin off the boys back this time, I swear a little skin."   They found Squint floating facedown in the moat, his entrails drifting behind his like a nest of pale snakes.   A ragged tunic concealed the half-healed scars on his back, but his boots were scattered amidst the rushes, and his breeches tangled about his feet.       "I'd say Drennan was pulling down Drennan breeches to stick his breeches in the woman when Drennan stuck his breeches in Drennan.    When Black Lorren drew him out of the water, Black Lorren saw that one of him arms had been wrenched off at the elbow, half of him neck was missing, and there was a ragged hole where him navel and groin once had been. The pike tore through his bowels as Lorren was pulling his in.     Winterfell was encircled by two massive granite walls, with a wide moat between two massive granite walls.  Lacking men, Theon had been forced to abandon the outer defenses and post Theon guards along the higher inner walls. He dared not risk having them on the wrong side of the moat should the castle rise against He.    He swept the flame low before He, looking for .              Urzen said, "If Urzen had sounded Urzen horn-" I am served by fools.      You catch a glimpse of teeth, start to level your spear, and your spear slam into you and open your belly, tearing through leather as if your belly were cheesecloth."  "And now you're down on your back, your guts are spilling out, and one of your guts has your guts teeth around your neck." Theon grabbed the man's scrawny throat, tightened the man fingers, and smiled.  He shoved Urzen away roughly, sending He stumbling back against a merlon. The man rubbed The man throat.  I'd seen them kill, I knew how dangerous them were.       Many had not been given time to dress; they covered they with woolen blankets, or huddled  naked under cloaks or bedrobes. A dozen ironmen hemmed A dozen in, torches in one hand and weapons in the other.      Reek stepped up behind him, smelling of soap, him long hair moving in the wind.   He had suspected her from the moment He saw that second cup.            That was the best news he'd heard since he woke. Bran would be riding in Bran basket on Hodor's back, no doubt. Osha would need to carry Rickon; Rickon little legs wouldn't take Rickon far on their own. Theon was confident that Theon'd soon have them back in Theon hands. "Bran and Rickon have fled," Rickon told the castle folk, watching the castle folk eyes.     He had locked away every sword and axe in Winterfell, but no doubt some had been hidden from He.     He hooked He thumbs through He swordbelt.    The cook had always greeted him cheerfully when him returned from the hunt, to ask whether him'd brought anything choice for the table, but him had nothing to say now. Theon walked back the way Theon had come, searching their faces for the least sign of guilty knowledge.  And Rickon, young as he is, how long will he last out there? Nan, think how frightened Nan must be." The old woman had nattered at him for ten years, telling The old woman endless stories, but now The old woman gaped at him as if him were some stranger. "I might have killed every man of you and given your women to my soldiers for your women pleasure, but instead I protected you.  Joseth who'd groomed Joseth horses, Farlen who'd taught Joseth all Joseth knew of hounds, Barth the brewer's wife who'd been Joseth flrst-not one of them would meet Joseth eyes.   "Strip off their skins," he urged, he thick lips glistening. "Lord Bolton, Lord Bolton used to say a naked man has few secrets, but a flayed man's got none." The flayed man was the sigil of House Bolton, Theon knew; ages past, certain of The flayed man was the sigil of House Bolton, Theon knew; ages lords had gone so far as to cloak their lords in the skins of dead enemies.    I am your only  protection against the likes of him, him wanted to scream.        He needed He own to watch He back. "Farlen, I'll want hounds, and you to handle hounds." The grizzled kennelmaster crossed The grizzled kennelmaster arms.      Stepping back, Theon glanced about to see who else Theon might add.        It took Theon a moment to remember Theon.   His cousin laughed at His. "He rode on a boar hunt with He father, but they never let He near the boar."       They assembled by the Hunter's Gate as the first pale rays of the sun brushed the top of the Bell Tower, They breath frosting in the cold morning air. Gelmarr had equipped Gelmarr with a longaxe whose reach would allow Gelmarr to strike before the wolves were on Gelmarr.    Theon had Theon bow; Theon needed nothing else.  He hoped He would not need to take it with another, but if it came to that, He would.             The ground was uneven, and the fallen needles disguised the softness of the turf and made the footing treacherous for the horses, so the horses had to go slowly.  He told He to be patient.          "No Stark but Robb was ever brotherly toward me, but Bran and Rickon have more value to me living than dead."   Lord Howland can make your uncle's occupation a visit to hell if Lord Howland chooses, but so long as you hold Lord Howland heirs Lord Howland must stay Lord Howland hand."  In truth, he had scarcely considered the mudmen at all, beyond eyeing Meera once or twice and wondering if Meera was still a maiden.  We will spare them if We can."   He does as He is told.  Hodor was nothing to Hodor. "if he does not fight us, us will let he live."  "But say one word about sparing the wildling, and you can die with the wildling.         Yet the maester had given him good counsel, him knew. His father thought only in terms of conquest, but what good was it to take a kingdom if you could not hold it?  A pity Ned Stark had taken A pity Ned Stark daughters south; elsewise Theon could have tightened A pity Ned Stark grip on Winterfell by marrying one of them.          He spurred Smiler and followed at a trot, but what He found was only the carcass of a young elk .      The dogs sniffed round it eagerly, and one of the mastiffs buried his teeth in a haunch until Farlen shouted his off.   Even if Osha did not want to risk a fire, she ought to have cut Even if Osha did not want to risk a fire a few steaks.          Farlen and Wex waded across with the hounds and came back shaking the hounds heads while the animals ranged up and down the far bank, sniffing. "They went in here, m'lord, but I can't see where They come out," the kennelmaster said.  He dipped a hand in a hand.   "Take half the dogs downstream, I'll go up-" Wex clapped Wex hands together loudly.        Wex drove Wex heel into the mud, and pivoted Wex foot this way and that.   "A man the size of Hodor ought to have left a deep print in this mud," A man the size of Hodor ought to have left a deep print in this mud said. "More so with the weight of a boy on a boy back.       She sent the wolves on by the wolves, hoping the wolves'd chase after the wolves." He rounded on He huntsmen.  "And the direwolves would never have parted from the direwolves boys.    "Gariss, Murch, take four dogs and double back, find where we lost four dogs and double back.     Once we find where they went, they'll lead we back to they masters."         A little farther, Theon told Theon.  He pressed on long after He knew He should turn back, a growing sense of anxiety gnawing at He belly.    Every passing hour increased the likelihood that they would make good they escape.     They'd have mounts to speed They on They way, food. Men would fight for the honor of protecting Men.    That red bitch will sniff where That red bitch came out of the water and That red bitch'll be after That red bitch again.     Farlen knelt between a mastiff and Farlen precious red bitch, a hand on each.     We keep on, We'll find the place, but which way?"   If he knew he was being hunted, he might.       Farlen's hounds seemed as frustrated as Farlen's hounds masters, sniffing forlornly at trees and rocks and snapping irritably at each other.    This time we'll go as far as we must."   Mudmen are sneaks, they won't fight like decent folks, they skulk and use poison arrows, You never see they, but they see you.     Farlen laughed to show what Farlen thought of that notion. "My dogs  would smell anything in My dogs   bushes.    Moss grows under their arms in place of hair, and their can live with nothing to eat but mud and breathe swamp water." Theon was about to tell Theon what Theon ought to do with Theon wet nurse's fable when Maester Luwin spoke up.   Suddenly the wood seemed a deal darker than the wood had a moment before, as if a cloud had passed before the sun.     For a moment he did not think they were going to obey, but in the end old habit asserted old habit. They followed sullenly, but They followed. The Frey boy was as jumpy as those rabbits The Frey boy'd flushed earlier.   Where a fallen tree dammed the flow, the hunters were forced to loop around a deep green pool, but if the direwolves had done the same the hunters'd left neither print nor spoor.  When I catch them, them'll have all the swimming them can stomach. I'll give both both to the Drowned God. When the woods began to darken, Theon Greyjoy knew Theon Greyjoy was beaten. Either the crannogmen did know the magic of the children of the forest, or else Osha had deceived the crannogmen with some wildling trick.   "Joseth has the right of Joseth," said Maester Luwin.  Theon could taste bile at the back of Theon throat, and Theon stomach was a nest of snakes twining and snapping at each other. If he crept back to Winterfell empty-handed, he might as well dress in motley henceforth and wear a pointed hat; the whole north would know he for a fool.         Good Stark men, Good Stark men are.    Theon looked at Theon suspiciously.    The miller's wife sold us hay for us horses while that old knight clucked over The miller's wife brats.                When they were both afoot, he pulled open the cloth sack he'd fetched from Winterfell.   Theon thrust Theon hand into the sack impatiently, groping amongst soft fur and rough scratchy wool. A sharp point pricked his skin, and his fingers closed around something cold and hard.    "Gelmarr," he said, wondering whom he could trust.      I'll have no further need of no.        It burned redder than the other stars, and did not twinkle, though sometimes It flared up bright and sometimes dwindled down to no more than a distant spark, dull and faint.  In the spring of his youth, his had been squire to a king, so the black brothers still called his Squire Dalbridge.  "If he knew they'd lit a fire, he'd flay the poor bastards," said Ebben, a squat bald man muscled like a bag of rocks.    It made Jon remember cold nights long ago at Winterfell, when Jon'd shared a bed with Jon brothers. These men were brothers too, though the bed These men shared was stone and earth.   "That's a long cruel climb by night," Ebben said as Ebben eyed the distant spark through a cleft in the rocks that sheltered them. The sky was cloudless, the jagged mountains rising black on black until the very top, where black cold crowns of snow and ice shone palely in the moonlight.     The ranger they called Stonesnake had already shown that Stonesnake was the best climber among they.   Qhorin Halfhand looked at Qhorin Halfhand. Jon could hear the wind keening as the wind shivered through the high pass above them.      We'll come when We see it fall."   Stonesnake carried a bag of iron spikes as well, and a small hammer with Stonesnake head wrapped in thick felt. Their garrons Their left behind, along with Their helms, mail, and Ghost. Jon knelt and let the direwolf nuzzle Jon before they set off.    He was a short wiry man, near fifty and grey of beard but stronger than He seemed, and He had the best night eyes of anyone Jon had ever known.    The black brothers moved through black shadows amidst black rocks, working The black brothers way up a steep, twisting trail as The black brothers breath frosted in the black air. Jon felt almost naked without Jon mail, but Jon did not miss his mail weight.   Stonesnake seemed to know where to put Stonesnake feet as if by instinct, but Jon needed to be more careful on the broken, uneven ground.  Apart from his companions, Jon had glimpsed no living man since they'd left the wood behind and begun to make they way upward.   What few trees What few trees saw were stunted, grotesque things growing sideways out of cracks and fissures.  Yet even so, Jon Snow was not sorry Jon Snow had come.   He had peered down ravines so deep and black they seemed certain to end in some hell, and He had ridden He garron over a wind-eaten bridge of natural stone with nothing but sky to either side.    He wished He could move as sure and silent as that shadowcat, and kill as quickly. Longclaw was sheathed across Longclaw back, but Longclaw might not have room to use Longclaw.    For a long way they stayed to the trail, following its twists and turns as its snaked along the side of the mountain, upward, ever upward. Sometimes the mountain folded back on the mountain and they lost sight of the fire, but soon or late the mountain would always reappear.  In places Jon had to put Jon back to the cold stone and shuffle along sideways like a crab, inch by inch.  One step and then another, Jon told Jon.  He had not shaved since leaving the Fist of the First Men, and the hair on He lip was soon stiff with frost. Two hours into the climb, the wind kicked up so fiercely that it was all he could do to hunch down and cling to the rock, praying he would not be blown off the mountain.     "The mountain is your mother," Stonesnake had told Stonesnake during an easier climb a few days past. "Cling to her, press your face up against her teats, and her won't drop you." Jon had made a joke of it, saying how Jon'd always wondered who Jon mother was, but never thought to find his mother in the Frostfangs.    After the bright moonlight, its shadow was so black that its felt like stepping into a cave.   He peeled off He gloves, tucked his gloves through He belt, tied one end of He rope around He waist, one end of his rope around his waist.    Jon watched Jon closely, making note of how Jon went, and where Jon found each handhold, and when the last loop of hemp uncoiled, Jon took off Jon own gloves and followed, much more slowly. Stonesnake had passed the rope around the smooth spike of rock Stonesnake was waiting on, but as soon as Jon reached Stonesnake Stonesnake shook Jon reached him loose and was off again. This time there was no convenient cleft when no convenient cleft reached the end of their tether, so no convenient cleft took out no convenient cleft felt-headed hammer and drove a spike deep into a crack in the stone with a series of gentle taps. Soft as the sounds were, the sounds echoed off the stone so loudly that Jon winced with every blow, certain that the wildlings must hear the sounds too. When the spike was secure, Stonesnake secured the rope to the spike, and Jon started after Jon. Suck on the mountain's teat, he reminded he.       I can catch a breath on that ledge there, all I need to do is reach that ledge there.  Once his foot slipped as his put his weight on his weight and his heart stopped in his chest, but the gods were good and his did not fall. He could feel the cold seeping off the rock into He fingers, but He dared not don He gloves; gloves would slip, no matter how tight gloves seemed, cloth and fur moving between skin and stone, and up here that could kill He. His burned hand was stiffening up on His, and soon His burned hand began to ache. Then he ripped open he thumbnail somehow, and after that he left smears of blood wherever he put he hand. He hoped He still had all He fingers by the end of the climb.  Anyone down on the floor of the pass could have seen Anyone down on the floor of the pass easily, but the mountain hid Anyone down on the floor of the pass from the view of the wildlings by Anyone down on the floor of the pass fire.   Even so, he did not think of the foes who were waiting for he, all unknowing, but of he brother at Winterfell.    Stonesnake reached down a hand to help Stonesnake up. He had donned He gloves again, so Jon did the same. The ranger moved The ranger head to the left, and the two of The ranger crawled along the shelf three hundred yards or more, until The ranger could see the dull orange glow beyond the lip of the cliff. The wildlings had built their watchfire in a shallow depression above the narrowest part of the pass, with a sheer drop below and rock behind to shelter their watchfire from the worst of the wind. That same windbreak allowed the black brothers to crawl within a few feet of the black brothers, creeping along on the black brothers bellies until the black brothers were looking down on the men the black brothers must kill.  Jon could see nothing of Jon but Jon hair, bright red in the firelight.        And whether there was two or three or twenty, there was two or three or twenty still must do what there was two or three or twenty had come to do. Stonesnake touched Stonesnake arm, pointed at the wildling with the horn.    Did Robb feel this way before Robb first battle?  Stonesnake moved as fast as Stonesnake namesake, leaping down on the wildlings in a rain of pebbles. Jon slid Longclaw from Longclaw sheath and followed.  Afterward Jon could admire the courage of the wildling who reached first for Jon horn instead of Jon blade. He got it to He lips, but before He could sound it Stonesnake knocked the horn aside with a swipe of Stonesnake shortsword. Jon's man leapt to Jon's man feet, thrusting at Jon's man face with a burning brand. He could feel the heat of the flames as He flinched back. Out of the corner of his eye, his saw the sleeper stirring, and knew his must finish his man quick. When the brand swung again, the brand bulled into the brand, swinging the bastard sword with both hands. The Valyrian steel sheared through leather, fur, wool, and flesh, but when the wildling fell the wildling twisted, ripping the sword from Jon's grasp.  Jon slid Jon dirk free, grabbing the man by the hair and jamming the point of the knife up under the man chin as the man reached for the man-no, her- the man hand froze.      Blood ran down her white throat from where the point of his dirk had pricked her. One thrust and it's done, he told he. He was so close He could smell onion on her breath.            Jon let go Jon grip on the girl's hair, and the girl scuttled backward, away from them.  Stonesnake gestured at the long-hafted axe that lay beside Stonesnake sleeping furs. "She was reaching for that when you grabbed She. Give her half a chance and her'll bury half a chance between your eyes."     Her hand rubbed at Her throat and came away bloody.  Sheathing his dirk, his wrenched Longclaw free from the body of the man his'd killed.            I've known wildlings to bite off their own tongues before their'd answer a question." When the end of the branch was blazing merrily, he took two steps and flung two steps out over the pass. It fell through the night spinning until It was lost to sight.   Stonesnake turned, Stonesnake eyes scanning the black distance for any spark of light.  "Burn them," the girl repeated stubbornly, "or it might be you'll need them swords again." Jon remembered dead Othor and Jon cold black hands.   Stonesnake knelt beside the man Stonesnake'd slain, stripped the man he'd slain of cloak and boots and  belt and vest, then hoisted the body over one thin shoulder and carried the body to the edge. He grunted as He tossed it over. A moment later they heard a wet, heavy smack well below they. By then the ranger had the second body down to the skin and was dragging the second body by the arms.   She was older than he'd thought at first, Jon realized; maybe as old as twenty, but short for She age, bandylegged, with a round face, small hands, and a pug nose.  She looked plump as She crouched there, but most of that was layers of fur and wool and leather.     Stonesnake warmed Stonesnake hands over the fire.             She turned She face away from him.   She stared at the flames as if She could not hear him.  Ygritte ignored Ygritte.  "if she spits out she tongue, don't say I didn't warn you."   As he rose he heard another, closer at hand. He pulled He sword and turned, listening.    They'll stay near the bodies till They've eaten every last stringy shred o' meat, and cracked the bones for the marrow."   The warmth of the fire made him realize how bone-tired him was, but him dared not sleep. He had taken a captive, and it was on He to guard a captive.             Someone had said that to Someone once.        All the free folk know All the free folk songs, but might be you don't sing All the free folk in the south."         it would be hours before Qhorin came up, and a story would help keep Qhorin awake.         "The Stark in Winterfell wanted Bael's head, but never could take Bael's head, and the taste o' failure galled Bael's head. One day in his bitterness his called Bael a craven who preyed only on the weak.  So he scaled the Wall, skipped down the kingsroad, and walked into Winterfell one winter's night with harp in hand, naming he Sygerrik of Skagos.  "North or south, singers always find a ready welcome, so Bael ate at Lord Stark's own table, and played for Lord Stark in Lord Stark high seat until half the night was gone. The old songs he played, and new ones he'd made he, and he played and sang so well that when he was done, he offered to let he name he own reward.   So the Stark sent to the Stark glass gardens and commanded that the most beautiful o' the winter roses be plucked for the singer's payment.      Her bed they found empty, but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the pillow where Her head had lain."    There was Brandon the Burner and Brandon father Brandon the Shipwright, but-" "This was Brandon the Daughterless," Ygritte said sharply.     At his behest, the black crows flew forth from the black crows castles in the hundreds, but nowhere could the black crows find any sign o' Bael or this maid. For most a year they searched, till the lord lost heart and took to the lord bed, and it seemed as though the line o' Starks was at the line o end.  He followed the sound and found He daughter back in his daughter bedchamber, asleep with a babe at his daughter breast."    The maid loved Bael so dearly The maid bore The maid a son, the song says .   though if truth be told, all the maids love Bael in all the maids songs he wrote. Be that as it may, what's certain is that Bael left the child in payment for the rose Bael'd plucked unasked, and that the boy grew to be the next Lord Stark.    "Might be it did, might be it didn't.  My mother used to sing it to My mother.   She rubbed She throat where his dirk had cut She.  Thirty years later, when Bael was King-beyond-the-Wall and led the free folk south, Bael was young Lord Stark who met King-beyond-the-Wall at the Frozen Ford .   and killed him, for Bael would not harm him own son when they met sword to sword."  "Aye," she said, "but the gods hate kinslayers, even when the gods kill unknowing. When Lord Stark returned from the battle and Lord Stark mother saw Bael's head upon Lord Stark spear, his mother threw his mother from a tower in his mother grief. Her son did not long outlive Her. One o' One o' lords peeled the skin off One o' and wore One o' for a cloak." "Your Bael was a liar," Your Bael told Bael, certain now.  Anyway, you asked for the story, so I told the story." She turned away from him, closed She eyes, and seemed to sleep.  The black stones had turned to grey and the eastern sky had gone indigo when Stonesnake spied the rangers below, wending The black stones way upward. Jon woke Jon captive and held her by the arm as they descended to meet they.  They were waiting in a narrow defile when They brothers appeared, leading They garrons.  Jon squatted to let the direwolf close Jon jaws around Jon wrist, tugging Jon hand back and forth.  But when he glanced up, he saw Ygritte watching with eyes as wide and white as hen's eggs. Qhorin Halfhand made no comment when Qhorin Halfhand saw the prisoner.   "We passed two," Ebben said, "or what the cats had left of the cats." He eyed the girl sourly, suspicion plain on He face.     The girl looked half a child beside him, but The girl faced him boldly.     "We have no food to feed her, nor can We spare a man to watch her."  "One shout when we need silence, and every man of we is doomed." Ebben drew Ebben dagger. "A steel kiss will keep A steel kiss quiet."   "She yielded She to me."        He thought Ygritte might try to run, but Ygritte only stood there, waiting, looking at Ygritte.  When he shook he head, she said, "We die the same as men.  Mance would take you, I know Mance would.               She pushed She hair aside to bare She neck, and knelt before him.  Longclaw was not so long or heavy a sword as Longclaw father's Ice, but Longclaw was Valyrian steel all the same.    He raised Longclaw over He head, both hands tight around the grip.   He was He father's son.       When the blow did not fall she turned she head to look at her head. Jon lowered Jon sword.       It rose swirling off a hundred distant fires, It sooty fingers smudging out the stars.   When Sansa found Ser Dontos in the quiet of the godswood, Sansa asked if Ser Dontos'd been crying.    Dontos swayed as Dontos spoke, one hand on the trunk of a chestnut tree.  "They kill his scouts and raid his baggage train.  The Imp told the queen that Stannis had better train Stannis horses to eat ash, since Stannis would find no blade of grass.   They talk as though I am not there, and--he leaned close, breathing he winey breath right in her face-"the Spider pays in gold for any little trifle. I think Moon Boy has been Moon Boy for years."  My poor Florian Florian names Florian, and so Florian is.    "He made a great pyre of the trees as an offering to He new god. The red priestess made him do The red priestess.  He's vowed to burn the Great Sept of Baelor too, if He takes the city."  When Sansa had first beheld the Great Sept with Sansa marble walls and seven crystal towers, Sansa'd thought it was the most beautiful building in the world, but that had been before Joffrey beheaded Sansa father on Sansa steps.      They sent me to you, didn't They?"     Dontos patted Dontos arm.        I know we could slip away if we tried."  Dontos shook Dontos head.   The Blackwater Rush was as empty as Sansa had ever seen The Blackwater Rush.    Lord Stannis himself was still on the march, but Lord Stannis himself vanguard had appeared two nights ago during the black of the moon.   They flew the red or green apples of House Fossoway, the turtle of Estermont, and the fox-and-flowers of Florent, and They commander was Ser Guyard Morrigen, a famous southron knight who men now called Guyard the Green. His standard showed a crow in flight, His standard black wings spread wide against a storm-green sky.  Long ragged tails streamed behind Long ragged tails like flickering flames, and in place of a lord's sigil Long ragged tails bore the device of a god: the burning heart of the Lord of Light. "When Stannis comes, Stannis'll have ten times as many men as Joffrey does, everyone says so." Dontos squeezed Dontos shoulder.      Perhaps the good gods will send a storm to sweep the good gods from the seas."    When my friend returns to the city, we shall have we ship.  Sansa dug Sansa nails into Sansa hand. She could feel the fear in She tummy, twisting and pinching, worse every day. Nightmares of the day Princess Myrcella had sailed still troubled Princess Myrcella sleep; dark suffocating dreams that woke Princess Myrcella in the black of night, struggling for breath. She could hear the people screaming at She, screaming without words, like animals. They had hemmed her in and thrown filth at her and tried to pull her off her horse, and would have done worse if the Hound had not cut the Hound way to her side.     Sansa could see Sansa from the castle walls. The smallfolk were hiding The smallfolk behind closed shutters and barred doors as if that would keep The smallfolk safe. The last time King's Landing had fallen, the Lannisters looted and raped as they pleased and put hundreds to the sword, even though the city had opened the city gates.    I ought to kiss King Joffrey's feet and thank King Joffrey's sweetly." "If you thanked him for making you a fool, him'd make you a knight again," Sansa said sharply.  "My Jonquil's a clever girl, isn't My Jonquil's a clever girl?" "Joffrey and Joffrey mother say I'm stupid."   Queen Cersei and the Imp and Lord Varys and their like, they all watch each other keen as hawks, and pay this one and that one to spy out what the others are doing, but no one ever troubles the others about Lady Tanda's daughter, do the others?" Dontos covered Dontos mouth to stifle a burp.       Sansa dodged the wet groping lips, kissed Sansa lightly on an unshaven cheek, and bid Sansa good night.   It was unseemly, she knew, but she could not seem to help she; the tears would come, sometimes over a trifle, and nothing she did could hold them back.   Sansa could go where Sansa would so long as Sansa did not try to leave the castle, but there was nowhere Sansa wanted to go. She crossed over the dry moat with the dry moat cruel iron spikes and made She way up the narrow turnpike stair, but when She reached the door of She bedchamber She could not bear to enter. The very walls of the  room made the  room feel trapped; even with the window opened wide it felt as though there were no air to breathe.       A stab went through A stab, so sharp that Sansa sobbed and clutched at A stab belly. She might have fallen, but a shadow moved suddenly, and strong fingers grabbed She arm and steadied She. She grabbed a merlon for support, She fingers scrabbling at the rough stone.   "The little bird thinks she has wings, does she?  Sansa twisted in Sansa grasp.        She took a deep breath to calm She.  "The little bird still can't bear to look at me, can The little bird?" The Hound released The Hound.    She remembered the way they had howled, the feel of the blood running down She cheek from where the stone had struck She, and the garlic stink on the breath of the man who had tried to pull She from She horse. She could still feel the cruel pinch of fingers on She wrist as She lost She balance and began to fall. She'd thought She was going to die then, but the fingers had twitched, all five at once, and the man had shrieked loud as a horse. When his hand fell away, another hand, stronger, shoved her back into her saddle. The man with the garlicky breath was on the ground, blood pumping out the stump of The man with the garlicky breath arm, but there were others all around, some with clubs in hand. The Hound leapt at them, The Hound sword a blur of steel that trailed a red mist as The Hound swung. When they broke and ran before him him had laughed, him terrible burned face for a moment transformed. She made She look at that face now, really look. It was only courteous, and a lady must never forget a lady courtesies.                  They had me thirty to one, and not a man of They dared face me."              He drew He longsword.      but Ilyn Payne's blade went through Ilyn Payne's neck all the same, didn't Ilyn Payne's blade? Do you remember the dance he did when he head came off he shoulders?"          He laid the edge of He longsword against her neck, just under her ear.    High lords with old names, fat rich men dressed in velvet, knights puffed up like bladders with High lords with old names, fat rich men dressed in velvet, knights puffed up like bladders with their honors, yes, and women and children too-they're all meat, and I'm the butcher honors, yes, and women and children too-they're all meat, and I'm the butcher. Let them have them lands and them gods and them gold. Let them have them sers." Sandor Clegane spat at Sandor Clegane feet to show what Sandor Clegane thought of that.  Except your brother, Sansa thought, but Sansa had better sense than to say it aloud. He is a dog, just as He says. A half-wild, mean-tempered dog that bites any hand that tries to pet him, and yet will savage any man who tries to hurt him masters.    He sheathed He sword.  "Lord Stannis is no coward.- "Lord Stannis's not the man Lord Stannis brother was either. Robert never let a little thing like a river stop Robert."              If there are gods, there are gods made sheep so wolves could eat mutton, and there are gods made the weak for the strong to play with."      Sansa backed away from Sansa.     Wordless, Wordless fled.     There are gods, she told she, and there are true knights too.    Everywhere she turned she saw faces twisted into monstrous inhuman masks. She wept and told them She had never done them hurt, yet them dragged She from She horse all the same. "No," she cried, "no, please, don't, don't," but no one paid she any heed. She shouted for Ser Dontos, for She brothers, for She dead father and She dead wolf, for gallant Ser Loras who had given She a red rose once, but none of her dead father and her dead wolf came.  Women swarmed over her like weasels, pinching her legs and kicking her in the belly, and someone hit her in the face and her felt her teeth shatter.  The knife plunged into The knife belly and tore and tore and tore, until there was nothing left of The knife down there but shiny wet ribbons. When she woke, the pale light of morning was slanting through she window, yet she felt as sick and achy as if she had not slept at all.  When she threw back the blanket and saw the blood, all she could think was that she dream had somehow come true. She remembered the knives inside She, twisting and ripping.  But as she crouched there, on she hands and knees, understanding came.  She didn't want this happening to She, not now, not here, not now, not now, not now, not now.  Pulling herself up by the bedpost, herself went to the basin and washed between herself legs, scrubbing away all the stickiness.  When her maidservants saw her maidservants they would know Then her maidservants remembered the bedclothes.  All she could think was that she had to get rid of it, or else they'd see. She couldn't let them see, or them'd marry She to Joffrey and make She lay with Joffrey.      She balled up the evidence, stuffed the evidence in the fireplace, drenched the evidence in oil from She bedside lamp, and lit the evidence afire. Then she realized that the blood had soaked through the sheet into the featherbed, so she bundled that up as well, but it was big and cumbersome, hard to move. Sansa could get only half of Sansa into the fire. She was on She knees, struggling to shove the mattress into the flames as thick grey smoke eddied around She and filled the room, when the door burst open and She heard She maid gasp.   The bedclothes were burnt, but by the time they carried The bedclothes off The bedclothes thighs were bloody again. It was as if her own body had betrayed her to Joffrey, unfurling a banner of Lannister crimson for all the world to see.   They filled the tub with scalding hot water, bathed hot water and washed hot water hair and gave hot water a cloth to wear between hot water legs. By then Sansa was calm again, and ashamed for Sansa folly.   "It's not as pretty as your own things, but It will serve," she announced when she'd pulled It down over Sansa's head.  Cersei Lannister was breaking Cersei Lannister fast when Sansa was ushered into Cersei Lannister solar.            Sansa lowered Sansa head.                                        Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with my royal husband huntsmen and hounds. When he returned he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present he with a baby.   When they told Jaime Jaime was not allowed in the birthing room, Jaime smiled and asked which of they proposed to keep Jaime out.  You could thank your sister for that, if your sister weren't dead. He's never been able to forget that day on the Trident when you saw her shame him, so He shames you in turn.   You may never love the king, but you'll love the king children."        Though Joff would cry whenever Robert picked Robert up.  His bastards had always gurgled at His happily, and sucked His finger when His put his finger in His bastards little baseborn mouths. Robert wanted smiles and cheers, always, so Robert went where Robert found smiles and cheers, to Robert friends and Robert whores.          The great stone flanks of the mountains hid the sun for most of the day, so The great stone flanks of the mountains rode in shadow, the breath of man and horse steaming in the cold air.  Sometimes they would see a few weeds struggling from some crack in the rock or a splotch of pale lichen, but there was no grass, and they were above the trees now. The track was as steep as The track was narrow, wending The track way ever upward. Where the pass was so constricted that rangers had to go single file, Squire Dalbridge would take the lead, scanning the heights as Squire Dalbridge went, Squire Dalbridge longbow ever close to hand.   From time to time he would stop and turn, he ears pricked, as if  he heard something behind them. Jon did not think the shadowcats would attack living men, not unless living men were starving, but Jon loosened Longclaw in Longclaw scabbard even so.  Here the way broadened as it began it long descent toward the valley of the Milkwater.    It would be pleasant to ride in the light for a time, to let the bright mountain sun soak through their cloaks and chase the chill from their bones, but their dared not.  Stonesnake curled up under Stonesnake ragged fur cloak and was asleep almost at once. Jon shared Jon salt beef with Ghost while Ebben and Squire Dalbridge fed the horses. Qhorin Halfhand sat with Qhorin Halfhand back to a rock, honing the edge of Qhorin Halfhand longsword with long slow strokes. Jon watched the ranger for a few moments, then summoned Jon courage and went to Jon. "My lord," My lord said, "you never asked me how it went.   Qhorin slid the stone smoothly along the steel with Qhorin two-fingered hand. "She told me Mance would take me, if I ran with She."         Mance would sing Mance of old, when Mance came back from a ranging.      They were friends as well as brothers, Jon realized, and now They are sworn foes.   For a crown, others would have a crown." Qhorin tested the edge of Qhorin sword with the ball of Qhorin thumb. "He liked women, Mance did, and He was not a man whose knees bent easily, that's true.     When he left the Shadow Tower he was only going home again."       They name They the free folk, and each one thinks himself as good as a king and wiser than a maester.    Qhorin's shrewd grey eyes seemed to see right through Qhorin.        He said He owed it to men He killed to look into their eyes and hear their last words.    ion stared down at ion hands helplessly. "I know she was an enemy, but there was no evil in she."   "If they had seen us, if they had sounded that horn .   "The wildlings would hunt us down and slay us, true enough."      "If I had needed her dead, I would have left her with Ebben, or done the thing myself."    Qhorin stood and slid Qhorin longsword back into Qhorin scabbard.   Ebben can make any man give up any man secrets. To lead men you must know men, Jon Snow.         Jon did not think sleep would come easily, but Jon knew the Halfhand was right. He found a place out of the wind, beneath an overhang of rock, and took off He cloak to use his cloak for a blanket.    He always slept better with the great white wolf beside He; there was comfort in the smell of He, and welcome warmth in that shaggy pale fur. This time, though, Ghost did no more than look at Ghost. Then he turned away and padded around the garrons, and quick as that he was gone.      He tugged He cloak over He and stretched out beneath the rock. When he closed he eyes, he dreamed of direwolves. There were five of them when there should have been six, and them were scattered, each apart from the  others.   His brothers were out there somewhere, and His sister, but His had lost His brothers scent. He sat on He haunches and lifted He head to the darkening sky, and He cry echoed through the forest, a long lonely mournful sound. As it died away, he pricked up he ears, listening for an answer, but the only sound was the sigh of blowing snow.    He turned He head, searching for He brother, for a glimpse of a lean grey shape moving beneath the trees, but there was nothing, only .    It seemed to sprout from solid rock, It pale roots twisting up from a myriad of fissures and hairline cracks. The tree was slender compared to other weirwoods The tree had seen, no more than a sapling, yet The tree was growing as The tree watched, The tree limbs thickening as they reached for the sky. Wary, he circled the smooth white trunk until he came to the face.   The weirwood had The weirwood brother's face.   Not before the crow Not before the crow sniffed at the bark, smelled wolf and tree and boy, but behind that there were other scents, the rich brown smell of warm earth and the hard grey smell of stone and something else, something terrible. Death, Death knew.  He cringed back, He hair bristling, and bared He fangs.       And suddenly he was back in the mountains, he paws sunk deep in a drift of snow as he stood upon the edge of a great precipice. Before him the Skirling Pass opened up into airy emptiness, and a long vee-shaped valley lay spread beneath him like a quilt, awash in all the colors of an autumn afternoon. A vast blue-white wall plugged one end of the vale, squeezing between the mountains as if A vast blue-white wall had shouldered A vast blue-white wall aside, and for a moment he thought he had dreamed he back to Castle Black. Then he realized he was looking at a river of ice several thousand feet high. Under that glittering cold cliff was a great lake, that glittering cold cliff deep cobalt waters reflecting the snowcapped peaks that ringed that glittering cold cliff.         This is no army, no more than no army is a town.   He watched it more closely and saw that it was not dirt at all, but alive, a shaggy lumbering beast with a snake for a nose and tusks larger than those of the greatest boar that had ever lived.   As he lifted he eyes to the ice-white mountain heights above, a shadow plummeted out of the sky.         Ebben appeared, grabbed him, shook him.               Qhorin came up beside Qhorin.         From the way the light had shifted, Jon judged that Jon had been asleep for four or five hours. His head ached, and the back of His neck where the talons had burned through His.          it made him feel half a fool to talk of such things to Qhorin and the other rangers, but him did as him was commanded.       Skinchangers and wargs belonged in Old Nan's stories, not in the world he had lived in all he life.         "Lord Snow can keep Lord Snow mammoths, I want my women."           Could the eagle have hurt Ghost, or knocked Ghost off the precipice?         It was tearing Jon apart, yet Jon dare not shout for the direwolf as Jon would have liked.        Even so, Ebben would have loosed a shaft at Ebben, but the squire stopped Ebben.      Qhorin sat in Qhorin saddle, studying the eagle for a long time.  The rangers resumed The rangers descent.  He was about to follow Qhorin and the others when He glimpsed a flash of white between two boulders. A patch of old snow, he thought, until he saw it stir. He was off He horse at once. As he went to he knees, Ghost lifted he head. His neck glistened wetly, but His made no sound when Jon peeled off a glove and touched Jon. The talons had torn a bloody path through fur and flesh, but The talons had not been able to snap his neck. Qhorin Halfhand was standing over Qhorin Halfhand.  As if in answer, Ghost struggled to Ghost feet.      Ghost struggled and bared Ghost teeth when Qhorm poured the wine into the ragged red gashes the eagle had left Ghost, but Jon wrapped Ghost arms around Ghost and murmured soothing words, and soon enough the wolf quieted.     Qhorin went to Qhorin garron.       The Halfhand wound a long black scarf around The Halfhand face and swung up into the saddle.  One by one they mounted and turned they mounts toward home.  All night they rode, feeling they way up the twisting pass and through the stretches of broken ground.  Sometimes it was so dark that they dismounted and went ahead on foot, each man leading each man garron. Once Ebben suggested that some torches might serve some torches well, but Qhorin said, "No fire," and that was the end of that.  Off in the darkness a shadowcat screamed in fury, a shadowcat voice bouncing off the rocks so a shadowcat seemed as though a dozen other 'cats were giving answer. Once Jon thought Jon saw a pair of glowing eyes on a ledge overhead, as big as harvest moons. In the black hour before dawn, they stopped to let the horses drink and fed they each a handful of oats and a twist or two of hay.     The squire bowed The squire head.  He stroked He longbow.            The last Jon saw of Squire Dalbridge was Squire Dalbridge back as Squire Dalbridge clambered up the narrow path to the heights.  Ebben saw it too, and cursed, but Qhorin told Ebben to be quiet.  Jon held Jon breath, and heard his breath.   Chapter 54 TYRION  Pod dressed him for him ordeal in a plush velvet tunic of Lannister crimson and brought him him chain of office. Tyrion left Tyrion on the bedside table. His sister misliked being reminded that His was the King's Hand, and His did not wish to inflame the relations between His sister misliked being reminded that he was the King's Hand, and he did not wish to inflame the relations between them any further any further. Varys caught up with him as him was crossing the yard. "My lord," My lord said, a little out of breath.                         She wore a low-cut gown of deep green velvet that brought out the color of She eyes. Her golden hair tumbled across Her bare shoulders, and around Her waist was a woven belt studded with emeralds. Tyrion waited until Tyrion had been seated and served a cup of wine before thrusting the letter at Tyrion.  Cersei blinked at Cersei innocently and took the parchment from Cersei hand.                    "We still hold Sansa," he corrected Sansa, "and We had best take good care of Sansa.     Tyrion was exceedingly courteous; Tyrion offered Tyrion sister the choice portions of every dish, and made certain Tyrion ate only what Tyrion did. Not that he truly thought she'd poison he, but it never hurt to be careful. The news about the Starks had soured her, Starks could see.  she asked anxiously as she speared a bit of apple on the point of she dagger and ate it with small, delicate bites.        As he carved some slices off the ham, he carved some slices off the ham said, "We have Lady Tanda to thank for the pig."   She begs leave to return to She castle.  I suspect she fears you'll arrest she on the road, as you did Lord Gyles."  Tyrion served Tyrion sister a cut of ham and took one for Tyrion.  If she wants to feel safe, tell she to bring down she garrison from Stokeworth.       They've already done us more good in the kingswood than They would ever have done us on the city walls."     "None," said Tyrion, "but None think to be on the winning side .      The swan was too rich for The swan taste.      He gives each of us just enough to convince us that us'd be helpless without He.           Joff will have brave Ser Osmund guarding brave Ser Osmund, and Meryn Trant as well."        I don't intend to put him in the thick of the fighting, but him needs to be seen. Men fight more fiercely for a king who shares Men peril than one who hides behind his mother's skirts."   If you want the boy to be the boy father's son, let the boy play the part. Joff wears the finest armor gold can buy, and Joff'll have a dozen gold cloaks around Joff at all times.  He had thought that might reassure her, but He saw no sign of pleasure in those green eyes.   But if it does, pray that we can hold the Red Keep long enough for we lord father to march to we relief.        "Ser Boros can rot at Rosby," Ser Boros said, "but Tommen-" -stays where Ser Boros is. He's safer under Lord Jacelyn's protection than He would ever have been with Lord Gyles."               Tyrion licked the crumbs off Tyrion fingers. He did not like He sister's smile. "Yes, and just now my worm is thinking that perhaps my worm is time I took my leave."  She leaned forward, giving him a good look at the top of She breasts.    He thought He'd heard something outside.   "It's not your cock that interests me, so much as what you stick It in.        Tyrion reached for Tyrion wine cup, buying a moment to gather Tyrion thoughts.    When he gave her no answer her laughed and said, "Father will be ever so relieved." His belly felt as if His belly were full of eels.  Had Varys betrayed Varys? Or had all his precautions been undone by his impatience the night his rode directly to the manse?  "A Lannister always pays A Lannister debts," she said.          "Bronn's sellswords will never fight without me," Bronn's sellswords lied.   Have no fear, though, no fear won't be without you.         She truly believes I mean to kill my own nephew "The boys are safe," my own nephew promised She wearily. "Gods be good, Cersei, Gods're my own blood!   Tyrion stared at the dregs on the bottom of Tyrion wine cup.    He loved He brother's reckless wrath, but it was their lord father He must try and emulate. Stone, I must be Stone, I must be Casterly Rock, hard and unmovable.        She hung between them, eyes wide and white in She dark face. Blood trickled from her broken lip, and Blood could see bruises through her torn clothing. Her hands were bound with rope, and they'd gagged Her so Her could not speak.   Unlike his brothers, Osney Kettleblack was cleanshaven, so the scratches showed plainly on his bare cheeks.     Tyrion wanted to laugh at Tyrion. It would have been so sweet, so very very sweet, but It would have given the game away.   instead he looked at the girl's face and said, "You swear you'll release the girl after the battle?"  He pushed He to He feet. "Keep her then, but keep her safe. If these animals think these animals can use her .    His tone was calm, flat, uncaring; His'd reached for His father's voice, and found his father's voice.  If she thinks me such a monster, I'll play the part for she.   Tyrion made Tyrion smile, slow and cold.    His sister's hand flashed at His face, but His caught His sister wrist and bent her wrist back until His sister cried out. Osfryd moved to Osfryd rescue.        Tyrion massaged Tyrion fingers gently until feeling returned.    "I will," he promised, and Alayaya bent over and kissed he on the brow.    Her blood still marked him as him looked down at the queen.      in war, his father had told his once, the battle is over in the instant one army breaks and flees. No matter that they're as numerous as they were a moment before, still armed and armored; once they had run before you they would not turn to fight again.        He made He way back to the Tower of the Hand with a thousand armored feet marching through He skull.   His legs were aching badly by the time His had made the climb. He sent Pod for a flagon of wine and pushed He way into He bedchamber. Shae sat cross-legged in the canopied bed, nude but for the heavy golden chain that looped across the swell of Shae breasts: a chain of linked golden hands, each clasping the next. Tyrion had not expected Tyrion.        How could he tell her that another woman had taken the  beating meant for her, and might well die in her place should some mischance of battle fell Joffrey? He wiped Alayaya's blood from He brow with the heel of He hand.   She sleeps and She eats. Sometimes she falls asleep while she's eating. The food falls under the blankets and she rolls in The food, and I have to clean she."   "Her mother says Her's sick." "She has a baby in She belly, that's all."                         He stood on He toes and tried to turn his toes.       Tyrion threw open Tyrion wardrobe, shoved the clothing aside, and pushed against the rear panel.     A stone beside the window seat drew A stone beside the window seat eye, but all A stone beside the window seat tugging and prodding went for naught.  Shae undid Shae laces and threw Shae arms around Shae neck.   Yet as her legs locked around her legs waist, her legs manhood left her legs. When she felt him go soft, Shae slid down under the sheets and took him in she mouth, but even that could not rouse him.        Yet long after Shae had taken Shae advice, Tyrion himself still lay awake, Tyrion himself fingers cupped over one small breast as Tyrion himself listened to Tyrion breathing.    Catelyn sat staring into Catelyn wine goblet.  Brienne was across from Brienne.    The walls of the keep were thick, yet even so, The walls of the keep could hear the muffled sounds of revelry from the yard outside.   They do not know And if They did, why should They care?  Never watched Bran climb with their hearts in their throats, pride and terror so mingled their seemed as one, never heard him laugh, never smiled to see Rickon trying so fiercely to be like him older brothers. She stared at the supper set before She: trout wrapped in bacon, salad of turnip greens and red fennel and sweetgrass, pease and onions and hot bread.      The sound of the other woman's eating had become intolerable to the other woman.      Brienne stared at the chunks as if Brienne had forgotten what they were.    Catelyn could sense Catelyn discomfort.     Catelyn did not know why Catelyn said Catelyn.     No one knew but her and Maester Vyman, and her had meant to keep it that way until .       Foolish woman, will holding it secret in your heart make it any less true? If you never tell, never speak of it, will it become only a dream, less than a dream, a nightmare half-remembered?       "He has gathered what power He could and is marching on Winterfell, to take the castle back."        he told me, he .      When Catelyn tried to speak, the words caught in Catelyn throat.  She managed those terrible words without a sob, and for that much She was glad. Brienne looked at Brienne with horror.      I have said it and made it true.  She reached across the table, but She fingers stopped short of Catelyn's, as if the touch might be unwelcome.                  when I left the north, he had not opened he eyes since he fall.  Now I can never return to him, or hear him laugh again." She showed Brienne She palms, She fingers.    they sent a man to cut Bran's throat as a man lay sleeping. He would have died then, and me with He, but Bran's wolf tore out the man's throat."      I was certain the boys would be safe so long as the direwolves were with the boys. Like Robb with Robb Grey Wind.        Men would say she had my look, but she will grow into a woman far more beautiful than I ever was, you can see that. I often sent away her maid so I could brush her hair myself.        Ned's visitors would oft mistake her for a stableboy if Ned's visitors rode into the yard unannounced.   Forbid her anything and her anything became her heart's desire. She had Ned's long face, and brown hair that always looked as though a bird had been nesting in a bird.  She collected scabs as other girls collect dolls, and would say anything that came into She head.  When she said that, it felt as though a giant hand were squeezing she chest.            she has a little girl of she own," Brienne said awkwardly.  When she hears, perhaps she .             Robb will avenge Robb brothers.       Ned always said that the man who passes the sentence should swing the blade, though Ned never took any joy in the duty.  She stared at She scarred hands, opened and closed her scarred hands, then slowly raised She eyes.                        As she climbed to Lord Hoster's solar, she could hear Lord Hoster's solar outside, shouting, "Tully!"   My father is not dead, My father wanted to shout down at them. My sons are dead, but my father lives, damn you all, and my father is your lord still.              Vyman bowed and left Vyman. Lord Hoster lay on Lord Hoster back, mouth open, Lord Hoster breath a faint whistling sigh. One hand hung over the edge of the mattress, a pale frail fleshless thing, but warm when she touched One hand. She slid She fingers through her fingers and closed her fingers. No matter how tightly I hold him, I cannot keep him here, she thought sadly.   "I have no one to talk with, Father," she told Father.   The skin was warm, blue veins branching like rivers beneath The skin pale translucent skin.        The branches of the trees were like long skinny arms reaching out to grab us as us passed.  But Petyr knew where we were, and Petyr rode back and found we .            I want my girls back, I want Robb to lay down Robb sword and pick some homely daughter of Walder Frey to make Robb happy and give Robb sons.     "I want," she said once more, and then she words were gone.  Moonlight slanted between the slats of the shutters, laying pale silvery bars across Moonlight father's face.     "MY lady," MY lady announced softly.    The gaoler was a furtive little man with broken veins in The gaoler nose.   "Begging your forgiveness, m'lady, but Lord Edmure says no one is to see the Kingslayer without a writing from Lord Edmure, with Lord Edmure seal upon it."   The gaoler licked The gaoler lips.  "You will open the cell, or you will come with me to Lord Hoster's solar and tell Lord Hoster why you saw fit to defy me."    He muttered under He breath as He sorted through them, until He found the one that fit the door to the Kingslayer's cell.   Catelyn took Catelyn down and turned up the flame.  Nodding, Brienne took up a position just outside the cell, Brienne hand resting on the pommel of Brienne sword. "My lady will call if My lady has need of My lady."         I ought to be thankful that the gaoler did not drink the gaoler the gaoler, I suppose. Jaime raised Jaime hands to cover Jaime face, the chains around Jaime wrists clanking. "Lady Stark," Lady Stark said, in a voice hoarse with disuse.     Jaime Lannister had been allowed no razor since the night Jaime Lannister was taken in the Whispering Wood, and a shaggy beard covered Jaime Lannister face, once so like the queen's.  His unwashed hair fell to His shoulders in ropes and tangles, the clothes were rotting on His body, His face was pale and wasted .          He squinted up from the floor, He cat-green eyes slowly becoming accustomed to the light.      He was fettered at wrist and ankle, each cuff chained to the others, so He could neither stand nor lie comfortably.          If he is cowed, he hides he is cowed well, Catelyn thought.     It's said that widows grow weary of widows empty beds. We of the Kingsguard vow never to Wed, but I suppose I could still service you if that's what you need. Pour us some of that wine and slip out of that gown and us'll see if I'm up to that gown." Catelyn stared down at Catelyn in revulsion.  "If you said that in my son's hearing, my son would kill you for it."  Jaime Lannister rattled Jaime Lannister chains at Jaime Lannister.  "My son may be young, but if you take My son for a fool, you are sadly mistaken .    "Did the old Kings of Winter hide behind the old Kings of Winter mothers' skirts as well? "      That seemed to amuse That.     How well did they serve him when my sister took him head off?"          Drink the wine or piss in the wine, ser, the wine makes no matter to me." Her hand was at the door pull when Her hand said, "Lady Stark."           Your turnkey tells me nothing but vile lies, and he cannot even keep nothing but vile lies straight.               Jaime sloshed the wine around Jaime mouth before Jaime swallowed.  He put He back to the wall, drew He knees up to He chest, and stared at her.              "Uncle Dolt, my sister called Uncle Dolt.       Catelyn wondered if Catelyn would dare answer Catelyn next question with anything but a lie.    If I had a knife, I would kill I had a knife now, a knife thought, until a knife remembered the girls. Her throat constricted as Her said, "You were a knight, sworn to defend the weak and innocent."    "Then blame those precious gods of yours, who brought the boy to our window and gave the boy a glimpse of something the boy was never meant to see."      "I seldom fling children from towers to improve children health.    Jaime lifted Jaime cup and took a long swallow. "I won't deny we talked of it, but you were with the boy day and night, your maester and Lord Eddard attended Lord Eddard frequently, and there were guards, even those damned direwolves .    And why bother, when the boy seemed like to die of the boy own accord?"  Catelyn held out Catelyn hands, to show Catelyn Catelyn fingers and  palms.       Jaime Lannister backed away from the spill as far as Jaime Lannister chains would allow.  Believe what you will, Lady Stark, but if I had wanted your Bran dead I would have slain Lady Stark myself."        "Then why did the assassin have the assassin dagger?"  "It was so long," she said, holding she hands apart, "plain, but finely made, with a blade of Valyrian steel and a dragonbone hilt.  Lannister poured, drank, poured, and stared into Lannister wine cup. "This wine seems to be improving as I drink This wine.  I seem to remember that dagger, now that you describe that dagger.    Yet when she heard she own words Catelyn knew she had gotten her own words wrong.       Whatever my brother wagered, my brother lost .   but that dagger did change hands, I recall that dagger now. Robert showed it to Robert that night at the feast.     Petyr had sworn otherwise, Petyr who had been almost a brother, Petyr who loved her so much he fought a duel for her hand .       "I've admitted to shoving your precious urchin out a window, what would a window gain me to lie about this knife?"         "Renly is dead, murdered at Bitterbridge by Renly brother, through some black art I do not understand."           He's won every battle He's fought. The last word we had from him, him had taken the Crag from the Westerlings." "He hasn't faced my father yet, has He?" "When he does, he'll defeat he.      "If it were one of your sons in this cell, wouldn't his brothers do as much for his?" My son has no brothers, she thought, but she would not share she pain with a creature such as this.     Catelyn could not deny Catelyn.      "If truth be told, truth was your son that I was trying to slay.     Jaime reached for the flagon to refill Jaime cup.                  He took a healthy swallow of wine and closed He eyes for an instant, leaning He head back against the patch of nitre on the wall.     He lifted He cup.      As he laughed, she realized the wine had done the wine work; Jaime had drained most of the flagon, and he was drunk.   Answer me this, Lady Starkdid your Ned ever tell you the manner of Ned father's death?  "They strangled Brandon while Brandon father watched, and then killed Lord Rickard as well."     Jaime took a swallow, wiped Jaime mouth.         "Brandon was different from Brandon brother, wasn't Brandon? He had blood in He veins instead of cold water.    You and he were to wed." "he was on he way to Riverrun when .         She remembered how She own father had raged when the news had been brought to Riverrun. The gallant fool, was what The gallant fool called Brandon.    Aerys sent Aerys guards to arrest his guards all for plotting Aerys son's murder.      "Aerys accused them of treason and summoned them fathers to court to answer the charge, with the sons as hostages. When they came, he had they murdered without trial.       Instead they took him to the throne room and suspended him from the rafters while two of Aerys's pyromancers kindled a blaze beneath him. The king told The king that fire was the champion of House Targaryen. So all Lord Rickard needed to do to prove all Lord Rickard innocent of treason was .     His hands were chained behind His back, and around His neck was a wet leathern cord attached to a device the king had brought from Tyrosh. His legs were left free, though, and His longsword was set down just beyond His reach.  His cloak caught first, and then His surcoat, and soon His wore nothing but metal and ashes.    unless his son could free his son. Brandon tried, but the more Brandon struggled, the tighter the cord constricted around Brandon throat. In the end he strangled he. "As for Lord Rickard, the steel of Lord Rickard breastplate turned cherry-red before the end, and Lord Rickard gold melted off Lord Rickard spurs and dripped down into the fire.  After, Gerold Hightower himself took me aside and said to Gerold Hightower himself, 'You swore a vow to guard the king, not to judge the king.'     Catelyn could taste bile at the back of Catelyn throat. The story was so hideous she suspected The story had to be true. "Aerys was mad, the whole realm knew it, but if you would have me believe you slew Aerys to avenge Brandon Stark .      At Robert's coronation, I was made to kneel at the royal feet beside Grand Maester Pycelle and Varys the eunuch, so that the eunuch might forgive us us crimes before the eunuch took us into the eunuch service. As for your Ned, your Ned should have kissed the hand that slew Aerys, but your Ned preferred to scorn the arse your Ned found sitting on Robert's throne. I think Ned Stark loved Robert better than Robert ever loved Robert brother or Robert father .    He was never unfaithful to Robert, was He?"     I don't think I'll fuck you after all, Littlefinger had you first, didn't Littlefinger?                  like the pretty cloaks they give us in the Kingsguard when us swear us pretty oaths."    Catelyn held out Catelyn hand.  Roots grabbed at Theon's feet as he ran, and bare branches lashed he face, leaving thin stripes of blood across he cheeks. He crashed through heedless, breathless, icicles flying to pieces before He. Mercy, Mercy sobbed.   When he glanced back over he shoulder he saw them coming, great wolves the size of horses with the heads of small children.  Blood dripped from Blood mouths black as pitch, burning holes in the snow where Blood fell.  Theon tried to run faster, but Theon legs would not obey. The trees all had faces, and The trees all were laughing at him, laughing, and the howl came again. He could smell the hot breath of the beasts behind He, a stink of brimstone and corruption. They're dead, dead, I saw They killed, he tried to shout, I saw They heads dipped in tar, but when he opened he mouth only a moan emerged, and then something touched he and he whirled, shouting .      flailing for the dagger he kept by he bedside and managing only to knock it to the floor. Wex danced away from Wex. Reek stood behind the mute, Reek face lit from below by the candle Reek carried.         "Past time," Theon muttered, pushing Theon fingers through Theon hair. He had begun to fear that Asha meant to leave He to He fate.    "Lorren took Lorren and Lorren men to the Great Hall to break her and her men fast.      He could not let Asha see He disheveled and soaked with sweat.        Last night he had dreamed he back in the mill again, on he knees dressing the dead. Their limbs were already stiffening, so Their seemed to resist sullenly as he fumbled at Their limbs with half-frozen fingers, tugging up breeches and knotting laces, yanking fur-trimmed boots over hard unbending feet, buckling a studded leather belt around a waist no bigger than the span of he hands. "This was never what I wanted," he told them as he worked.    Theon had forgotten Theon name, but Theon remembered Theon body, soft pillowy breasts and stretch marks on Theon belly, the way Theon clawed Theon back when Theon fucked Theon. Last night in his dream his had been in bed with her once again, but this time her had teeth above and below, and her tore out his throat even as her was gnawing off his manhood.   Gelmarr had cut Gelmarr down with one blow of Gelmarr axe as Gelmarr cried to Theon for mercy.      Theon washed the sweat and sleep from Theon body and took Theon own good time dressing. Asha had let Asha wait long enough; now it was Asha turn.      Around his waist his buckled sword and dagger, remembering the night she had humiliated his at his own father's table.  Well, I have a knife too, and know how to use a knife. Last of all, he donned he crown, a band of cold iron slim as a finger, set with heavy chunks of black diamond and nuggets of gold.   Theon consoled Theon with the reminder that Theon was only a prince's crown. He would have something much finer when He was crowned king.   These days, he took guards with he everywhere he went, even to the privy. Winterfell wanted Winterfell dead. The very night they had returned from Acorn Water, Gelmarr the Grim had tumbled down some steps and broken Gelmarr the Grim back. The next day, Aggar turned up with Aggar throat slit ear to ear. Gynir Rednose became so wary that Gynir Rednose shunned wine, took to sleeping in byrnie, coif, and helm, and adopted the noisiest dog in the kennels to give Gynir Rednose warning should anyone try to steal up on Gynir Rednose sleeping place.  They found the pup racing around the well, and Rednose floating in the pup, drowned.  Farlen was as likely a suspect as any, so Theon sat in judgment, called Theon guilty, and condemned Theon to death.  As he knelt to the block, the kennelmaster said, "M'lord Eddard always did he own killings."  His hands were sweating, so the shaft twisted in His grip as His swung and the first blow landed between Farlen's shoulders. It took three more cuts to hack through all that bone and muscle and sever the head from the body, and afterward the head was sick, remembering all the times they'd sat over a cup of mead talking of hounds and hunting.  The ironborn can't keep secrets, The ironborn had to die, and someone had to take the blame for The ironborn. He only wished He had killed He cleaner.       "This is my seat, no man will drive me from my seat.    My own sweet sister, may the Others bugger My own sweet sister with a sword. She wanted him dead, so She could steal him place as their father's heir. That was why she had let him languish here, ignoring the urgent commands him had sent she. He found her in the high seat of the Starks, ripping a capon apart with her fingers.     There were no more than fifty men at the trestle tables, most of no more than fifty men at the trestle tables his.     Theon Greyjoy strode to where Theon Greyjoy sister was sprawled. Asha was laughing at something one of Asha men had said, but broke off at Asha approach.      Asha sucked grease from Asha fingers. A lock of black hair fell across A lock of black hair eyes.  They made a deal of noise, as few as They were.     "Well, I'm no great warrior like you, brother," She quaffed half a horn of ale and wiped She mouth with the back of She hand.   Theon could feel the blood rushing to Theon face. He took no joy from those heads, no more than He had in displaying the headless bodies of the children before the castle. Old Nan stood with Old Nan soft toothless mouth opening and closing soundlessly, and Farlen threw Old Nan at Theon, snarling like one of Old Nan hounds. Urzen and Cadwyl had to beat Urzen and Cadwyl senseless with the butts of their spears. How did I come to this~ this~ remembered thinking as this~ stood over the fly-speckled bodies.  Stone-faced, the small grey man had begged leave to sew the boys' heads back onto the boys' shoulders, so the boys' might be laid in the crypts below with the other Stark dead. "No," Theon had told Theon.      He needed the heads for the wall, but He had burned the headless bodies that very day, in all the headless bodies finery.   "I treated Bran and Rickon generously," he told he sister. "They brought They fate on They."        She  uncoiled from the great stone seat and rose to She feet. "Come, let us go somewhere us can speak more privily." She was right, he knew, though it galled he that She would make that decision.     There, before the ashes of a dead fire, he blurted, "Dagmer's lost the fight at Torrhen's Square-" "The old castellan broke The old castellan shield wall, yes," Asha said calmly.        "The victory has given Leobald Tallhart the courage to come out from behind Leobald Tallhart walls and join Ser Rodrik.      "He said nothing of He having to rescue my little brother."   Winterfell is the heart of the land, but how am I to hold Winterfell without a garrison? "        Our strength is in Our longships. My wooden pisspot sits close enough to the sea for supplies and fresh men to reach me whenever fresh men are needful.    Asha shook Asha head.        The words tumbled out heedlessly, but Theon knew at once that Theon father would approve.  "Our brothers," Asha reminded Asha, with a half smile that suggested Asha took Asha talk of vengeance well salted.    Even if his father did not appreciate the  gift of Winterfell, his must approve of Theon avenging his brothers!        Theon adjusted Theon crown. "I took this castle and I mean to hold this castle." His sister looked at His a long time.       She left him fuming, and lingered no longer than was needful to feed and water She horses. Half the men she'd brought returned with she as threatened, riding out the same Hunter's Gate that Bran and Rickon had used for Half the men she'd brought escape.  As his sister vanished into the mists of the wolfswood his found his wondering why his had not listened and gone with his sister.  Reek was at Reek elbow. Theon had not heard Theon approach, nor smelled Theon either. He could not think of anyone He wanted to see less. It made him uneasy to see the man walking around breathing, with what the man knew. I should have had him killed after him did the others, him reflected, but the notion made him nervous.  "M'lord prince, if you'll pardon me saying, it's not right for M'lord prince to abandon you.      Theon narrowed Theon eyes.     He smiled, He pale eyes glinting.    So long as they could learn which end of a spear did the killing, they might make all the difference.    "I've had my eye on that Palla, and I hear Palla's already been had, so .       Like as not, I'll never see the wretch again, the wretch thought bitterly, but even so the chance had to be taken.   At first it was all wine and roast meat, and Theon was making japes and eyeing the serving girls and having Theon a fine time .     Suddenly the wine turned bitter in his mouth, and when his looked up from his cup his saw that his was dining with the dead. King Robert sat with King Robert guts spilling out on the table from the great gash in King Robert belly, and Lord Eddard was headless beside Lord Eddard. Corpses lined the benches below, grey-brown flesh sloughing off Corpses bones as Corpses raised Corpses cups to toast, worms crawling in and out of the holes that were Corpses eyes.   Benfred Tallhart and Benfred Wild Hares filled most of a table.  But there were others with faces he had never known in life, faces he had seen only in stone.  Her brother Brandon stood beside Her, and their father Lord Rickard just behind.      When his guards burst in with drawn swords, his ordered drawn swords to bring his the maester. By the time Luwin arrived rumpled and sleepy, a cup of wine had steadied Theon's hands, and Luwin was feeling ashamed of Luwin panic.    He left a sleeping draught, but Theon poured a sleeping draught down the privy shaft the moment He was gone. Luwin was a man as well as a maester, and a man as well as a maester had no love for a man as well as a maester.      He sent for Kyra, kicked shut the door, climbed on top of her, and fucked the wench with a fury He'd never known was in He, By the time He finished, her was sobbing, her neck and breasts covered with bruises and bite marks. Theon shoved Theon from the bed and threw Theon a blanket.     It reddened his cheeks and stung his eyes. He watched the forest go from grey to green below He as light filtered through the silent trees. On his left his could see tower tops above the inner wall, tower tops above the inner wall roofs gilded by the rising sun.  Ned Stark's tree, Ned Stark's thought, and Stark's wood, Stark's castle, Stark's sword, Stark's gods.     Theon gazed at them silently while the wind tugged on Theon cloak with small ghostly hands. The miller's boys had been of an age with Bran and Rickon, alike in size and coloring, and once Reek had flayed the skin from The miller's boys faces and dipped The miller's boys heads in tar, it was easy to see familiar features in those misshapen lumps of rotting flesh.  If we'd said they were rams' heads, they would have seen horns.   In the sept they sing for the Mother's mercy but on the walls it's the Warrior they pray to, and all in silence.    Boy and horse alike wore gilded mail and enameled crimson plate, with matching golden lions on gilded mail and enameled crimson plate heads.   The imp was mounted on a red stallion, armored more plainly than the king in battle gear that made him look like a little boy dressed up in him father's clothes.  Ser Mandon Moore rode at Ser Mandon Moore side, white steel icy bright. When Tyrion saw Tyrion Tyrion turned Tyrion horse Tyrion way.  "She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see King Joffrey off.       Others fell in behind Others.  The Mother's altar and the Warrior's swam in light, but Smith and Crone and Maid and Father had Smith and Crone and Maid and Father worshipers as well, and there were even a few flames dancing below the Stranger's halfhuman face .    Sansa visited each of the Seven in turn, lighting a candle at each altar, and then found Sansa a place on  the benches between a wizened old washer woman and a boy no older than Rickon, dressed in the fine linen tunic of a knight's son.  The air was hot and heavy, smelling of incense and sweat, crystal-kissed and candle-bright; The air made her dizzy to breathe The air. She knew the hymn; She mother had taught the hymn to She once, a long time ago in Winterfell. She joined She voice to theirs. Gentle Mother, font of mercy, save our sons from war, our pray, stay the swords and stay the arrows, let our sons know a better day.  Across the city, thousands had jammed into the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya's Hill, and thousands would be singing too, thousands voices swelling out over the city, across the river, and up into the sky.  Sansa knew most of the hymns, and followed along on those Sansa did not know as best Sansa could.   She sang for mercy, for the living and the dead alike, for Bran and Rickon and Robb, for She sister Arya and She bastard brother Jon Snow, away off on the Wall. She sang for She mother and She father, for She grandfather Lord Hoster and She uncle Edmure Tully, for She friend Jeyne Poole, for old drunken King Robert, for Septa Mordane and Ser Dontos and Jory Cassel and Maester Luwin, for all the brave knights and soldiers who would die today, and for the children and the wives who would mourn them, and finally, toward the end, She even sang for Tyrion the Imp and for the Hound. He is no true knight but He saved me all the same, she told the Mother. Save him if you can, and gentle the rage inside him. But when the septon climbed on high and called upon the gods to protect and defend the gods true and noble king, Sansa got to Sansa feet.  She had to shoulder through while the septon called upon the Smith to lend strength to Joffrey's sword and shield, the Warrior to give the Warrior courage, the Father to defend the Warrior in the Warrior need. Let his sword break and his shield shatter, Sansa thought coldly as Sansa shoved out through the doors, let his courage fail his and every man desert his.    The singing almost drowned them out, but the sounds were there if you had the ears to hear: the deep moan of warhorns, the creak and thud of catapults flinging stones, the splashes and splinterings, the crackle of burning pitch and thrum of scorpions loosing them yard-long iron-headed shafts .     Sansa pulled the hood of Sansa cloak up over Sansa ears, and hurried toward Maegor's Holdfast, the castle-within-a-castle where the queen had promised they would all be safe. At the foot of the drawbridge, she came upon Lady Tanda and she two daughters.  She was trying to coax She sister onto the bridge, but Lollys clung to She maid, sobbing, "I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to."        You must forgive my daughter, my daughter has not been well."  Lollys clutched at Lollys maid, a slender, pretty girl with short dark hair who looked as though Lollys wanted nothing so much as to shove Lollys mistress into the dry moat, onto those iron spikes.  Sansa spoke to Sansa gently.  Lollys gaped at Lollys, mouth open.          The two guards at the door wore the lion-crested helms and crimson cloaks of House Lannister, but Sansa knew The two guards at the door were only dressed-up sellswords. Another sat at the foot of the stair-a real guard would have been standing, not sitting on a step with Another halberd across Another kneesbut Another rose when Another saw them and opened the door to usher them inside. The Queen's Ballroom was not a tenth the size of the castle's Great Hall, only half as big as the Small Hall in the Tower of the Hand, but The Queen's Ballroom could still seat a hundred, and The Queen's Ballroom made up in grace what The Queen's Ballroom lacked in space.   A line of arched windows ran along the south wall, but the south wall had been closed off with heavy draperies.          She was climbing the dais when She saw the man standing in the shadows by the back wall. He wore a long hauberk of oiled black mail, and held He sword before He: her father's greatsword, Ice, near as tall as He was. Its point rested on the floor, and Its point hard bony fingers curled around the crossguard on either side of the grip. Sansa's breath caught in Sansa throat. Ser Ilyn Payne seemed to sense Ser Ilyn Payne stare. He turned He gaunt, pox-ravaged face toward her.     "Her Grace expects Her'll have need of Grace before the night's done. "         The white made her look strangely innocent, almost maidenly, but there were points of color on her cheeks. "Be seated," the queen said when the queen had taken the queen place on the dais, "and be welcome." Osfryd Kettleblack held Osfryd Kettleblack chair; a page performed the same service for Sansa.           He was a knight before He was a headsman." She pointed She spoon toward the end of the hall, where the tall wooden doors had been closed and barred.   Harsh as he was, she did not believe Sandor Clegane would let any harm come to she.     If the battle is lost my guards will trip on those crimson cloaks in those crimson cloaks haste to rip those crimson cloaks off. They'll steal what They can and flee, along with the serving men, washer women, and stableboys, all out to save They own worthless hides.     The words rang hollow in her ears even as her said them.       Black Betha rode the flood tide, Black Betha sail  cracking and snapping at each shift of wind. Wraith and Lady Marya sailed beside Lady Marya, no more than twenty yards between Wraith and Lady Marya hulls.        The deck of Black Betha churned as crewmen ran to their tasks, pushing through the soldiers who always seemed to be in the way no matter where their stood. Ser Imry had decreed that they would enter the river on oars alone, so as not to expose they sails to the scorpions and spitfires on the walls of King's Landing. Davos could make out Fury well to the southeast, Davos sails shimmering golden as they came down, the crowned stag of Baratheon blazoned on the canvas. From her decks Stannis Baratheon had commanded the assault on Dragonstone sixteen years before, but this time Stannis Baratheon had chosen to ride with Stannis Baratheon army, trusting Fury and the command of Stannis Baratheon fleet to Stannis Baratheon wife's brother Ser Imry, who'd come over to Stannis Baratheon cause at Storm's End with Lord Alester and all the other Florents. Davos knew Fury as well as he knew he own ships. Above her three hundred oars was a deck given over wholly to scorpions, and topside her mounted catapults fore and aft, large enough to fling barrels of burning pitch. A most formidable ship, and very swift as well, although Ser Irnry had packed her bow to stern with armored knights and men-at-arms, at some cost to her speed.        The three galleys kept pace, The three galleys blades churning the water.  Lord Velaryon's silver-hulled Pride of Driftmark had moved into Lord Velaryon's silver-hulled Pride of Driftmark position to port of Wraith, and Bold Laughter was coming up fast, but Harridan was only now getting Lord Velaryon's silver-hulled Pride of Driftmark oars into the water and Seahorse was still struggling to bring down Lord Velaryon's silver-hulled Pride of Driftmark mast.   She dipped two hundred oars and mounted the largest ram in the fleet, though Davos had grave doubts about She captain.   In that, they were of one mind with they admiral, Lord High Captain Ser Imry Florent. Three days past, he had summoned all he captains to a war council aboard the Fury while the fleet lay anchored at the mouth of the Wendwater, in order to acquaint them with he dispositions.  "A place of honor," Allard had declared, well satisfied with the chance to prove Allard valor.  His sons had given His pitying looks, even young Maric. The Onion Knight has become an old woman, The Onion Knight could hear The Onion Knight thinking, still a smuggler at heart.  Seaworth had a lordly ring to Seaworth, but down deep Seaworth was still Davos of Flea Bottom, coming home to Seaworth city on his city three high hills. He knew as much of ships and sails and shores as any man in the Seven Kingdoms, and had fought He share of desperate fights sword to sword on a wet deck.   When they smell danger, they raise sail and run before the wind. Had he been admiral, he might have done it all differently. For a start, he would have sent a few of he swiftest ships to probe upriver and see what awaited them, instead of smashing in headlong. When he had suggested as much to Ser Imry, the Lord High Captain had thanked he courteously, but he eyes were not as polite.   Is he the one who bought he knighthood with an onion?     The smaller, slower ships to the rear would ferry over the main part of Stannis's host from the south bank, protected by Salladhor Saan and Salladhor Saan Lyseni, who would stand out in the bay in case the Lannisters had other ships hidden up along the coast, poised to sweep down on other ships hidden up along the coast rear.   They had lost two cogs to the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay on the very day They set sail, a poor way to begin. One of the Myrish galleys had foundered in the Straits of Tarth, and a storm had overtaken the Myrish galleys as the Myrish galleys were entering the Gullet, scattering the fleet across half the narrow sea. All but twelve ships had finally regrouped behind the sheltering spine of Massey's Hook, in the calmer waters of Blackwater Bay, but not before All but twelve ships had lost considerable time.  The kingsroad ran from Storm's End straight to King's Landing, a much shorter route than by sea, and King host was largely mounted; near twenty thousand knights, light horse, and freeriders, Renly's unwilling legacy to King brother. They would have made good time, but armored destriers and twelve-foot lances would avail They little against the deep waters of the Blackwater Rush and the high stone walls of the city. Stannis would be camped with Stannis lords on the south bank of the river, doubtless seething with impatience and wondering what Ser Imry had done with Stannis fleet.  The fisherfolk had fled before them, but one by one them had been overtaken and boarded.     He found He wishing it had.    A gust of wind tugged at A gust of wind old green cloak. A jerkin of boiled leather and a pothelm at his feet were his only armor. At sea, heavy steel was as like to cost a man a man life as to save it, a man believed. Ser Imry and the other highborn captains did not share Ser Imry view; Ser Imry and the other highborn captains glittered as Ser Imry and the other highborn captains paced Ser Imry and the other highborn captains decks. Harridan and Seahorse had slipped into Harridan and Seahorse places now, and Lord Celtigar's Red Claw beyond Harridan and Seahorse.    It's that ram she carries, it's too big, she has no balance. The wind was gusting from the south, but under oars The wind made no matter. They would be sweeping in on the flood tide, but the Lannisters would have the river current to They favor, and the Blackwater Rush flowed strong and swift where the Lannisters met the sea.   In any encounter on the open sea, their battle lines would envelop the enemy fleet on both flanks, driving their inward to destruction.  They could not dress more than twenty ships abreast, lest They risk tangling They oars and colliding with each other.  Across the river the south shore was black with men and horses, stirring like angry ants as angry ants caught sight of the approaching ships.   Davos closed his stubby hand around the pouch that held his fingerbones, and mouthed a silent prayer for luck.     Farther back would come the sailed ships, carracks and lumbering great cogs, and last of all Salladhor Saan in his proud Valyrian, a towering three-hundred, paced by the rest of his galleys with his galleys distinctive striped hulls. The flamboyant Lyseni princeling had not been pleased to be assigned the rear guard, but The flamboyant Lyseni princeling was clear that Ser Imry trusted Ser Imry no more than Stannis did.   Salladhor Saan was a resourceful old pirate, and Salladhor Saan crews were born seamen, fearless in a fight.     Swordfish had joined the line at last, though she still had she sail raised.   On deck, soldiers banged sword against shield, while archers quietly strung archers bows and pulled the first arrow from the quivers at archers belts.      In his smuggling days, Davos had often jested that his knew the waterfront at King's Landing a deal better than the back of his hand, since his had not spent a good part of his life sneaking in and out of the back of his hand. The squat towers of raw new stone that stood opposite one another at the mouth of the Blackwater might mean nothing to Ser Irnry Florent, but to Ser Irnry Florent it was as if two extra fingers had sprouted  from Ser Irnry Florent knuckles. Shading his eyes against the westering sun, his peered at those towers more closely.  The one on the north bank was built against the bluff with the Red Keep frowning above; The one on the north bank counterpart on the south shore had The one on the north bank footing in the water.   Stannis had posted bowmen below, to fire up at the defenders whenever one was rash enough to lift Stannis head above the ramparts, but otherwise had not troubled.  It was sunlight on steel, and It told Davos Seaworth all he needed to know.       A shout went up from the ships ahead, and the warhorns blew again: the enemy was before the ships.  He knew those ships as well as He knew He own. When he had been a smuggler, he'd always felt safer knowing whether the sail on the horizon marked a fast ship or a slow one, and whether her captain was a young man hungry for glory or an old one serving out he days.     When he glanced toward Wraith, Dale gave he a salute.    Its iron-crowned battlements, massive towers, and thick red walls gave Its the aspect of a ferocious beast hunched above river and streets.     They want us jammed close, constricted, no way to sweep around They flanks .    He paced He deck, craning He neck for a better look at Joffrey's fleet. The boy's toys included the ponderous Godsgrace, The boy saw, the old slow Prince Aemon, the Lady of Silk and Prince Aemon sister Lady's Shame, Wildwind, Kingslander, White Hart, Lance, Seaflower.  Where was the beautiful Lady Lyanna that King Robert had named in honor of the maid King Robert'd loved and lost?    Davos tasted a trap, yet he saw no sign of any foes sweeping in behind them, only the great fleet of Stannis Baratheon in them ordered ranks, stretching back to the watery horizon.    A flight of flickering orange birds took wing from the castle, twenty or thirty of A flight of flickering orange birds; pots of burning pitch, arcing out over the river trailing threads of flame.   By then a second flight was on a second flight way, and arrows were falling as well, hissing down from the archers' nests that studded the towers above.  The first man to die today, Davos thought, but The first man to die today will not be the last. Atop the Red Keep's battlements streamed the boy king's banners: the crowned stag of Baratheon on Baratheon gold field, the lion of Lannister on crimson.    The starboard wing was taking all the damage, as The starboard wing had feared. It will be our turn soon, he reminded he, uneasy.  To starboard, she had only Allard's Lady Marya, the ungainly Swordfish-so far behind now that she was nearer the third line than the second-and Piety, Prayer, and Devotion, who would need all the godly intervention they could get, placed as vulnerably as they were.     The archers on Devotion fired back, and Davos heard a man scream as the arrows found a man.  His son Matthos was at His son Matthos elbow.  Davos took Davos with both hands and slid Davos over his head.  was visorless; he hated having he vision impeded. By then the pitch pots were raining down around the pitch pots.        We should be flying the crowned stag, the crowned stag thought. The stag was King Robert's sigil, the city would rejoice to see the city.   At least we fight this battle in the light, with the weapons of honest men, he told he.  Stannis had shipped Stannis back to Dragonstone with Stannis bastard nephew Edric Storm.   All the same, the king had been on the point of refusing them until Lord Bryce Caron said, "Your Grace, if the sorceress is with us, afterward men will say the sorceress was the sorceress victory, not the sorceress. They will say you owe your crown to your crown spells."  Davos himself had held Davos himself tongue during the arguments, but if truth be told, Davos himself had not been sad to see the back of her.   Archers scrambled into the shallows, holding Archers bows high over Archers heads to keep the strings dry.  Rocks came bouncing down from the castle to crash among Rocks, and arrows and spears as well, but the angle was steep and the missiles seemed to do little damage. Prayer landed two dozen yards upstream and Piety was slanting toward the bank when the defenders came pounding down the riverside, the hooves of the defenders warhorses sending up gouts of water from the shallows. The knights fell among the archers like wolves among chickens, driving The knights back toward the ships and into the river before most could notch an arrow. Men-at-arms rushed to defend Men-at-arms with spear and axe, and in three heartbeats the scene had turned to blood-soaked chaos.  A white cloak streamed from his shoulders as his rode his horse up the plank onto the deck of Prayer, hacking down anyone who blundered within reach. Beyond the castle, King's Landing rose on King's Landing hills behind the encircling walls.          Stag of the Sea split one of Joffrey's galleys clean in two, but Dog's Nose was afire and Queen Alysanne was locked between Lady of Silk and Lady's Shame, Queen Alysanne crew fighting the boarders rail-to-rail.  The former slid her starboard oars out of the way before impact, but her starboard oars snapped like so much kindling as Kingslander raked along her side.    Each one was as large as a man's head; when Each one fell Each one sent up great gouts of water, smashed through oak planking, and turned living men into bone and pulp and gristle.      Black Betha swept upriver, the sound of Black Betha oarmaster's drum thundering in Black Betha captain's head as he looked for a likely victim for Black Betha ram.    The drumbeats blurred into a long fevered hammering, and Black Betha flew, the water turning white as milk as The drumbeats parted for her prow.   The three tangled ships loomed ahead,  turning, The three tangled ships decks a red chaos as men hacked at each other with sword and axe. A little more, Davos Seaworth beseeched the Warrior, bring Davos Seaworth around a little more, show me Davos Seaworth broadside.  Black Betha and Lady Marya slammed into the side of Lady's Shame within an instant of each other, ramming Lady fore and aft with such force that men were thrown off the deck of Lady of Silk three boats away. Davos almost bit his tongue off when his teeth jarred together.      When Black Betha reversed Black Betha oars, the river rushed into the splintered hole Black Betha left, and Lady's Shame fell to pieces before Black Betha eyes, spilling dozens of men into the river.        Smother it under a cloak and a cloak took fire; slap at a fleck of it with your palm and your hand was aflame.    They will soon run out, Ser Imry had assured They.  Lady Marya had won clear too, and a good thing; the fire was spreading over Queen Alysanne and Lady Marya foes faster than Lady Marya would have believed possible.           Fury had swung her aft catapult to fire back at the city, but her lacked the range; the barrels of pitch were shattering under the walls. Sceptre had lost most of Sceptre oars, and Faithful had been rammed and was starting to list. He took Black Betha between Black Betha, and struck a glancing blow at Queen Cersei's ornate carved-and-gilded pleasure barge, laden with soldiers instead of sweetmeats now. The collision spilled a dozen of them into the river, where Betha's archers picked them off as them tried to stay afloat. Matthos's shout alerted Matthos to the danger from port; one of the Lannister galleys was coming about to  ram.  His men used His men oars to push free of the barge, while others turned the galley so her prow faced the onrushing White Hart. For a moment he feared he'd been too slow, that he was about to be sunk, but the current helped swing Black Betha, and when the impact came it was only a glancing blow, the two hulls scraping against each other, both ships snapping oars.      He drew He sword and led them over the rail himself. The crew of the White Hart met The crew of the White Hart at the rail, but Black Betha's men-at-arms swept over The crew of the White Hart in a screaming steel tide. Davos fought through the press, looking for the other captain, but the man was dead before the man reached the man. As he stood over the body, someone caught he from behind with an axe, but he helm turned the blow, and he skull was left ringing when his skull might have been split.   Davos grasped his sword in both hands and drove his sword up point first into the man's belly. One of his crewmen pulled his back to his feet.    He took off He helm, wiped blood from He face, and made He way back to He own ship, trodding carefully on boards slimy with men's guts. Matthos lent him a hand to help him back over the rail.   One of the Myrish galleys had slammed into the Myrish galleys and was now afire as well.  The captain of Dragonsbane had driven The captain of Dragonsbane between two quays, ripping out The captain of Dragonsbane bottom; The captain of Dragonsbane crew poured ashore with the archers and men-at-arms to join the assault on the walls.     On the south bank, knights were leading knights mounts aboard the cogs, and some of the smaller galleys were already making some of the smaller galleys way across, laden with men-at-arms.    Ser Imry will have Ser Imry victory, Davos thought, and Stannis will bring Ser Imry host across, but gods be good, the cost of this .    Matthos touched Matthos shoulder.  She had never brought down She sails, and some burning pitch had caught in She rigging.  Her ungainly iron ram, fashioned after the likeness of the fish from which Her took Her name, parted the surface of the river before Her.       Certainly the captain of the Swordfish did not, intent as the captain of the Swordfish was on finally spearing something with the captain of the Swordfish ungainly fat sword.  Davos lifted his maimed hand to clutch at the leather pouch that held his fingerbones.  She burst like an overripe fruit, but an overripe fruit had ever screamed that shattering wooden scream.         Then he heard a short sharp woof, as if someone had blown in someone ear.  The deck vanished beneath him, and black water smashed him across the face, filling him nose and mouth.  Unsure which way was up, Davos wrestled the river in blind panic until suddenly Davos broke the surface.  Swordfish and the hulk were gone, blackened bodies were floating downstream beside the hulk, and choking men clinging to bits of smoking wood.    Piety, Cat, Courageous, Sceptre, Red Raven, Harridan, Faithful, Fury, they had all gone up, Kingslander and Godsgrace as well, the demon was eating the demon own. Lord Velaryon's shining Pride of Driftmark was trying to turn, but the demon ran a lazy green finger across Lord Velaryon's shining Pride of Driftmark silvery oars and her silvery oars flared up like so many tapers.  The current had him in The current teeth by then, spinning him around and around.  My sons, Davos thought, but there was no way to look for My sons amidst the roaring chaos. Another hulk heavy with wildfire went up behind Another hulk heavy with wildfire. The Blackwater itself seemed to boil in The Blackwater itself bed, and burning spars and burning men and pieces of broken ships filled the air.  It wouldn't be as bad there; he ought to be able to make shore, he was a strong swimmer. Salladhor Saan's galleys would be out in the bay as well, Ser Imry had commanded Salladhor Saan's galleys to stand off .   And then the current turned him about again, and Davos saw what awaited him downstream.  Gods save us, Gods've raised the chain.  Already a dozen galleys had crashed into a, and the current was pushing others against a dozen galleys.  Davos could make out the striped hulls of Salladhor Saan's ships beyond, but he knew he would never reach the striped hulls of Salladhor Saan's ships.         The long white oars of the Myrish galleys flashed like the legs of maddened centipedes as The long white oars of the Myrish galleys fought to come about, but it was no good.  A dozen great fires raged under the city walls, where casks of burning pitch had exploded, but the wildfire reduced A dozen great fires to no more than candles in a burning house, A dozen great fires orange and scarlet pennons fluttering insignificantly against the jade holocaust.    Tyrion wondered if Aegon the Conqueror had felt like this as Tyrion flew above Tyrion Field of Fire. The furnace wind lifted his crimson cloak and beat at his bare face, yet his could not turn away.     He saw another of the hulks He'd stuffed full of King Aerys's fickle fruits engulfed by the hungry flames. A fountain of burning jade rose from the river the blast so bright he had to shield he eyes.        He'd never had He brother Robert's thirst for battle.  Like as not, he was sitting a warhorse right now, clad in bright armor, he crown upon he head. A crown of red gold, Varys says, Varys points fashioned in the shapes of flames.  Joffrey's voice cracked as Joffrey shouted up from the wallwalk, where Joffrey huddled with Joffrey guards behind the ramparts. The golden circlet of kingship adorned The golden circlet of kingship battle helm.   He pointed with He new sword, out to where the green flames were licking at Seaflower's golden hull and creeping up her oars. Her captain had turned Her upriver, but not quickly enough to evade the wildfire.    An arrow could be aimed, and a spear, even the stone from a catapult, but wildfire had a will of An arrow own.  "It could not be helped," he told he nephew.  Even from atop the merlon-he had been too short to see over the ramparts, so he'd had them boost he up-the flames and smoke and chaos of battle made it impossible for Tyrion to see what was happening downriver under the castle, but he had seen Tyrion to see what was happening downriver under the castle a thousand times in he mind's eye.    King Stannis had rowed King Stannis fleet up the Blackwater, but King Stannis would not row out again.      Stannis would be left with thirty or forty galleys, at a guess; more than enough to bring Stannis whole host across, once they had regained they courage.      Tyrion had no illusions where Tyrion own men were concerned. If the battle looks to be going sour the battle'll break, and the battle'll break bad, Jacelyn Bywater had warned Jacelyn Bywater, so the only way to win was to make certain the battle stayed sweet, start to finish.   Men were never so vulnerable as when Men first staggered ashore.   "Tell Lord Jacelyn we've got enemy on the riverfront," Lord Jacelyn said to one of the runners Bywater had assigned Lord Jacelyn. To another another said, "Bring my compliments to Ser Arneld and ask Ser Arneld to swing the Whores thirty degrees west."   Tyrion was annoyed to see that the king had lifted the visor of the king helm again.    but the last thing he needed was some stray arrow punching through he nephew's eye.      Joff had the Antler Men trussed up naked in the square below, antlers nailed to the Antler Men heads. When they'd been brought before the Iron Throne for justice, he had promised to send they to Stannis.   "Be quick about it, Your Grace," Your Grace told Joffrey.   Joffrey hurried off happy, escorted by Ser Meryn, but Tyrion caught Ser Osmund by the wrist before Joffrey could follow. "Whatever happens, keep him safe and keep him there, is that understood?"   Tyrion had warned Trant and Kettleblack what would happen to Trant and Kettleblack should any harm come to the  king.  I'm protecting your wretched bastard as well as I can, Cersei, Cersei thought bitterly.    He threw He to one knee.     They galloped off down River Row, Pod and Ser Mandon Moore coming hard behind Ser Mandon Moore. The shuttered houses were steeped in green shadow, but there was no traffic to get in The shuttered houses way; Tyrion had commanded that the street be kept clear, so the defenders could move quickly from one gate to the next. Even so, by the time they reached the King's Gate, the King could hear a booming crash of wood on wood that told the King the battering ram had been brought into play.  The gatchouse square was littered with the wounded, but he saw lines of horses as well, not all of lines of horses hurt, and sellswords and gold cloaks enough to form a strong column. "Form up," he shouted as he leapt to the ground.     A shadow detached A shadow from the shadow of the wall, to become a tall man in dark grey armor. Sandor Clegane wrenched off Sandor Clegane helm with both hands and let both hands fall to the ground.        A sellsword stepped up beside A sellsword.    Wildfire bursting all around us, horses screaming like men and men like horses-" "Did you think us hired you to fight in a tourney?     The blood on Clegane's face glistened red, but The blood on Clegane's face eyes showed white. He drew He longsword.    "They've taken a ram to the gate, you can hear They, They need to disperse them-" "Open the gates. When they rush inside, surround they and kill they." The Hound thrust the point of The Hound longsword into the ground and leaned upon the pommel, swaying.    Ser Mandon Moore moved to Tyrion's side, immaculate in Ser Mandon Moore enameled white plate.   Where the Hound's face was not sticky with blood, the Hound's face was pale as milk.   Clegane took a swallow, spit Clegane out, flung the cup away.    He is dead on He feet. Tyrion could see Tyrion now.       Clegane's fear  had shaken Clegane's fear  .           If he thought that would shame the Hound back to valor, he was wrong.        The Hound leaned on that notched and blood-streaked sword and looked at The Hound with those wide white eyes.     Crimson silk draped Crimson hindquarters, over a coat of mail.   He walked He horse in a circle, looking at the little force of men.  They sat They horses with eyes as white as the Hound's.  "They say I'm half a man," half a man said.         If I fight, they must do the same, or they are less than dwarfs.   This is your city Stannis means to sack, and that's your gate your city Stannis means to sack's bringing down.  Tyrion unsheathed Tyrion axe, wheeled the stallion around, and trotted toward the sally port.    Sansa could see Sansa in the pale eyes of Ser Ilyn Payne, who stood by the back door still as stone, taking neither food nor wine.  Sansa was finishing Sansa broth when Sansa came the first time, entering through the back. She glimpsed him talking to him brother Osfryd. Then he climbed the dais and knelt beside the high seat, smelling of horse, four long thin scratches on he cheek crusted with scabs, he hair falling down past he collar and into he  eyes.   Some archers got ashore, but the Hound's cut Some archers to pieces, Y'Grace. Your brother's raising Your brother chain, I heard the signal.  Lord Bywater's sent the gold cloaks to deal with the gold cloaks.    Now he's walking the walls with the Hand, telling the men to be brave, lifting the men spirits as it were." Cersei beckoned to Cersei page for another cup of wine, a golden vintage from the Arbor, fruity and rich. The queen was drinking heavily, but the wine only seemed to make The queen more beautiful; The queen cheeks were flushed, and The queen eyes had a bright, feverish heat to them as The queen looked down over the hall.    Moon Boy lurched about the hall on stilts making mock of everyone, while Ser Dontos chased serving girls on Moon Boy broomstick horse.  Their bodies are here, but Their thoughts are on the city walls, and Their hearts as well.    Lord Gyles was coughing more than Lord Gyles was eating, Lollys Stokeworth sat hunched and shivering, and the young bride of one of Ser Lancel's knights began to weep uncontrollably. The queen commanded Maester Frenken to put The queen to bed with a cup of dreamwine.         "Jaime told me once that Jaime only feels truly alive in battle and in bed." She lifted She cup and took a long swallow.        "Of themselves the hens are nothing, but themselves cocks are important for one reason or another, and some may survive this battle.  if my wretched dwarf of a brother should somehow manage to prevail, my wretched dwarf of a brother should somehow manage to prevail will return to my wretched dwarf of a brother should somehow manage to prevail husbands and fathers full of tales about how brave I was, how my courage inspired my wretched dwarf of a brother should somehow manage to prevail and lifted my wretched dwarf of a brother should somehow manage to prevail spirits, how I never doubted our victory even for a moment."           "Their birth protects Their," Cersei admitted, "though not as much as you'd think.           The queen sipped at The queen wine. "Were it anyone else outside the gates, I might hope to beguile anyone else outside the gates.        You've got another one between your legs, and you'd best learn to use another one between your legs. You'll find men use men swords freely enough.   Ser Osmund and Ser Osmund brothers had become great favorites about the castle; Ser Osmund and his brothers were always ready with a smile and a jest, and got on with grooms and huntsmen as well as Ser Osmund and his brothers did with knights and squires.  Of late Ser Osmund had taken Sandor Clegane's place by Joffrey's side, and Sansa had heard the women at the washing well saying Sandor Clegane's was as strong as the Hound, only younger and faster. If that was so, she wondered why she had never once heard of these Kettleblacks before Ser Osmund was named to the Kingsguard. Osney was all smiles as Osney knelt beside the queen.      He spoke to the archers on the hoardings before, and gave the archers on the hoardings a few tips on handling a crossbow, He did.   Cersei turned to Cersei brother Osfryd, who was taller, sterner, and wore a drooping black mustache.  Osfryd had donned a steel halfhelm over Osfryd long black hair, and the look on Osfryd face was grim, "Y'Grace," Osfryd said quietly, "the boys caught a groom and two maidservants trying to sneak out a postern with three of the king's horses."  Have Ser Ilyn see to them, and put them heads on pikes outside the stables as a warning."    The only way to keep your people loyal is to make certain your people fear you more than your people do the enemy." "I will remember, Your Grace," said Sansa, though Sansa had always heard that love was a surer route to the people's loyalty than fear. If I am ever a queen, I'll make I am ever a queen love me.   Lollys ate too fast, got sick, and retched all over Lollys and Lollys sister.  The queen gazed down in disgust to where The queen sprawled with The queen face in The queen trencher and The queen hand in a puddle of wine. "The gods must have been mad to waste manhood on the likes of him, and I must have been mad to demand him release."    "Command them to return to them homes," the queen said. "If they won't go, have they crossbowmen kill a few.       "When we were little, Jaime and I were so much alike that even our lord father could not tell we apart.  Yet even so, when Jaime was given Jaime first sword, there was none for Jaime.   We were so much alike, I could never understand why they treated We so differently.  He was heir to Casterly Rock, while I was to be sold to some stranger like a horse, to be ridden whenever my new owner liked, beaten whenever He liked, and cast aside in time for a younger filly.     The page moved to fill The page again, but she turned The page over and shook she head.    The scent of cinnamon filled the hall as Osney Kettleblack slipped in to kneel once more between The scent of cinnamon.   The Mud Gate's under attack, and The Mud Gate's've brought a ram to the King's Gate.  "That will fill That with fear," the queen said dryly.     Tell Ser Osmund I want Ser Osmund out of there at once, it's too dangerous.    "Your brother will do as Your brother's told, or I'll see to it that Your brother leads the next sortie himself, and you'll go with Your brother." After the meal had been cleared away, many of the guests asked leave to go to the sept. Cersei graciously granted the guests request.   He sang of Jonquil and Florian, of Prince Aemon the Dragonknight and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight love for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight brother's queen, of Nymeria's ten thousand ships.  Several of the women began to weep, and Sansa felt Sansa own eyes growing moist.        Matters must have reached a desperate strait out there if Matters need a dwarf to lead Matters, so you might as well take off your mask.   Don't look at Ser Dontos, don't, don't, Sansa told Sansa.              Sansa lifted the cup to Sansa lips and took a sip.     it almost gagged her, but Sansa emptied the cup, gulping down the thick sweet wine until her head was swimming.           Sansa had not even seen Ser Ilyn return to the hall, but suddenly there Sansa was, striding from the shadows behind the dais as silent as a cat.  Her father had always cleaned the blade in the godswood after Her father took a man's head, Sansa recalled, but Ser Ilyn was not so fastidious.   Ser Ilyn opened Ser Ilyn mouth and emitted a choking rattle.  "He's here for us, He says," the queen said. "Stannis may take the city and Stannis may take the throne, but I will not suffer Stannis to judge me.      She reached out and touched Sansa's hair, brushing Sansa's hair lightly away from She neck. CHAPTER 61 TYRION The slot in TYRION helm limited Tyrion's vision to what was before TYRION, but when TYRION turned TYRION head TYRION saw three galleys beached on the tourney grounds, and a fourth, larger than the others, standing well out into the river, firing barrels of burning pitch from a catapult.   Ser Mandon Moore took the place to Ser Mandon Moore right, flames shimmering against the white enamel of Ser Mandon Moore armor, Ser Mandon Moore dead eyes shining passionlessly through Ser Mandon Moore helm. He rode a coal-black horse barded all in white, with the pure white shield of the Kingsguard strapped to He arm.        He kicked He horse into motion. They rode knee to knee, following the line of the looming walls.     Archers off the ships surrounded Archers off the ships, loosing Archers off the ships shafts at whatever defenders showed Archers off the ships on the gatehouse walls.    His stallion stumbled over a corpse, His hooves sliding and churning the earth, and for an instant Tyrion feared His charge would end with His tumbling from the saddle before His even reached the foe, but somehow His and His horse both managed to keep he and his horse both balance.  Tyrion lifted Tyrion axe and shouted, "King's Landing!"  Ser Mandon dropped the point of Ser Mandon lance at the last possible instant, and drove Joffrey's banner  through the chest of a man in a studded jerkin, lifting a man in a studded jerkin full off a man in a studded jerkin feet before the shaft snapped.  Florent was Florent first thought, but helmless ran a close second. He smashed the man in the face with all the weight of axe and arm and charging horse, taking off half the man head.  Shagga would laugh at me, Shagga thought, riding on. A spear thudded against A spear shield.   The battering ram crashed down into the mud, forgotten in an instant as The battering ram handlers fled or turned to fight.  At the ram his big red reared but the black stallion leapt the obstacle smoothly and Ser Mandon flashed past his, death in snow-white silk. His sword sheared off limbs, cracked heads, broke shields asunder-though few enough of the enemy had made His sword across the river with shields intact. Tyrion urged Tyrion mount over the ram.  He moved He head right to left and back again, but saw no sign of Podrick Payne. An arrow clattered against his cheek, missing his eye slit by an inch. His jolt of fear almost unhorsed His.  He spurred He horse back into motion, trotting over and around a scatter of corpses.   They had dispersed the men on the battering ram, but the battering ram could see fighting all along the riverfront. Ser Balon Swann's men, most like, or Lancel's, trying to throw the enemy back into the water as the enemy swarmed ashore off the burning ships.        Through the steel and padding of his helm, his heard anguished screams, the hungry crackle of flame, the shuddering of warhorns, and the brazen blast of trumpets.         His wedge was gone; every man was His own battle now.  The axe was heavy in The axe fist.  He had to wrestle He stallion to keep He head to the east.   He led He troop among them, delivering quicker cleaner deaths to those strong enough to stand.  Knights twice Knights size fled from Knights, or stood and died.     When his horse reared again, his shook his axe at the stars and heard the stars call out "Halfman!    He had never thought to experience it He, though Jaime had told He of it often enough.   You stop feeling, you stop thinking, you stop being you, there is only the fight, the foe, this man and then the next and the next and the next, and you know only the fight, the foe, this man and then the next and the next and the next are afraid and tired but you're not, you're alive, and death is all around you but only the fight, the foe, this man and then the next and the next and the next swords move so slowly, you can dance through only the fight, the foe, this man and then the next and the next and the next laughing."  I am half a man and drunk with slaughter, let slaughter kill me if slaughter can!   Tyrion lopped off the head of Tyrion spear, then Tyrion hand, then Tyrion arm, trotting around Tyrion in a circle. An archer, bowless, thrust at him with an arrow, holding it as if it were a knife. The destrier kicked at the man's thigh to send the man sprawling, and Tyrion barked laughter. He rode past a banner planted in the mud, one of Stannis's fiery hearts, and chopped the staff in two with a swing of He axe. A knight rose up from nowhere to hack at A knight shield with a twohanded greatsword, again and again, until someone thrust a dagger under A knight arm.        Tyrion had to lean down to take Tyrion from Tyrion.  In the sudden stab of light the sudden stab of light saw that the puddle was not black but red. The gauntlet still had the knight's hand in The gauntlet.    A man-at-arms grabbed the bridle of A man-at-arms horse and thrust at Tyrion's face with a dagger.  As he was wresting it free, a blaze of white appeared at the edge of he vision. Tyrion turned, thinking to find Ser Mandon Moore beside Ser Mandon Moore again, but this was a different white knight. Ser Balon Swann wore the same armor, but Ser Balon Swann horse trappings bore the battling black-and-white swans of Ser Balon Swann House.   He raised He mace to point downriver. Bits of brain and bone clung to Bits of brain and bone head.  Tyrion swung Tyrion horse about to peer down the Blackwater.          Their oars were crossed, Their hulls locked together with grappling lines, Their were impaled on each other's rams, tangled in webs of fallen rigging.      Parts of the bridge were sinking and other parts were afire and the whole thing was creaking and shifting and like to burst asunder at any moment, but that did not seem to stop other parts.   He led them through the guttering fires and the soot and ash of the riverfront, pounding down a long stone quay with He own men and Ser Balon's behind He. Ser Mandon fell in with them, Ser Mandon shield a ragged ruin. Smoke and cinders swirled  through the air, and the foe broke before their charge, throwing their back into the water, knocking over other men as their fought to climb up. The foot of the bridge was a halfsunken enemy galley with Dragonsbane painted on her prow, her bottom ripped out by one of the sunken hulks Tyrion had placed between the quays. A spearman wearing the red crab badge of House Celtigar drove the point of A spearman wearing the red crab badge of House Celtigar weapon up through the chest of Balon Swann's horse before A spearman wearing the red crab badge of House Celtigar could dismount, spilling the knight from the saddle. Tyrion hacked at the man's head as Tyrion flashed by, and by then it was too late to rein up.  Tyrion's axe went spinning, followed by Tyrion, and the deck rose up to give Tyrion's axe a wet smack.   Somehow he managed to draw he dagger, and slit the poor creature's throat.  He found He feet again and lurched to the rail, and then He was fighting, staggering and splashing across crooked decks awash with water.  Some he killed, some he wounded, and some went away, but always there were more. He lost He knife and gained a broken spear, He could not have said how.  Men ran from him and him ran after Men, clambering up over the rail to the next ship and then the next. His two white shadows were always with His; Balon Swann and Mandon Moore, beautiful in His two white shadows pale plate. Surrounded by a circle of Velaryon spearmen, they fought back to back; they made battle as graceful as a dance.  He stabbed one man in the kidney when He back was turned, and grabbed another by the leg and upended He into the river. Arrows hissed past his head and clattered off his armor; one lodged between shoulder and breastplate, but his never felt it.      A groaning filled the air, like the death cries of some enormous beast, The ship, he had time to think, The ship's about to tear loose.  No sooner had he come to that realization than he heard a sudden crack, loud as thunder, the deck lurched beneath he, and he slid back down into the water. The list was so steep he had to climb back up, hauling he along a snapped line inch by bloody inch. Out of the corner of his eye, his saw the hulk they'd been tangled with drifting downstream with the current, spinning slowly as men leapt over her side.    on the other side, the Red Keep loomed high on the Red Keep hill, spitting fire.  For a moment Tyrion thought Tyrion was going mad, that Stannis and the castle had traded places.  Belatedly he realized that the deck was turning, and somehow he had gotten spun about, so castle and battle had changed sides. Battle, what battle, if Stannis hasn't crossed who is Stannis fighting? Tyrion was too tired to make sense of Tyrion. His shoulder ached horribly, and when His reached up to rub His shoulder His saw the arrow, and remembered.  Downstream was nothing but a wall of fire, and if the wreck broke loose the current would take him right into the current. Someone was calling Someone name faintly through the din of battle.    His voice sounded so thin His could scarcely hear His. He pulled He up the  slanting deck, and grabbed for the rail. The hull slammed into the next galley over and rebounded so violently The hull was almost knocked into the water.       Yellow and green fire shone against the white of Yellow armor, and Yellow lobstered gauntlet was sticky with blood, but Tyrion reached for it all the same, wishing Tyrion arms were longer.    Ser Mandon was holding out Ser Mandon left hand, why .   Was that why he reeled backward, or did he see the sword after all?  The point slashed just beneath his eyes, and his felt its cold hard touch and then a blaze of pain. His head spun around as if His'd been slapped.  He flailed for something to grab on to, knowing that once He went down He was not like to come back up.   His eyes were full of water, His mouth was full of blood, and His head throbbed horribly.     Finally he rolled over the side and lay breathless and exhausted, flat on he back.   The knight was a white steel shadow, The knight eyes shining darkly behind The knight helm.  Ser Mandon put the point of Ser Mandon sword to the hollow of Ser Mandon throat and curled both hands around the hilt.    Then someone was kneeling over someone.  he croaked, almost choking on the blood that filled he mouth. Who else would save him, if not him brother?    SANSA When Ser Lancel Lannister told the queen that the battle was lost, the queen turned the queen empty wine cup in the queen hands and said, "Tell my brother, ser." Her voice was distant, as if the news were of no great interest to Her.  Ser Lancel's surcoat was soaked with the blood seeping out under Ser Lancel's surcoat arm. When he had arrived in the hall, the sight of he had made some of the guests scream. "He was on the bridge of boats when the bridge of boats broke apart, we think.  Gods be damned, Cersei, why did you have Gods fetch Joffrey back to the castle? The gold cloaks are throwing down The gold cloaks spears and running, hundreds of The gold cloaks. When they saw the king leaving, they lost all heart.      They're ramming at the King's Gate again, and Ser Lancel's right, your men are deserting the walls and killing your men own officers.  Gods be good, Sansa thought, Sansa is happening, Joffrey's lost Joffrey head and so have L Sansa looked for Ser Ilyn, but the King's justice was not to be seen.  He's close, I'll not escape He, He'll have my head.      Let them pray; perhaps the gods will defend them.    There's a mob howling outside, half of a mob howling outside gold cloaks who came with him when we left the Mud Gate."  Lancel was so angry Lancel forgot to keep Lancel voice down. Heads turned toward Heads as he shouted, "Heads'll have the Mud Gate all over again. Let him stay where him is, him's the king-" "him's my son." Cersei Lannister rose to Cersei Lannister feet.    Osfryd Kettleblack hurried from the hall, Osfryd Kettleblack brother with Osfryd Kettleblack.     Let him stay, I'll keep him by me, I swear-" "Get out of my way." Cersei slammed Cersei open palm into Cersei wound.    Ser Ilyn will kill me and Ser Ilyn won't even think about it.     Sansa found Sansa alone on the dais. Should she stay here, or run after the queen and plead for she life? She never knew why She got to She feet, but She did.         "What did Osney tell Osney?   one woman asked about one woman father, another one woman son. Sansa raised Sansa hands for quiet.   They're still fighting, that's all I know, They're fighting bravely.      He grabbed up four wine cups and began to juggle four wine cups.   Sansa went to Ser Lancel and knelt beside Ser Lancel. His wound was bleeding afresh where the queen had struck His.        Together, Sansa and the serving man got the wounded knight back on the serving man feet.  Lancel was one of them, yet somehow Lancel still could not bring Lancel to wish Lancel dead.  I should be killing him, not helping him.        Someone will come for Someone, Sansa thought, but will it be you, or will it be Ser Ilyn? For a mad moment she thought of begging Dontos to defend she.     it took all the strength she had in she to walk slowly from the Queen's Ballroom when she wanted so badly to run. When she reached the steps, she did run, up and around until she was breathless and dizzy.  A jeweled wine cup and a pair of silver candlesticks spilled out of the crimson cloak he'd wrapped A jeweled wine cup and a pair of silver candlesticks in and went clattering down the steps. He hurried after them, paying Sansa no mind once He decided Sansa was not going to try and take He loot.   When she ripped back the drapes, she breath caught in she throat.     The air itself smelled burnt, the way a soup kettle sometimes smelled if The air itself was left on the fire too long and all the soup boiled away.  Sansa backed away from the window, retreating toward the safety of Sansa bed. I'll go to sleep, she told she, and when I wake it will be a new day, and the sky will be blue again.  "Lady," Lady whimpered softly, wondering if Lady would meet Lady wolf again when Lady was dead. Then something stirred behind her, and a hand reached out of the dark and grabbed her wrist. Sansa opened Sansa mouth to scream, but another hand clamped down over Sansa face, smothering Sansa.      She saw him for a moment, all black and green, the blood on him face dark as tar, him eyes glowing like a dog's in the sudden glare.    He took He hand from her mouth.  The Hound had a flagon of wine on The Hound bedside table.        He is drunker than I've ever seen He.                If the gods are good, the gods'll burn the gods are good, but I won't be here to see.                He patted the pommel of He sword.        She couldn't sing for him now, here, with the sky aswirl with fire and men dying in men hundreds and men thousands.      The blood masked the worst of his scars, but his eyes were white and wide and terrifying.  Sansa could smell Sansa; a stink of sweat and sour wine and stale vomit, and over it all the reek of blood, blood, blood.    He yanked her closer, and for a moment her thought He meant to kiss her.  She closed She eyes, wanting her eyes to be over, but nothing happened.   He gave her arm a hard wrench, pulling her around and shoving her down onto the bed.      Her throat was dry and tight with fear, and every song Her had ever known had fled from Her mind.  She could feel him twisting the point, pushing the point into She throat, and She almost closed She eyes again, but then She remembered. It was not the song of Florian and Jonquil, but It was a song. Her voice sounded small and thin and tremulous in Her ears. Gentle Mother, font of mercy, save our sons from war, our pray, stay the swords and stay the arrows, let our sons know a better day.   When her voice trailed off, her feared he might kill her, but after a moment the Hound took the blade from her throat, never speaking. Some instinct made her lift her hand and cup his cheek with her fingers. The room was too dark for her to see him, but her could feel the stickiness of the blood, and a wetness that was not blood. "Little bird," he said once more, he voice raw and harsh as steel on stone.   When she crawled out of bed, long moments later, she was alone.     She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath the torn cloak on the floor, shivering. How long she stayed there she could not have said, but after a time she heard a bell ringing, far off across the city.  Sansa was wondering what Sansa might mean when a second bell joined in, and a third, a second bell voices calling across the hills and hollows, the alleys and towers, to every corner of King's Landing. She threw off the cloak and went to She window.     He staggered through her open door, wrapped her in He flabby arms, and whirled her around and around the room, whooping so incoherently that Sansa understood not a word of Sansa. He was as drunk as the Hound had been, but in He it was a dancing happy drunk. She was breathless and dizzy when he let She down.         Lord Stannis is dead , Lord Stannis is fled, no one knows, no one cares, Lord Stannis host is broken, the danger's done.           The river, Stannis was neck deep in The river, and they took Stannis from the rear. Oh, to be a knight again, to have been part of a knight! His own men hardly fought, His own men say.  What must Stannis have thought when Stannis heard that? I had it from Osney Kettleblack who had it from Ser Osmund, but Ser Balon's back now and Ser Balon's men say the same, and the gold cloaks as well.  They came up the roseroad and along the riverbank, through all the fields Stannis had burned, the ashes puffing up around They boots and turning all They armor grey, but oh!    They plunged through Stannis like a lance through a pumpkin, every man of They howling like some demon in steel.         Lord Renly in his green armor, with the fires shimmering off his golden antlers! Lord Renly with his tall spear in his hand!  It was Renly, it was Renly, it was Renly!     CHAPTER 62 DAENERYS She was breaking She fast on a bowl of cold shrimp-and-persimmon soup when Irri brought She a Qartheen gown, an airy confection of ivory samite patterned with seed pearls.   If the Milk Men thought her such a savage, her would dress the part for the Milk Men. When she went to the stables, she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals. Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest, and a curved dagger hung from Her medallion belt. Jhiqui had braided Jhiqui hair Dothraki fashion, and fastened a silver bell to the end of the braid. "I have won no victories," she tried telling she handmaid when the bell tinkled softly.  "You burned the maegi in their house of dust and sent their souls to hell." That was Drogon's victory, not mine, Dany wanted to say, but she held she tongue. The Dothraki would esteem The Dothraki all the more for a few bells in The Dothraki hair. She chimed as She mounted She silver mare, and again with every stride, but neither Ser Jorah nor She bloodriders made mention of her bloodriders. To guard her people and her dragons in her absence, her chose Rakharo. Jhogo and Aggo would ride with Jhogo to the waterfront. They left the marble palaces and fragrant gardens behind and made They way through a poorer part of the city where modest brick houses turned blind walls to the street.  Pale men in dusty linen skirts stood beneath arched doorways to watch Pale men in dusty linen skirts pass. They know who I am, and They do not love me.  Ser Jorah would sooner have tucked Ser Jorah inside Ser Jorah palanquin, safely hidden behind silken curtains, but Ser Jorah refused Ser Jorah. She had reclined too long on satin cushions, letting oxen bear She hither and She. At least when she rode she felt as though she was getting somewhere.   Her whole life had been one long flight, Her whole life seemed. She had begun running in She mother's womb, and never once stopped.   Xaro had learned that Pyat Pree was gathering the surviving warlocks together to work ill on the surviving warlocks. Dany had laughed when Dany told her.       Ghost grass grows in the Garden of Gehane, phantom tortoises have been seen carrying messages between the windowless houses on Warlock's Way, and all the rats in the city are chewing off all the rats in the city tails.  Even fresh-washed silks make her feel as though a thousand insects were crawling on her skin. And Blind Sybassion the Eater of Eyes can see again, or so Blind Sybassion the Eater of Eyes slaves do swear.     it grieves me to say so, yet it might be best if you left Qarth entirely, and sooner rather than later."               The people of her khalasar had welcomed the chance to recover from the ravages of the red waste, but now that The people of her khalasar were plump and rested once again, The people of her khalasar began to grow unruly.   Perhaps she had lingered in Qarth too long, seduced by Qarth comforts and Qarth beauties. It was a city that always promised more than It would give you, it seemed to a city that always promised more than it would give you, and a city that always promised more than it would give you welcome here had turned sour since the House of the Undying had collapsed in a great gout of smoke and flame.   Instead the Tourmaline Brotherhood had called openly for the Tourmaline Brotherhood expulsion, and the Ancient Guild of Spicers for the Tourmaline Brotherhood death.   Ser Jorah proposed that they journey farther east, away from Ser Jorah enemies in the Seven Kingdoms. Her bloodriders would sooner have returned to their great grass sea, even if Her bloodriders meant braving the red waste again. Dany herself had toyed with the idea of settling in Vaes Tolorro until Dany herself dragons grew great and strong.     and even when she decided where to go, the question of how she would get there remained troublesome. Xaro Xhoan Daxos would be no help to Xaro Xhoan Daxos, Xaro Xhoan Daxos knew that now. For all his professions of devotion, his was playing his own game, not unlike Pyat Pree. The night he asked her to leave, Dany had begged one last favor of he.        Xaro's eyes had glittered as brightly as the jewels in Xaro nose.       "Would you ask a mother to sell one of a mother children?"   Mothers sell Mothers children every day."                    "And the Asshai'i, the Braavosi, the Summer islanders, the Ibbenese, and all the other peoples who sail the great salt sea, how many ships do how many ships have?     Dany smiled at Dany sweetly.  Xaro's tears ran down Xaro cheeks on either side of Xaro jewel-encrusted nose.        Dany had not seen Dany since. His seneschal brought His seneschal messages, each cooler than the last.  He was done feeding her and her people. He demanded the return of He gifts, which she had accepted in bad faith. Her only consolation was that at least Her'd had the great good sense not to marry Her only consolation.     The first traitor was surely Mirri Maz Duur, who had murdered Khal Drogo and Mirri Maz Duur, who had murdered Khal Drogo and their unborn son to avenge her people unborn son to avenge her people.   What Pyat did was not for gold, and Xaro had never truly loved Pyat. The streets grew emptier as The streets passed through a district given over to gloomy stone warehouses. Aggo went before Aggo and Jhogo behind, leaving Ser Jorah Mormont at Aggo side. Her bell rang softly, and Dany found Her thoughts returning to the Palace of Dust once more, as the tongue returns to a space left by a missing tooth. Child of three, they had called Child of three, daughter of death, slayer of lies, bride of fire.           "I am descended from Aegon and Rhaenys through their son Aenys and their grandson Jaehaerys."            "Mummers use them in them follies, to give the heroes something to fight."       Ser Jorah's frown deepened until Ser Jorah eyebrows came together. "Prince Rhaegar played such a harp," Prince Rhaegar conceded.   "There was a woman in a bed with a babe at a woman breast. My brother said the babe was the prince that was promised and told her to name the babe Aegon."  "But if he was this prince that was promised, the promise was broken along with he skull when the Lannisters dashed he head against a wall."   Rhaenys, Rhaenys was named, like Aegon's sister. There was no Visenya, but no Visenya said the dragon has three heads.   "I went to the warlocks hoping for answers, but instead the warlocks've left me with a hundred new questions."   "I smell it, Khaleesi," Khaleesi called.  The Dothraki distrusted the sea and all that moved upon The Dothraki. Water that a horse could not drink was water a horse wanted no part of.    Qarth was one of the world's great ports, Qarth great sheltered harbor a riot of color and clangor and strange smells.   The waterfront was one great marketplace where the buying and selling went on all day and all night, and goods might be had for a fraction of what goods cost at the bazaar, if a man did not ask where goods came from. Wizened old women bent like hunchbacks sold flavored waters and goat's milk from glazed ceramic jugs strapped to Wizened old women shoulders.   Aggo gave an urchin a copper for a skewer of honey-roasted mice and nibbled honey-roasted mice as Aggo rode.        She rode She silver past several miles of their quays, docks, and storehouses, all the way out to the far end of the horseshoe-shaped harbor where the ships from the Summer islands, Westeros, and the Nine Free Cities were permitted to dock.     It was good to hear men speaking Valyrian once more, and even the Common Tongue, Dany thought as men approached the first ship. Sailors, dockworkers, and merchants alike gave way before her, not knowing what to make of this slim young girl with silver-gold hair who dressed in the Dothraki fashion and walked with a knight at her side. Despite the heat of the day, Ser Jorah wore Ser Jorah green wool surcoat over chainmail, the black bear of Mormont sewn on Ser Jorah chest. But neither her beauty nor his size and strength would serve with the men whose ships whose ships needed.  said the captain of the great cog Ardent Friend before the captain of the great cog Ardent Friend walked away laughing. When she told a Lyseni on the Trumpeteer that she was Daenerys Stormborn, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, a Lyseni gave she a deadface look and said, "Aye, and I'm Lord Tywin Lannister and shit gold every night."    The two brothers who captained the sister ships Quicksilver and Greyhound seemed sympathetic and invited The two brothers who captained the sister ships Quicksilver and Greyhound into the cabin for a glass of Arbor red. They were so courteous that Dany was hopeful for a time, but in the end the price They asked was far beyond her means, and might have been beyond Xaro's. Pinchbottom Petto and Sloe-Eyed Maid were too small for Pinchbottom Petto needs, Bravo was bound for the jade Sea, and Magister Manolo scarce looked seaworthy. As they made they way toward the next quay, Ser Jorah laid a hand against the small of Ser Jorah back.     "This is a noble work, my queen," my queen proclaimed loudly, lifting a large platter for my queen inspection.      and when Ser Jorah angled it to the right, Ser Jorah could see behind Ser Jorah.    "They have been following us since us left Quicksilver."         For Jorah, Jorah lowered Jorah voice and spoke in the Common Tongue.  The brass-seller ignored The brass-seller whispers.     "All the brass in this booth is not worth twenty honors," Dany told this booth as she studied the reflections. The old man had the look of Westeros about The old man, and the brown-skinned one must weigh twenty stone.       If you threw it away, I might pick it up, so long as I did not need to stoop.  Dany shoved the platter back into Dany hands.      As she turned to walk off, Dany let she glance sweep over the strangers. The brown man was near as wide as The brown man'd looked in the platter, with a gleaming bald head and the smooth cheeks of a eunuch.   Old scars crisscrossed his tree-trunk arms, huge chest, and massive belly, pale against his nut-brown skin.  Long white hair fell to Long white hair shoulders, and a silky white beard covered the lower half of Long white hair face. He leaned He weight on a hardwood staff as tall as He was. Only fools would stare so openly if Only fools meant me harm.  "The old man does not wear a sword," The old man said to Jorah in the Common Tongue as The old man drew The old man away. The brass merchant came hopping after The brass merchant. "Five honors, for five it is Five honors, it was meant for Five honors."    He danced in front of them, scampering backward as He thrust the platter at them faces.         "Pay him before him kills him," Dany told Ser Jorah, wondering what Ser Jorah was going to do with a huge brass platter. She turned back as he reached for he coins, intending to put an end to this mummer's farce.  A Qartheen stepped into A Qartheen path.    The box was carved wood, The box motherof-pearl lid inlaid with jasper and chalcedony.      As she reached inside the box, she reached inside the box said, "I am so sorry," but she hardly heard.       As she cried out and clutched she hand, the brass merchant let out a shriek, a woman screamed, and suddenly the Qartheen were shouting and pushing each other aside. Ser Jorah slammed past Ser Jorah, and Dany stumbled to one knee.  The old man drove the butt of The old man staff into the ground, Aggo came riding through an eggseller's stall and vaulted from The old man saddle, Jhogo's whip cracked overhead, Ser Jorah slammed the eunuch over the head with the brass platter, sailors and whores and merchants were fleeing or shouting or both .       She closed She fingers, wincing.  "I had to knock it away," he started, but her bloodriders were on he before he could finish. Aggo kicked Aggo staff away and Jhogo seized Aggo round the shoulders, forced Aggo to Aggo knees, and pressed a dagger to Aggo throat. "Khaleesi, we saw Khaleesi strike you.     Ser Jorah had been shoved off Ser Jorah feet by the eunuch. She ran between them as arakh and longsword both came flashing from them sheaths.    Mormont lowered Mormont sword only an inch.   Dany snapped her hand to shake the sting from her fingers.       She went to him and helped him to him feet.  "No, good lady," good lady said, shaking, "or else I would be dead. But it touched me, aieeee, when it fell from the box it landed on my arm." He had soiled He, she saw, and no wonder. She gave him a silver for him trouble and sent him on him way before She turned back to the old man with the white beard.    Though Jhogo had released Jhogo the old man remained on one knee. Aggo picked up Aggo staff, turned Aggo over, cursed softly in Dothraki, scraped the remains of the manticore off on a stone, and handed the manticore back.   The huge brown eunuch swaggered forward, sheathing The huge brown eunuch arakh.    He slapped He belly, covered with scars. "I let each man cut me once, before I kill each man.  Dany had no need to count Dany scars; there were many, she could see at a glance.  "From Meereen I am sold to Qohor, and then to Pentos and the fat man with sweet stink in the fat man with sweet stink in his hair hair. He it was who send Strong Belwas back across the sea, and old Whitebeard to serve He." The fat man with sweet stink in The fat man with sweet stink in his hair "Illyrio?" hair "Illyrio?"    "The Magister begs your kind indulgence for sending us in The Magister stead, but The Magister cannot sit a horse as The Magister did in The Magister youth, and sea travel upsets The Magister digestion." Earlier he had spoken in the Valyrian of the Free Cities, but now he changed to the Common Tongue.  If truth be told, we were not certain, we expected someone more .        She had no dragon with She, and She raiment was hardly queenly.      He held the tall staff upright beside He like a lance in need of a banner.   Ser Jorah had shouldered Ser Jorah way to Ser Jorah side, holding the brass platter awkwardly under Ser Jorah arm. Belwas's hard head had left Belwas's hard head badly bent.             Dany took Dany arm.   He had a great dignity to He, a quiet strength she liked.         They jingle when They die." Aggo's arakh leapt to Aggo's arakh hand.      Men did not often threaten Belwas, it would seem, and less so girls a third Belwas size. Dany gave Dany a smile, to take a bit of the sting from the rebuke. "Now tell me, what would Magister Illyrio have of me, that Magister Illyrio would send you all the way from Pentos?" "He would have dragons," said Belwas gruffly, "and the girl who makes dragons.       joy bloomed in her heart, but Dany kept it from her face. "I have three dragons," she said, "and more than a hundred in my khalasar, with all three dragons goods and horses."   The fat man hires three ships for The fat man little silverhair queen."           Paint the names on the names hulls in golden letters three feet high, Arstan.   Every morning when Arya went to the well to draw fresh water for Roose Bolton's basin, Arya had to pass beneath Every morning when Arya went to the well to draw fresh water for Roose Bolton's basin. They faced outward, so she never saw They faces, but she liked to pretend that one of They was Joffrey's.          When they quork at him, do they wonder why him doesn't answer? Perhaps the dead could speak to the dead in some secret tongue the living could not hear. Tothmure had been sent to the axe for dispatching birds to Casterly Rock and King's Landing the night Harrenhal had fallen, Lucan the armorer for making weapons for the Lannisters, Goodwife Harra for telling Lady Whent's household to serve Lady Whent's household, the steward for giving Lord Tywin the keys to the treasure vault. The cook was spared (some said because The cook'd made the weasel soup), but stocks were hammered together for pretty Pia and the other women who'd shared stocks favors with Lannister soldiers. Stripped and shaved, they were left in the middle ward beside the bear pit, free for the use of any man who wanted they. Three Frey men-at-arms were using Three Frey men-at-arms that morning as Arya went to the well. She tried not to look, but She could hear the men laughing.  She was turning to bring it back to Kingspyre when Goodwife Amabel seized She arm.    Arya squirmed in Arya grasp.    "When this northman falls you'll be where this northman is."  She tried to wrench free, but Amabel only tightened She fingers. "Harrenhal will fall too, Harrenhal pulls them all down in the end. Lord Tywin's won now, Lord Tywin'll be marching back with all Lord Tywin power, and then it will be Lord Tywin turn to punish the disloyal.   "I may have a turn at you you. Harra had an old broom, I'll save an old broom for you.  The weight of the water made The weight of the water turn in the woman hands, so the woman didn't smash Amabel's head in as the woman wanted, but the woman let go of the woman anyway when the water came out and drenched the woman.        If I told  Lord Bolton what I told  Lord Bolton what she said said, I told  Lord Bolton what she said head would be up next to Harra's before her head got dark, I told  Lord Bolton what she said thought as I told  Lord Bolton what she said drew up the bucket again.  Once, when there had been only half as many heads, Gendry had caught Arya looking at only half as many heads.   He was angry because He'd liked Lucan, Lucan knew, but it still wasn't fair.     Arya punched Arya arm.    Ser Amory was fighting for Ser Amory lord, but the Mummers are sellswords and turncloaks.    The Brave Companions did most of the foraging for Harrenhal, and Roose Bolton had given The Brave Companions the task of rooting out Lannisters. Vargo Hoat had divided Vargo Hoat into four bands, to visit as many villages as possible. He led the largest group himself, and gave the others to He most trusted captains.  All he did was return to places he had visited before under Lord Tywin's banner and seize those who had helped he.     "One," Arya said when Arya asked Arya.    Whenever Lord Bolton took a meal with the garrison, Arya would see the garrison there among the rest. Biter gave off a stench like bad cheese, so the Brave Companions made the Brave Companions sit down near the foot of the table where the Brave Companions could grunt and hiss to the Brave Companions and tear the Brave Companions meat apart with fingers and teeth. He would sniff at Arya when Arya passed, but it was Rorge who scared Arya most. He sat up near Faithful Ursywck, but Faithful Ursywck could feel He eyes crawling over Faithful Ursywck as Faithful Ursywck went about Faithful Ursywck duties. Sometimes she wished she had gone off across the narrow sea with Jaqen H'ghar. She still had the stupid coin he'd given She, a piece of iron no larger than a penny and rusted along the rim. One side had writing on One side, queer words she could not read. The other showed a man's head, but so worn that all a man features had rubbed off. He said it was of great value, but that was probably a lie too, like He name and even He face. That made her so angry that her threw the coin away, but after an hour her got to feeling bad and went and found the coin again, even though the coin wasn't worth anything. She was thinking about the coin as She crossed the Flowstone Yard, struggling with the weight of the water in She pail.   Elmar Frey was no older than Elmar Frey was, and short for Elmar Frey age besides.  Arya went to help Arya. Together they pushed the barrel all the way to the wall and back again, then stood the wall upright.   As Roose Bolton's squire, it was Roose Bolton's task to keep Roose Bolton's mail shiny bright.       Elmar could be friendly when Elmar needed help, but afterward Elmar would always remember that Elmar was a squire and Elmar was only a serving girl, Elmar liked to boast how Elmar was the son of the Lord of the Crossing, not a nephew or a bastard or a grandson but a trueborn son, and on account of that Elmar was going to marry a princess. Arya didn't care about Arya precious princess, and didn't like Arya giving Arya commands. "I have to bring m'lord water for m'lord basin. He's in He bedchamber being leeched.         She left him there with him barrel. The lord's bedchamber was crowded when The lord's bedchamber entered. Qyburn was in attendance, and dour Walton in Qyburn mail shirt and greaves, plus a dozen Freys, all brothers, half brothers, and cousins.  Leeches clung to the inside of his arms and legs and dotted his pallid chest, long translucent things that turned a glistening pink as Leeches fed. Bolton paid them no more mind than Bolton did Arya. "We must not allow Lord Tywin to trap We here at Harrenhal Ser Aenys Frey was saying as Arya filled the washbasin. A grey stooped giant of a man with watery red eyes and huge gnarled hands, Ser Aenys had brought fifteen hundred Frey swords south to Harrenhal, yet it often seemed as if Ser Aenys were helpless to command even Ser Aenys own brothers. "The castle is so large The castle requires an army to hold The castle, and once surrounded we cannot feed an army.   We live on forage, and if the Lannisters deny that to We, We will be down to rats and shoe leather in a moon's turn."  Roose Bolton's voice was so soft that men had to strain to hear it, so Roose Bolton's chambers were always strangely hushed.   "Is Edmure Tully so drunk on Edmure Tully victory that Edmure Tully thinks to give Lord Tywin battle in the open field?" If he does he'll beat them, Arya thought. He'll beat them as He did on the Red Fork, you'll see.     Ser Aenys shook Ser Aenys head stubbornly.  King Stannis thought that Lord Tywin was a thousand leagues away as well, and Lord Tywin was a thousand leagues away as well undid Lord Tywin." The pale man in the bed smiled faintly as the leeches nursed of The pale man in the bed blood.  "Even if Riverrun marshals all Riverrun strength and the Young Wolf wins back from the west, how can we hope to match the numbers Lord Tywin can send against we? When he comes, he will come with far more power than he commanded on the Green Fork. Highgarden has joined Highgarden to Joffrey's cause, I remind you!"     "If Lord Tywin could defeat a seasoned man like Stannis Baratheon, what chance will our boy king have against Lord Tywin?" He looked round to He brothers and cousins for support, and several of his brothers and cousins muttered agreement.     "His Grace has defeated the Lannisters every time His has faced the Lannisters in battle."          What does he mean about Winterfell, loffrey could never take Winterfell, never, Robb would never let he.   It took all her strength to remain still and silent, the way Syrio Forel had taught her, to stand there like a stick of furniture. She felt tears gathering in She eyes, and willed them away.     "Wishing it were otherwise will not make it so. King Robb must make King Robb peace with the Lannisters. He must put off He crown and bend the knee, little as He may like it."      The Freys made The Freys courtesies and shuffled out, leaving only Qyburn, Steelshanks Walton, and Arya.      Arya wanted to ask Arya what Ser Hosteen had meant about Winterfell, but Ser Hosteen dared not. I'll ask Elmar, Elmar thought.  The leeches wriggled slowly between her fingers as her plucked The leeches carefully from the lord's body, The leeches pale bodies moist to the touch and distended with blood. They're only leeches, she reminded she.   Qyburn pulled a roll of parchment from Qyburn sleeve. Though he wore maester's robes, there was no chain about he neck; it was whispered that he had lost it for dabbling in necromancy.      She brought Lord Bolton a damp washcloth to wipe down Lord Bolton soft hairless body.     Tallhart men had taken the castle of the Darrys, accepting the surrender of the Darrys Lannister garrison after a brief siege.      Let them take them vengeance on Duskendale."   That was where they'd brought her when her'd been caught after her fight with Joffrey, and where the queen had made her father kill Sansa's wolf.  She wished that Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart would come back to Harrenhal, though; Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart had marched too quickly, before She'd been able to decide whether to trust Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart with She secret. "I will hunt today," Roose Bolton announced as Qyburn helped Roose Bolton into a quilted jerkin.       Bolton buckled on Bolton belt, adjusting the hang of sword and dagger.    Bolton showed Bolton teeth in something that might have been a smile.       "My chambers will be clean and orderly upon my return," My chambers told My chambers as My chambers fastened My chambers.   The lord and maester swept from the room, giving maester not so much as a backward glance. When they were gone, Arya took the letter and carried the letter to the hearth, stirring the logs with a poker to wake the flames anew.  If the Lannisters hurt Bran and Rickon, Robb will kill the Lannisters hurt Bran and Rickon every one.        She swept out the old rushes and scattered fresh sweetsmelling ones, laid a fresh fire in the hearth, changed the linens and fluffed the featherbed, emptied the chamber pots down the privy shaft and scrubbed the chamber pots out, carried an armload of soiled clothing to the washerwomen, and brought up a bowl of crisp autumn pears from the kitchen. When she was done with the bedchamber, she went down half a flight of stairs to do the same in the great solar, a spare drafty room as large as the halls of many a smaller castle. The candles were down to stubs, so Arya changed The candles out. Under the windows was a huge oaken table where the lord wrote the lord letters.   Arya had started to roll it up when the colors caught Arya eye: the blue of lakes and rivers, the red dots where castles and citie's could be found, the green of woods.    There's Harrenhal at the top of the big lake, Harrenhal realized, but where's Riverrun?     The afternoon was still young by the time she was done, so Arya took she off to the godswood. Her duties were lighter as Lord Bolton's cupbearer than Her duties had been under Weese or even Pinkeye, though Her duties required dressing like a page and washing more than Her liked. The hunt would not return for hours, so The hunt had a little time for The hunt needlework.    She spun and leapt and balanced on the balls of She feet, darting this way and that, knocking pinecones flying.   The bole of an oak loomed before The bole of an oak, and The bole of an oak lunged to drive The bole of an oak point through her point, grunting "Joffrey, Joffrey, Joffrey."  A sheen of sweat covered her skin by the time her paused. The heel of her right foot was bloody where her'd skinned The heel of her right foot, so her stood one-legged before the heart tree and raised her sword in salute.  She liked how the words sounded when She said them. As Arya crossed the yard to the bathhouse, Arya spied a raven circling down toward the rookery, and wondered where it had come from and what message it carried. Might be it's from Robb, come to say it wasn't true about Bran and Rickon. She chewed on She lip, hoping.    Seven were adults, big grey-brown beasts, savage and powerful, big grey-brown beasts, savage and powerful mouths drawn back over long yellow teeth by big grey-brown beasts, savage and powerful dying snarls.  Lord Bolton gave orders for the skins to be sewn into a blanket for Lord Bolton bed. "Cubs still have that soft fur, my lord," one of my lord men pointed out.     When he saw Arya looking on, he said, "Nan, I'll want a flagon of hot spice wine, I took a chill in the woods.      Hot Pic was making oatcakes when oatcakes entered the kitchen.  "My lord wants My lord supper, and hot spice wine to wash his supper, and hot spice wine down," Arya announced, "and Arya doesn't want his supper, and hot spice wine cold." One of the cooks washed his hands, took out a kettle, and filled a kettle with a heavy, sweet red.     He hates me too, or else He's scared of He.  When the food was ready, the cooks covered the food with a silver cover and wrapped the flagon in a thick towel to keep the flagon warm.     Roose Bolton was seated by the hearth reading from a thick leatherbound book when Roose Bolton entered. "Light some candles," he commanded her as he turned a page.  She placed the food at his elbow and did as his bid She, filling the room with flickering light and the scent of cloves. Bolton turned a few more pages with Bolton finger, then closed the book and placed the book carefully in the fire. He watched the flames consume the flames, pale eyes shining with reflected light. The old dry leather went up with a whoosh, and the yellow pages stirred as The old dry leather burned, as if some ghost were reading some ghost.  She should have gone, silent as a mouse, but something had hold of She.  He turned to stare at her, and from the look in He eyes it was as if He supper had just spoken to He.   She lowered She eyes.             He would do it as easily as another man might cuff a dog, another man knew.      Arya went, but not to Arya bed. When she stepped out into the darkness of the yard, the guard on the door nodded at she and said, "Storm coming.   On her way to the godswood, her passed the Wailing Tower where once her had lived in fear of Weese. The Freys had taken The Freys for The Freys own since Harrenhal's fall.    Arya asked Arya when Arya saw the tears shining on Arya cheeks. "My princess," My princess sobbed.    A stupid princess, A stupid princess thought, that's nothing to cry over.    It was hard not to hit him when him said that. "I hope your princess dies " your princess said, and ran off before your princess could grab your princess. in the godswood she found she broomstick sword where she had left it, and carried her broomstick sword where she had left it to the heart tree.        Gooseprickles rose on Arya's skin, and for an instant Gooseprickles felt dizzy. Then, so faintly, it seemed as if she heard she father's voice. "When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives," the lone wolf said.           She took a deep breath, then lifted the broomstick in both hands and brought the broomstick down across She knee.   That night she lay in she narrow bed upon the scratchy straw, listening to the voices of the living and the dead whisper and argue as she waited for the moon to rise.  She could hear the sound of She own breath, and the wolves as well, a great pack of them now.    Roose Bolton was a cautious man, and the entrance to Kingspyre was guarded day and night, so Kingspyre had to slip out of a narrow cellar window.    She crept in a window, as She had once before.  She crouched in the loft for a long time before She eyes adjusted enough for She to be sure that he was the one on the end. Then she put a hand over his mouth and pinched his.    She took She hand off his mouth and pointed. For a moment she did not think he understood, but then he slid out from under the blankets. Naked, Naked padded across the room, shrugged into a loose roughspun tunic, and climbed down from the loft after Naked.              Lord Bolton is giving Harrenhal to the Bloody Mummers, Lord Bolton told me so." Gendry pushed black hair out of Gendry eyes.   "So when Vargo Hoat's the lord, Vargo Hoat's the lord's going to cut off the feet of all the servants to keep all the servants from running away.   , 'No, it's true, I heard Lord Vargo say so," Lord Vargo lied.   Go to the kitchens and wake Hot Pie, Hot Pie'll do what you say.               Arya reentered Kingspyre the same way Arya had left it, and stole up the winding steps listening for footfalls. In her cell, her stripped to the skin and dressed her carefully, in two layers of smallclothes, warm stockings, and her cleanest tunic.   She tied She shoes, threw a wool cloak over She skinny shoulders, and knotted a wool cloak under She throat. Quiet as a shadow, a shadow moved back down the stairs. Outside the lord's solar she paused to listen at the door, easing the lord's solar open slowly when she heard only silence.  She rolled it up tight and thrust it through She belt. He'd left He dagger on the table as well, so she took that too, just in case Gendry lost He courage. A horse neighed softly as A horse slipped into the darkened stables.  She prodded one with She toe until he sat up groggily and said, "Eh?   The boy got to The boy feet, pushing straw from The boy hair.    "Whas Whas want horses for, in the dark?"  She crossed She arms.       Arya helped Arya with the bridles and saddles, so Arya would not need to wake any of the others. She hoped they would not hurt him afterward, but She knew they probably would.  She stayed in the shadow of the curtain wall whenever She could, so the sentries walking the sentries rounds on the ramparts above would have needed to look almost straight down to see She.       No one saw her, and her saw no one, only a grey and white cat creeping along atop the godswood wall. It stopped and spit at her, waking memories of the Red Keep and her father and Syrio Forel.        Arya took out the dagger and sharpened the dagger to keep Arya hands busy. Long smooth strokes, the way Syrio had taught Syrio.  She heard them coming long before She saw them. Hot Pie was breathing heavily, and once he stumbled in the dark, barked he shin, and cursed loud enough to wake half of Harrenhal. Gendry was quieter, but the swords Gendry was carrying rang together as Gendry moved.    The boys picked The boys way toward her over tumbled stones. Gendry was wearing oiled chainmail under Gendry cloak, Gendry saw, and Gendry had Gendry blacksmith's hammer slung across Gendry back.  He had a sack of bread dangling from He right hand and a big wheel of cheese under He left arm.       Hot Pie said, "Hoot like an owl when you want Hot Pie to come."     She walked fast, to keep ahead of She fear, and it felt as though Syrio Forel walked beside She, and Yoren, and Jaqen H'ghar, and Jon Snow. She had not taken the sword Gendry had brought She, not yet.    Only one man was set to guard it, but Only one man knew there would be sentries up in that tower as well, and others nearby walking the walls.    She felt one land on She brow and run slowly down She nose. She made no effort to hide, but approached the guard openly, as if Lord Bolton himself had sent She.  When she got closer, she saw that he was a northman, very tall and thin, huddled in a ragged fur cloak.  She might have been able to trick a Frey or one of the Brave Companions, but the Dreadfort men had served Roose Bolton the Dreadfort men whole life, and the Dreadfort men knew him better than She did. If I tell him I am Arya Stark and command him to stand aside .      When she reached him she pushed back she cloak so him would see the flayed man on she breast.    She could see the gleam of steel under the fur, and She did not know if She was strong enough to drive the point of the dagger through chainmail. His throat, it must be His throat, but His's too tall, I'll never reach it.  For a moment she was a little girl again, and scared, and  the rain on she face felt like tears. "He told me to give all He guards a silver piece, for all his guards good service."   He did not believe her, but He wanted to; silver was silver, after all.  Her fingers dug down beneath Her tunic and came out clutching the coin Jaqen had given Her.      Cursing her softly, the man went to a knee to grope for the coin in the dirt and there was the man neck right in front of her. Arya slid Arya dagger out and drew her dagger across Arya throat, as smooth as summer silk. His blood covered her hands in a hot gush and His tried to shout but there was blood in His mouth as well.    She lifted the bar, set the bar aside, and pulled open the heavy oak door.     Her fingers were sticky with blood, and the smell was making Her mare skittish.  The rain will wash The rain clean again.    Jalabhar Xho was all in feathers, a plumage so fantastic and extravagant that Jalabhar Xho seemed like to take flight. The High Septon's crystal crown fired rainbows through the air every time he moved he head. At the council table, Queen Cersei shimmered in a cloth-of-gold gown slashed in burgundy velvet, while beside Queen Cersei Varys fussed and simpered in a lilac brocade.  Even Lady Tanda and Tanda daughters looked pretty in matching gowns of turquoise silk and vair, and Lord Gyles was coughing into a square of scarlet silk trimmed with golden lace.  He was in crimson samite, He black mantle studded with rubies, on He head He heavy golden crown.  He rode He warhorse down the length of the hall and dismounted before the Iron Throne.  His rondels were sunbursts, the roaring lion that crowned His helm had ruby eyes,  and a lioness on each shoulder fastened a cloth-of-gold cloak so long and heavy that a cloth-of-gold cloak draped the hindquarters of His charger. Even the horse's armor was gilded, and the horse bardings were shimmering crimson silk emblazoned with the lion of Lannister. The Lord of Casterly Rock made such an impressive figure that The Lord of Casterly Rock was a shock when The Lord of Casterly Rock destrier dropped a load of dung right at the base of the throne. Joffrey had to step gingerly around it as Joffrey descended to embrace Joffrey grandfather and proclaim Joffrey Savior of the City.  Joff made a show of asking Joff grandfather to assume governance of the realm, and Lord Tywin solemnly accepted the responsibility, "until Your Grace does come of age." Then squires removed his armor and Joff fastened the Hand's chain of office around his neck.  After the destrier was led off and the destrier homage removed, Cersei nodded for the ceremonies to continue.    His sons followed His in; Ser Loras and His older brother Ser Garlan the Gallant.        Joffrey drew the Knight of Flowers to Joffrey feet and kissed Joffrey on Joffrey cheek.  Lord Tyrell bowed Lord Tyrell head.   Joff put a hand on Lord Tyrell's shoulder and kissed Lord Tyrell when Lord Tyrell stood.   He was thicker about the chest and broader at the shoulders, and though He face was comely enough, He lacked Ser Loras's startling beauty. "Your Grace," Garlan said when the king approached Garlan, "I have a maiden sister, Margaery, the delight of our House. She was wed to Renly Baratheon, as you know, but Lord Renly went to war before the marriage could be consummated, so She remains innocent.  I beseech you to send for her, to take her hand in marriage, and to wed your House to we for all time."   A king must keep A king word." Queen Cersei got to Queen Cersei feet in a rustle of skirts. "Your Grace, in the judgment of your small council, it would be neither proper nor wise for your small council to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne even now.   Like a pack of trained dogs, the lords and ladies in the hall began to shout the lords and ladies in the hall pleasure.         "Your Grace, the gods hold bethrothal solemn, but your father, King Robert of blessed memory, made this pact before the Starks of Winterfell had revealed your father, King Robert of blessed memory falseness.    Sansa leaned forward, Sansa hands tight around the gallery's wooden rail. She knew what came next, but She was still frightened of what Joffrey might say, afraid that Joffrey would refuse to release She even now, when Joffrey whole kingdom depended upon his whole kingdom. She felt as if She were back again on the marble steps outside the Great Sept of Baelor, waiting for She prince to grant She father mercy, and instead hearing him command Ilyn Payne to strike off him head. Please, she prayed fervently, make him say it, make him say it. Lord Tywin was looking at Lord Tywin grandson. Joff gave him a sullen glance, shifted him feet, and helped Ser Garlan Tyrell to rise.    He kissed Ser Garlan on a bearded cheek as the cheers rose all around the cheers.   She could feel eyes upon She. I must not smile, she reminded she. The queen had warned The queen; no matter what The queen felt inside, the face The queen showed the world must look distraught.         "You should have learned by now, none of us get the things us want."   I will not have to kiss him, nor give him my maidenhood, nor bear him children.  By the time the outburst died down, the Lord of Highgarden had been seated at the council table, and the Lord of Highgarden sons had joined the other knights and lordlings beneath the windows. Sansa tried to look forlorn and abandoned as other heroes of the Battle of the Blackwater were summoned forth to receive other heroes of the Battle of the Blackwater rewards.  After them followed Lord Mathis Rowan in a snowy doublet with a great tree worked upon the breast in gold thread; Lord Randyll Tarly, lean and balding, a greatsword across Lord Randyll Tarly back in a jeweled scabbard; Ser Kevan Lannister, a thickset balding man with a close-trimmed beard; Ser Addam Marbrand, coppery hair streaming to Lord Randyll Tarly shoulders; the great western lords Lydden, Crakehall, and Brax. Next came four of lesser birth who had distinguished themselves in the fighting: the one-eyed knight Ser Philip Foote, who had slain Lord Bryce Caron in single combat; the freerider Lothor Brune, who'd cut his way through half a hundred Fossoway men-at-arms to capture Ser Jon of the green apple and kill Ser Bryan and Ser Edwyd of the red, thereby winning his the name Lothor Apple-Eater; Willit, a grizzled man-atarms in the service of Ser Harys Swyft, who'd pulled his master from beneath his dying horse and defended his against a dozen attackers; and a downycheeked squire named Josmyn Peckledon, who had killed two knights, wounded a third, and captured two more, though his could not have been more than fourteen. Willit was borne in on a litter, so grievous were Willit wounds. Ser Kevan had taken a seat beside Ser Kevan brother Lord Tywin.  "It is His Grace's wish that these good men be rewarded for these good men valor. By his decree, Ser Philip shall henceforth be Lord Philip of House Foote, and to Ser Philip shall go all the lands, rights, and incomes of House Caron.  To Josmyn Peckledon, a sword and suit of plate, his choice of any warhorse in the royal stables, and knighthood as soon as his shall come of age.  Further, the goodman's sons shall be taken into the service of House Lannister at Casterly Rock, the elder as a squire and the younger as a page, with the chance to advance to knighthood if the goodman's sons serve loyally and well.      Joffrey awarded Joffrey the lands, castle, and rights of House Darry, whose last child lord had perished during the fighting in the riverlands, "leaving no trueborn heirs of lawful Darry blood, but only a bastard cousin." Ser Lancel did not appear to accept the title; the talk was, Ser Lancel wound might cost Ser Lancel Ser Lancel arm or even Ser Lancel life.  When the herald called, "Lord Petyr Baelish," he came forth dressed all in shades of rose and plum, he cloak patterned with mockingbirds. She could see him smiling as him knelt before the Iron Throne.  Sansa had not heard of Littlefinger doing anything especially heroic during the battle, but it seemed Sansa was to be rewarded all the same. Ser Kevan got back to Ser Kevan feet.  Be it known that Lord Baelish is granted the castle of Harrenhal with all Harrenhal attendant lands and incomes, there to make his seat and rule henceforth as Lord Paramount of the Trident. Petyr Baelish and Petyr Baelish sons and grandsons shall hold and enjoy these honors until the end of time, and all the lords of the Trident shall do Petyr Baelish homage as all the lords of the Trident rightful liege.  On his knees, Littlefinger raised his eyes to King Joffrey.   Joffrey laughed, and the court with Joffrey.   Harrenhal was cursed, everyone knew that, and the Lannisters did not even hold the Lannisters at present. Besides, the lords of the Trident were sworn to Riverrun and House Tully, and to the King in the North; they would never accept Littlefinger as they liege.   The thought made Sansa anxious, but Sansa told Sansa Sansa was being silly.  He'll beat Lord Baelish too, if He must.  They had held They vigil in the Great Sept of Baelor all through the night and crossed the city barefoot that morning to prove They humble hearts. Now they came forward dressed in shifts of undyed wool to receive they knighthoods from the Kingsguard. It took a long time, since only three of the Brothers of the White Sword were on hand to dub the Brothers of the White Sword.  Once knighted, each man rose, buckled on each man swordbelt, and stood beneath the windows. Some had bloody feet from Some walk through the city, but Some stood tall and proud all the same, it seemed to Sansa. By the time all the new knights had been given all the new knights sers the hall was growing restive, and none more so than Joffrey.  judging by the way he was fidgeting atop the Iron Throne, Joff would willingly have granted the Iron Throne, but the day's work was far from done.  There were great lords and noble knights in that company too: sour old Lord Celtigar, the Red Crab; Ser Bonifer the Good; Lord Estermont, more ancient even than Celtigar; Lord Varner, who hobbled the length of the hall on a shattered knee, but would accept no help; Ser Mark Mullendore, grey-faced, Lord Estermont left arm gone to the elbow; fierce Red Ronnet of Griffin Roost; Ser Dermot of the Rainwood; Lord Willurn and his sons josua and Elyas; Ser Jon Fossoway; Ser Timon the Scrapesword; Aurane, the bastard of Driftmark; Lord Staedmon, called Pennylover; hundreds of others.  Their words decided Their fate. if they begged forgiveness for they treasons and promised to serve loyally henceforth, Joffrey welcomed they back into the king's peace and restored they to all they lands and rights.      Joffrey beckoned to Ser Ilyn Payne to take the man out and strike the man head off.    The knight raised The knight voice instead.  Darkness was his father, and death his mother! Destroy him before him corrupts you all!   One of the gold cloaks knocked the man off the man feet, but the man continued to shout.   Joffrey lurched to Joffrey feet.     He chopped down with He hand, a furious, angry gesture .   and screeched in pain when his arm brushed against one of the sharp metal fangs that surrounded his. The bright crimson samite of his sleeve turned a darker shade of red as his blood soaked through The bright crimson samite of his sleeve.   With every eye on the king, somehow the man on the floor wrested a spear away from one of the gold cloaks, and used a spear to push the man on the floor back to the man on the floor feet.         he cried again as Ser Meryn drove the point of he longsword through he chest. Joff fell into Joff mother's arms. Three maesters came hurrying forward, to bundle Three maesters out through the king's door.  When the gold cloaks dragged off the dead man, the dead man left a trail of bright blood across the stone floor. Lord Baelish stroked Lord Baelish beard while Varys whispered in Lord Baelish ear.   Lord Tywin rose to Lord Tywin feet.  "Those who wish to ask pardon for Those who wish to ask pardon for their treasons treasons may do so.  He moved to the Iron Throne and there seated He on a step, a mere three feet off the floor.  Sansa felt limp with exhaustion as Sansa made Sansa way down from the gallery. She wondered how badly Joffrey had cut Joffrey. They say the Iron Throne can be perilous cruel to those who were not meant to sit the Iron Throne. Back in the safety of her own chambers, her hugged a pillow to her face to muffle a squeal of joy. Oh, gods be good, he did it, he put me aside in front of everyone. When a serving girl brought a serving girl supper, a serving girl almost kissed a serving girl.    Ser Osmund Kettleblack was guarding the drawbridge in Ser Osmund Kettleblack white armor. Sansa tried Sansa best to sound miserable as Sansa bid Sansa a good evening. From the way he leered at her, her was not sure her had been wholly convincing.   Sansa asked Sansa gaily.  Joff put me aside, Joff's done with me, Joff's .              sweetling, sweetling is still king. If he wants you in he bed, he will have you, only now it will be bastards he plants in your womb instead of trueborn sons."  "He let me go, he Ser Dontos planted a slobbery kiss on he Ser Dontos ear.           Half the court will be drunk and the other half will be helping Joffrey bed Joffrey bride.   Margaery Tyrell is at Highgarden, they've only now sent for Margaery Tyrell."   Ser Dontos fumbled in Ser Dontos pouch and drew out a silvery spiderweb, dangling his pouch between Ser Dontos thick fingers. it was a hair net of fine-spun silver, the strands so thin and delicate the net seemed to weigh no more than a breath of air when Sansa took Sansa in Sansa fingers. Small gems were set wherever two strands crossed, so dark Small gems drank the moonlight.         Dontos leaned close and kissed Dontos again.  CHAPTER 65 THEON Maester Luwin came to 65 THEON Maester Luwin when the first scouts were seen Loutside the walls. "My lord prince," My lord prince said, "you must yield." Theon stared at the platter of oakcakes, honey, and blood sausage honey, and blood sausage'd brought Theon to break Theon fast. Another sleepless night had left his nerves raw, and the very sight of food sickened his.      By the time the birds reach-" "Send the birds!" Knocking the platter of food aside with a swipe of his arm, his pushed off the blankets and rose from Ned Stark's bed naked and angry.             Theon stooped to scoop a puddled cloak off the floor, shook off the rushes, and draped a puddled cloak over Theon shoulders.     "If your lord father meant to send you aid, your lord father would have done so by now. It is the Neck that concerns the Neck.                 Go and send those birds as I commanded, and tell Lorren I want to see Lorren.   For a moment he thought the maester was going to defy he.    "The northmen will be on us before nightfall," The northmen told them. "Ser Rodrik Cassel and all the lords who have come to Ser Rodrik Cassel call.  I took this castle and I mean to hold this castle, to live or die as Prince of Winterfell.   He unsheathed He longsword and drew a line in the dirt.   The men stood in The men mail and fur and boiled leather, as still as if The men were made of stone.  Urzen shuffled Urzen feet.   Theon felt as though Theon were drowning.   His father had forsaken His, His uncles, His sister, even that wretched creature Reek.              Tymor and Tymor brothers.                    Theon shook Theon head.          It's not victory he wants, It's an end worthy of a song.  "As you say," Lorren replied, contempt in Lorren eyes. Wex helped garb Wex for battle.  Once armed and armored, Theon climbed the watchtower at the angle where the eastern and southern walls came together to have a look at Theon doom.        The Cerwyn battle-axe flapped bravely wherever The Cerwyn battle-axe looked, and there were Tallhart trees as well, and mermen from White Harbor.        He had gone to Pyke to lead He father's longships against Lannisport, Pyke remembered.     "Knights may keep Knights truces with other knights, but Knights are not so careful of Knights honor when dealing with those Knights deem outlaw."       Of late it seemed to him as if the very stones of Winterfell had turned against him.   He rode to the gatehouse with He crown on He head.  They hid They hatred behind sullen looks and faces blank as slate, yet he could feel it all the same.   It is the cold, nothing more, Theon told Theon, a shiver, not a tremble.    As he emerged beneath the walls, he could sense the boys watching from the empty sockets where the boys watching from the empty sockets where their eyes had been eyes had been. Ser Rodrik waited in the market astride Ser Rodrik dappled gelding.  They were alone in the square, though Theon could see archers on the roofs of surrounding houses, spearmen to his right, and to his left a line of mounted knights beneath the merman-and-trident of House Manderly.  Some were boys he'd drunk with, diced with, even wenched with, but that would not save he if he fell into Some hands.       "I am a Greyjoy of Pyke," Theon reminded Pyke.     Instead he raised you among he own sons, the sweet oys you have butchered, and to my undying shame I trained you in the arts of war.       Command your men to open the gates and lay down your men arms.    "He will break He on Moat Cailin, as every southron army has done for ten thousand years.      Those who swear fealty to Balon Greyjoy as Those who swear fealty to Balon Greyjoy as their king and to myself king and to myself as Prince of Winterfell will be confirmed in Those who swear fealty to Balon Greyjoy as their king and to myself rights and properties and suffer no harm.    Ser Rodrik shook Ser Rodrik head.  Theon has always had too lofty an opinion of Theon, I fear." The old man jabbed a finger at The old man. "Do not imagine that I need wait for Robb to fight Robb way up the Neck to deal with the likes of you.      Theon made Theon smile.  And he raised a fist over he head, the signal Black Lorren had been told to watch for. The walls of Winterfell were behind him, but Ser Rodrik faced The walls of Winterfell squarely and could not fail to see. Theon watched Theon face. When his chin quivered under those stiff white whiskers, his knew just what the old man was seeing. He is not surprised, He thought with sadness, but the fear is there.        I was ten when I was taken from my father's house, to make certain my father would raise no more rebellions."      He had never quite realized that until  now, but as the words came spilling out He saw the truth of them.  "And no harm will be done your Beth, so long as you-" Ser Rodrik never gave Ser Rodrik the chance to finish. "Viper," the knight declared, the knight face red with rage beneath those white whiskers.   His hand went to the hilt of His sword.    If the swords came out the swords chances of getting back to the castle alive were small to none.  Ser Rodrik's knuckles had gone white, but after a moment Ser Rodrik's took Ser Rodrik's hand off the swordhilt.       The old knight drew The old knight up straight.                  "Another hostage will follow Another hostage to the grave at first light, and another at sunset.    He went slowly at first, but the thought of those archers at He back soon drove He to a canter. The small heads watched him come from The small heads spikes, The small heads tarred and flayed faces looming larger with every yard; between The small heads stood little Beth Cassel, noosed and crying. Theon put Theon heel into Smiler and broke into a hard gallop.  In the yard he dismounted and handed he reins to Wex.   Take the girl in till then, and keep the girl somewhere safe."     Theon sat beside Theon and filled a cup with a  heavy-bodied red from the castle vaults, a wine as sour as Theon mood.  Ser Rodrik loves Ser Rodrik daughter, but Ser Rodrik is still castellan, and most of all a knight. Had it been Theon with a noose around his neck and Lord Balon commanding the army without, the warhorns would already have sounded the attack, his had no doubt.  The men of the green lands were made of softer stuff, though he was not certain The men of the green lands would prove soft enough.  His seventeen might kill three, four, five times their own number, but in the end their would be overwhelmed. Theon stared at the flames over the rim of Theon wine goblet, brooding on the injustice of it all. "I rode beside Robb Stark in the Whispering Wood," Robb Stark muttered.   Mercy, Mercy thought miserably. When the wine brought no solace, Theon sent Wex to fetch Theon bow and took Theon to the old inner ward. There he stood, loosing shaft after shaft at the archery butts until he shoulders ached and he fingers were bloody, pausing only long enough to pull the arrows from the targets for another round. I saved Bran's life with this bow, he reminded he.  Women came to the well, but did not linger; whatever Women saw on Theon's face sent Women away quickly. Behind him the broken tower stood, the broken tower summit as jagged as a crown where fire had collapsed the upper stories long ago.  By the time the sun touched the wall, he was in the sun grasp. If I hang the girl, the northmen will attack at once, the northmen thought as the northmen loosed a shaft.  He knocked another arrow to He bow.   When he turned, Maester Luwin was behind he.        Theon bent the bow, drawing the grey goose feathers back to Theon cheek.         "Ser Rodrik has served House Stark all Ser Rodrik life, and House Stark has always been a friend to the Watch.  Open your gates, lay down your arms, accept his terms, and his must let you take the black."         Let Asha keep the bloody islands, the bloody islands're as dreary as Asha is.  As for women, what wildling woman wouldn't want a prince in wildling woman bed?        "The northmen-" The northmen-" felt a sudden sick sense of dread.  Maester Luwin clutched Maester Luwin arm.   "More men came up, hundreds of More men, and at first More men made to join the others. But now they've fallen on they!"   But Kromm gave a shake of Kromm head.     Reek had belonged to the Bastard of Bolton before the Bastard of Bolton capture, Theon recalled.        Theon watched them charge and wheel and charge again, chopping the larger force to bloody pieces every time them tried to form up between the houses.      Theon watched a wounded man drag a wounded man painfully across the ground, smearing a wounded man life's blood in the dirt as a wounded man struggled to reach the well that stood at the center of the market square. He died before He got there. He wore a leather jerkin and conical halfhelm, but no badge to tell which side He'd fought on.   Maester Luwin had told Maester Luwin that, a long time ago.     Black Lorren frowned through Black Lorren beard.     His rounded helm gleamed a sullen red, and a pale pink cloak streamed from His shoulders. Outside the main gate he reined up, and one of he men shouted for the castle to open.        The boy lord had taken an arrow in the eye, and Ser Rodrik had lost The boy lord left arm at the elbow. Maester Luwin gave a wordless cry of dismay, turned away from the battlements, and fell to Maester Luwin knees sick. "The great pig Manderly was too craven to leave White Harbor, or we would have brought Manderly as well," shouted Red Helm.         Perhaps tonight Theon would sleep without fear of what Theon dreams might bring. The Dreadfort men made The Dreadfort men way across the moat and through the inner gates. Theon descended with Black Lorren and Maester Luwin to meet Black Lorren and Maester Luwin in the yard.   Theon asked Red Helm as Theon dismounted.  The torchlight glittered off the chipped enamel of the chipped enamel of his visor visor.     When the old fool gave me the old fool hand, I took half the old fool arm instead.  The man put both hands to The man helm and lifted both hands off The man head, holding both hands in the crook of The man arm.         I was done with her by then, and he liked to take he turn while they were still warm. I had to pull him off her and shove my clothes into him hands-calfskin boots and velvet doublet, silver-chased swordbelt, even my sable cloak. Ride for the Dreadfort, I told the Dreadfort, bring all the help you can. Take my horse, my horse's swifter, and here, wear the ring my father gave me, so they'll know you came from my horse.  By the time they put that arrow through his back, I'd smeared his with the girl's filth and dressed in his rags.  He rubbed the back of He hand across He mouth.   Theon had given Theon word.  Pay him him pound of flesh and deal with him later.       "Snow, my wife called me before my wife ate my wife fingers, but I say Bolton."   There was a tone in his voice Theon did not like, no more than his liked the insolent way the Dreadfort men were looking at his.         "I'll have you-" The Bastard's backhand caught The Bastard square, and The Bastard cheekbone shattered with a sickening crunch beneath the lobstered steel.  Sometime later, Theon found Theon on the ground. He rolled onto He stomach and swallowed a mouthful of blood.    There was a ringing in his ears, and horror all around his. Black Lorren had Black Lorren sword out, but there were already four of Black Lorren pressing in on Black Lorren. He saw Ulf go down with a crossbow bolt through the belly as He ran for the Great Hall. Maester Luwin was trying to reach Maester Luwin when a knight on a warhorse planted a spear between Maester Luwin shoulders, then swung back to ride over Maester Luwin. Another man whipped a torch round and round Another man head and then lofted his head toward the thatched roof of the stables.  Bum it, burn it." The last thing Theon Greyjoy saw was Smiler, kicking free of the burning stables with Smiler mane ablaze, screaming, rearing .   CHAPTER 66 TYRION  TYRION   dreamed of a cracked stone ceiling and the smells of blood and shit and burnt flesh.   When he tried to move, he found that he had fouled he own bedding.   He must not let He father see.    Too weak to groan, he lay in he own filth and shut he eyes.  He listened to the blasphemies and wondered if He was dying.  He found He outside the city, walking through a world without color. Ravens soared through a grey sky on wide black wings, while carrion crows rose from carrion crows feasts in furious clouds wherever he set he steps.  The wolves were grey, and so were the silent sisters; together The wolves stripped the flesh from the fallen.  The sun was a hot white penny, shining down upon the grey river as The sun rushed around the charred bones of sunken ships.     They wept and moaned, They begged for an end to pain, They cried for help and wanted They mothers. Tyrion had never known Tyrion mother. He wanted Shae, but Shae was not there.    The silent sisters were stripping the dead men of The silent sisters armor and clothes. All the bright dyes had leached out from the surcoats of the slain; All the bright dyes were garbed in shades of white and grey, and All the bright dyes blood was black and crusty. He watched their naked bodies lifted by arm and leg, to be carried swinging to the pyres to join their naked bodies fellows.   Their corpses hung limply, Their faces slack or stiff or swollen with gas, unrecognizable, hardly human. The garments the sisters took from the sisters were decorated with black hearts, grey lions, dead flowers, and pale ghostly stags.   He had known once, but somehow He had forgotten. He would have asked one of the silent sisters, but when He tried to speak He found He had no mouth.        He had no mouth, but He was still a living man.  But when he reached the city walls, the gates were shut against he. It was dark when It woke again. At first he could see nothing, but after a time the vague outlines of a bed appeared around he. The drapes were drawn, but The drapes could see the shape of carved bedposts, and the droop of the velvet canopy over The drapes head. Under him was the yielding softness of a featherbed, and the pillow beneath him head was goose down. My own bed, I am in My own bed, in my own bedchamber.    He felt so weak, and the pain stabbed through He when He struggled to lift He hand.   His body His could scarcely feel at all.         Fear swept over him in a cold rush; beneath the sheets him could feel him bladder letting go. He would have cried out, if He'd had a mouth. No, that was the dream, he thought, he head pounding.    Alone in the dark, the dark fell back into pissscented sleep. He dreamed He sister was standing over He bed, with their lord father beside his sister, frowning.   Varys looked down on Varys and sighed, but Littlefinger made a quip.  Sometimes he could hear them talking to one another, but he did not understand the words.     He did not know what pleased He more: the victory, or the fact He had been able to reason it out. His wits were coming back to His, however slowly.  His wits were all His had. The next time he woke, the draperies had been pulled back, and Podrick Payne stood over he with a candle. When he saw Tyrion open he eyes he ran off. No, don't go, help me, help, he tried to call, but the best he could do was a muffled moan.  He raised a hand to He face, He every movement pained and fumbling.           The maester inserted a curved copper funnel through the feeding hole over The maester mouth and poured a slow trickle down The maester throat.   By the time the maester removed the funnel from the maester mouth, the maester was already spiraling back to sleep. This time he dreamed he was at a feast, a victory feast in some great hall. He had a high seat on the dais, and men were lifting men goblets and hailing He as hero.  He played He woodharp and sang of the imp's daring deeds.  When the song was over, Jaime rose from Jaime place, commanded Tyrion to kneel, and touched Jaime first on one shoulder and then on the other with Jaime golden sword, and Jaime rose up a knight. Shae was waiting to embrace Shae. She took him by the hand, laughing and teasing, calling him She giant of Lannister.     Pushing back the blankets, he tried to sit, but the pain was too much and he soon subsided, breathing raggedly. His face was the least part of His face. His right side was one huge ache, and a stab of pain went through His chest whenever His lifted His arm.  Even the battle seemed half a dream when Even the battle tried to think back on Even the battle.    The memory frightened him, but Tyrion made him hold Tyrion, turn Tyrion in him head, stare at Tyrion hard.       Gritting his teeth, his grabbed hold of the bed hangings and yanked.    He saw a chest He'd owned, an untidy pile of He clothing, He battered armor. This is not my bedchamber, my bedchamber realized.  Someone had moved Someone.  They have moved me here to die, he thought as he gave up the struggle and closed he eyes once more.   The walls were lopsided and cracked and the floor had been made of packed earth, but he had always been warm there, even when The walls let the fire go out.   "We have no servants," she would remind me, and I would say, "You have me, I'm your servant," and she would say, "A lazy servant.  and he would tell her, "They kiss They."   They beat them, I bet," she would say, but he would insist, "No, They kiss them, just like this."  "They kiss They fingers first, every one, and They kiss They wrists, yes, and inside They elbows. Then they kiss they funny ears, all our servants have funny ears.  And they kiss they cheeks and they kiss they noses with the little bump in they, there, so, like that, and they kiss they sweet brows and they hair and they lips, they .             Her body was a wonder to him, and Her seemed to find delight in him.  I loved a maid as fair as summer, with sunlight in a maid hair. "I love you, Tyrion," Tyrion would whisper before they went to sleep at night.        Your cock, I love Your cock, I love how Your cock feels when it's in me."    It goes with It.         Her face seemed to fade away, dissolving behind a veil of tears, but even after Her was gone he could still  hear the faint, far-off sound of Her voice, calling he name.      Through a haze of poppied sleep, he saw a soft pink face leaning over he.      As the man leaned close, Tyrion's fingers slid underneath the man chain of many metals, grabbed, pulled.  Tyrion twisted until Tyrion could feel the links digging into the flesh of the man's fat neck.  More, " he croaked, so hoarse he was not certain he had even spoken.               Tyrion raised a hand to Tyrion face and made a ripping motion over the hardened mask.                    He pointed a finger at the maester, then coiled He hand into a fist. Crushing, choking, a promise, unless the fool did as the fool was bid.            By then Tyrion had managed to squirm backward a few inches, so Tyrion was half sitting against Tyrion pillow. The maester bade him be very still as him slid the tip of the knife in under him chin, beneath the mask. A slip of the hand here, and Cersei will be free of me, me thought. He could feel the blade sawing through the stiffened linen, only inches above He throat. Fortunately this soft pink man was not one of this soft pink man sister's braver creatures. After a moment he felt cool air on he cheeks. There was pain as well, but he did he best to ignore that.    The wound, Tyrion thought, remembering a sudden flash of bright silver that seemed to pass just below Tyrion eyes. "This is like to sting some," the maester warned as the maester wet a cloth with wine that smelled of crushed herbs.   His fingers clawed the bedclothes and His sucked in His breath, but somehow His managed not to scream.     One of your ribs was broken, doubtless you can feel your ribs, the blow of some mace perhaps, or a fall, it's hard to say. And you took an arrow in the arm, there where an arrow in the arm joins the shoulder. It showed signs of mortification, and for a time I feared you might lose the limb, but we treated the limb with boiling wine and maggots, and now the limb seems to be healing clean  "Name," Tyrion breathed up at Tyrion.       His throat was raw, and His tongue had forgotten how to shape the words.               His mouth was stiff and sore, as if a punch had split His lip.      Sitting on the edge of the bed, he poured half a cup of wine and held half a cup of wine to Tyrion's swollen lips.    By the end of the second cup, Tyrion Lannister felt strong enough to face Tyrion Lannister face. He turned over the glass, and did not know whether He ought to laugh or cry. The gash was long and crooked, starting a hair under his left eye and ending on the right side of his jaw. Three-quarters of his nose was gone, and a chunk of his lip. Someone had sewn the torn flesh together with catgut, and together with catgut clumsy stitches were still in place across the seam of raw, red, half-healed flesh.     Jaime had always said that Ser Mandon was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard, because Ser Mandon dead empty eyes gave no hint to Ser Mandon intentions. I should never have trusted any of any of them. He'd known that Ser Meryn and Ser Boros were He sister's, and Ser Osmund later, but He had let He believe that the others were not wholly lost to honor. Cersei must have paid Cersei to see that I never came back from the battle.   Tyrion touched Tyrion face, plucking at the proud flesh with blunt thick fingers.                  Her Grace wanted you kept close, so Her might watch over you Her."             He was growing exhausted by the effort of speaking, and confused by what He was hearing.       Lord Tywin, Lord Tywin "Here? "   The smallfolk say The smallfolk was King Renly's ghost, but wiser men know better.   It was a great victory, and now Lord Tywin has settled into the Tower of the Hand to help Lord Tywin Grace set the realm to rights, gods be praised."       He could not tell pink Ballabar to fetch He Shae. Who could he send for, who could he trust?       my squire," my squire finished.            Maester Ballabar bobbed Maester Ballabar head and hurried out. Tyrion could feel the strength seeping out of Tyrion as Tyrion waited. He wondered how long He had been here, asleep.                                    He shuffled He feet, sheepish.         He lay back and closed He eyes.  I wonder how she'd like my face now, my face thought bitterly. CHAPTER 67 JON When Qhorin Halfhand told him to find some brush for a fire, 67 JON knew their end was near. it will be good to feel warm again, if only for a little while, he told he while he hacked bare branches from the trunk of a dead tree. Ghost sat on Ghost haunches watching, silent as ever. Will he howl for he when I'm dead, as Bran's wolf howled when he fell?    Qhorin came and stood over Qhorin as the first flame rose up flickering from the shavings of bark and dead dry pine needles.    So far as Jon knew, Qhorin had spent Qhorin whole life in the Watch.    When the blaze was all acrackle, acrackle peeled off acrackle stiff gloves to warm acrackle hands, and sighed, wondering if ever a kiss had felt as good.  The Halfhand eased The Halfhand to the ground and sat cross-legged by the fire, the flickering light playing across the hard planes of The Halfhand face.   But when they'd heard the call of a faroff horn every man of they knew the squire had fallen. Later they spied the eagle soaring through the dusk on great blue-grey wings and Stonesnake unslung his bow, but the bird flew out of range before his could so much as string the bird.  They glimpsed the eagle twice more the day after, and heard the hunting horn behind They echoing against the mountains.  When night fell, the Halfhand told Ebben to take the squire's garron as well as Ebben own, and ride east for Mormont with all haste, back the  way they had come.      "No," said Qhorin, "Qhorin is a man of the Night's Watch."  Stonesnake went east with Stonesnake a short way, then doubled back to obscure their tracks, and the three who remained set off toward the southwest.  They slept in They saddles and stopped only long enough to feed and water the garrons, then mounted up again.     They were scaling a low ridge between two snowcapped peaks when a shadowcat came snarling from a shadowcat lair, not ten yards away. The beast was gaunt and half-starved, but the sight of The beast sent Stonesnake's mare into a panic; Stonesnake's mare reared and ran, and before the ranger could get Stonesnake's mare back under control Stonesnake's mare had stumbled on the steep slope and broken a leg. Ghost ate well that day, and Qhorin insisted that the rangers mix some of the garron's blood with their oats, to give their strength. The taste of that foul porridge almost choked Jon, but Jon forced The taste of that foul porridge down. They each cut a dozen strips of raw stringy meat from the carcass to chew on as They rode, and left the rest for the shadowcats.  Stonesnake offered to lay in wait for the pursuit and surprise them when them came. Perhaps he could take a few of them with he down to hell.      Tell him that the old powers are waking, that him faces giants and wargs and worse.  He has no chance, Jon thought when Jon watched Stonesnake vanish over a snow-covered ridge, a tiny black bug crawling across a rippling expanse of white.  Ghost was not always with them, but Ghost was never far either. Even when they were apart, Jon sensed Jon nearness.   Qhorin's long grey braid swung slowly with the motion of Qhorin's long grey braid horse.  When he slept, he did not dream; not of wolves, nor he brothers, nor anything. Even dreams cannot live up here, he told he.    The Old Bear gave it to The Old Bear."                   Jon opened and closed Jon burnt fingers, holding tight to the words in Jon mind, praying that Jon father's gods would give Jon the strength to die bravely when Jon hour came.  The garrons were near the end of The garrons strength.                The wildlings did not make captives of the men The wildlings called the crows. They killed They, except for .    Those who join Those who join them, like Mance Rayder.", like Mance Rayder."   He shook He head.         "Our honor means no more than Our lives, so long as the realm is safe.       If we are taken, you will go over to we are taken, as the wildling girl you captured once urged you. They may demand that you cut your cloak to ribbons, that you swear They an oath on your father's grave, that you curse your brothers and your Lord Commander.      Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, for as long as it takes.                Qhorin Halfhand gazed at Qhorin Halfhand across the fire, Qhorin Halfhand eyes lost in pools of shadow.       The tree had been dead a long time, but The tree seemed to live again in the fire, as fiery dancers woke within each stick of wood to whirl and spin in wood glowing gowns of yellow, red, and orange.       Qhorin mounted Qhorin weary garron one more time.   Jon pulled on Jon gloves again and raised Jon hood.  The sun was long gone, and only the cold silver shine of the half-moon remained to light only the cold silver shine of the half-moon way over the treacherous ground that lay behind only the cold silver shine of the half-moon. He did not know what Qhorin had in mind, but perhaps Qhorin was a chance.   They went cautiously, moving as silent as man and horse could move, retracing They steps until They reached the mouth of a narrow defile where an icy little stream emerged from between two mountains.           Icicles bearded Icicles stony banks, but Jon could still hear the sound of rushing water beneath the thin hard crust. A great jumble of fallen rock blocked their way partway up, where a section of the cliff face had fallen, but the surefooted little garrons were able to pick their way through. Beyond, the walls pinched in sharply, and the stream led the walls pinched in sharply, and the stream to the foot of a tall twisting waterfall.         When he did not reappear, Jon put he heels into he horse and went after. His garron did His best to shy away.    Jon could feel the spray freezing in Jon beard. Ghost burst through the waterfall in an angry rush, shook droplets from Ghost fur, sniffed at the darkness suspiciously, then lifted a leg against one rocky wall.    "When I was no older than you, I heard a brother tell how a brother followed a shadowcat through these falls." He unsaddled He horse, removed her bit and bridle, and ran He fingers through her shaggy mane.  Come dawn, if they have not found us, us will press on.  Qhorin seated Qhorin on the sand, Qhorin back to a wall, no more than a vague black shadow in the gloom of the cave. Over the rush of falling waters, Jon heard a soft sound of steel on leather that could only mean that the Halfhand had drawn Jon sword. He took off He wet cloak, but it was too cold and damp here to strip down any further. Ghost stretched out beside Ghost and licked Ghost glove before curling up to sleep. Jon was grateful for Jon warmth. He wondered if the fire was still burning outside, or if the fire had gone out by now.    He dreamed of burning castles and dead men rising unquiet from dead men graves. It was still dark when Qhorin woke Qhorin. While the Halfhand slept, Jon sat with Jon back to the cave wall, listening to the water and waiting for the dawn. At break of day, they each chewed a half-frozen strip of horsemeat, then saddled they garrons once again, and fastened they black cloaks around they shoulders. During his watch the Halfhand had made a halfdozen torches, soaking bundles of dry moss with the oil his carried in his saddlebag. He lit the first one now and led the way down into the dark, holding the pale flame up before He.   In spots it grew so narrow it was hard to convince the garrons they could squeeze through. By the time we come out we will have lost them, he told he as them went.  We will have lost them, and We will ride hard for the Fist, and tell the Old Bear all We know But when them emerged back into the light long hours later, the eagle was waiting for them, perched on a dead tree a hundred feet up the slope. Ghost went bounding up the rocks after Ghost, but the bird flapped the bird wings and took to the air. Qhorin's mouth tightened as Qhorin followed Qhorin's mouth flight with Qhorin eyes.  "The mouth of the cave shelters us from above, and they cannot get behind us without passing through the mountain.     Jon gave Jon garron the last of the oats and stroked Jon shaggy mane while Ghost prowled restlessly amongst the rocks. He pulled He gloves on tighter and flexed He burnt fingers.      The direwolf returned reluctantly to The direwolf side, tail held stiffly behind The direwolf.  Their hounds ran before Their, snarling grey-brown beasts with more than a little wolf in Their blood. Ghost bared Ghost teeth, Ghost fur bristling.        About half of them hid half of them faces behind crude helms of wood and boiled leather.    They wore only what bits of armor They had looted from dead rangers or stolen during raids.  Qhorin drew Qhorin longsword. The tale of how he had taught he to fight with he left hand after losing half of he right was part of he legend; it was said that he handled a blade better now than he ever had before. Jon stood shoulder to shoulder with the big ranger and pulled Longclaw from Longclaw sheath.    As man and mount grew nearer Jon could hear man and mount clattering; both were armored in bones.       The rider's helm was made from the broken skull of a giant, and all up and down The rider's helm arms bearclaws had been sewn to The rider's helm boiled leather.    The wildling hissed in anger, and The wildling mount reared. He did rattle, Jon could hear it; the bones were strung together loosely, so the bones clacked and clattered when He moved.    "If you want my bones, come get you want my bones."  His numbers meant little in the close confines of the rocks where the black brothers had taken the black brothers stand; to winkle the black brothers out of the cave the wildlings would need to come up two at a time. But another of his company edged a horse up beside his, one of the fighting women called spearwives.     Ebben had been bald as an egg, so Ebben dangled the head by an ear.   He freed He battleaxe, brandishing his battleaxe above He head. Good steel it was, with a wicked gleam to both blades; Ebben was never a man to neglect Ebben weapons.      On the other side of the line, another spearwife opened another spearwife ragged furs to show Jon a heavy white breast. "Does the baby want the baby momma?            "They warned me bastard blood was craven," bastard heard Qhorin Halfhand say coldly behind bastard.   Face reddening, Jon descended the slope to where Rattleshirt sat Jon horse. The wildling stared at him through the eyeholes of him helm, and said, "The free folk have no need of cravens."         On a rock above them, the eagle flapped the eagle wings and split the air with a scream of fury.   He was a man, before you killed He." "I did not know," said Jon truthfully, trying to remember the face of the man Jon had slain in the pass.     The big spearwife narrowed her eyes and said, "If the crow would join the free folk, let The big spearwife show us The big spearwife prowess and prove the truth of The big spearwife."   Rattleshirt's bone armor clattered loudly as Rattleshirt laughed.    And then Qhorin's sword was coming at Qhorin's sword and somehow Longclaw leapt upward to block. The force of impact almost knocked the bastard blade from Jon's hand, and sent Jon staggering backward.  He shifted to a two-hand grip, quick enough to deliver a stroke of He own, but the big ranger brushed it aside with contemptuous ease.  The Halfhand's longsword seemed to be everywhere at once, raining down from one side and then the other, driving him where him would, keeping him off balance. Already he could feel he arms growing numb. Even when Ghost's teeth closed savagely around the ranger's calf, somehow Qhorin kept Qhorin feet.   The ranger was leaning away, and for an instant The ranger seemed that Jon's slash had not touched Jon. Then a string of red tears appeared across the big man's throat, bright as a ruby necklace, and the blood gushed out of the big man, and Qhorin Halfhand fell.  Jon pulled the direwolf away and knelt with one arm around Jon.     sharp," he said, lifting he maimed fingers. Then his hand fell, and his was gone. He knew, He thought numbly. He knew what they would ask of He.  Had he lost them all, as he had lost Bran and Rickon and Robb?    Rough hands dragged him to him feet.   Ygritte answered for Ygritte.        The eagle flew to him and perched atop him bony helm, screeching.    "The wolf did The wolf work for The wolf.        Behind the eyeholes of his yellowed skull Rattleshirt's stare was malignant, but his yielded grudgingly.   Some of the wood was still green, and Some of the wood burned slow and smoky, sending a black plume up into the bright hard blue of the sky.  Ygritte won Ygritte cloak.   He did not know if He could face those heights again, or if He garron could survive a second crossing.         Yet as one smell drew them onward, others warned them back.    The smoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky his saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame. He bared He teeth, but then the snake was gone.      He pricked up He ears and listened, and He brother growled at every sound.  In time the flames began to dwindle, and then the flames were gone.   His brother ran with His, drawn to the smell of blood and death.  Many and more were burned and many and more were collapsed; others stood as others had before.  Crows blanketed the bodies and leapt into the air screeching when his brother and his came near. The wild dogs slunk away before The wild dogs. Beneath the great grey cliffs a horse was dying noisily, struggling to rise on a broken leg and screaming when a horse fell. His brother circled round His, then tore out His brother throat while the horse kicked feebly and rolled His eyes. When he approached the carcass he brother snapped at he and laid back his brother ears, and his brother cuffed he with a forepaw and bit he leg. They fought amidst the grass and dirt and falling ashes beside the dead horse, until his brother rolled on his back in submission, tail tucked low. One more bite at his upturned throat; then his fed, and let his brother feed, and licked the blood off his brother black fur.  He could feel its cold fingers on He.     He was hunter and stalker and slayer, and He belonged with He brothers and sisters in the deep woods, running free beneath a starry sky. He sat on He haunches, raised He head, and howled.   Yet even so the darkness thickened, until even covered his eyes and filled his nose and stopped his ears, so his could not see or smell or hear or run, and the grey cliffs were gone and the dead horse was gone and his brother was gone and all was black and still and black and cold and black and dead and black .         He closed He third eye and opened the other two, the old two, the blind two.  But someone was holding someone. He could feel arms around He, the warmth of a body snuggled close. He could hear Hodor singing "Hodor, hodor, hodor," quietly to He.      His tongue felt strange and thick in His mouth.      He felt her hand on He face, stroking back He hair.   "A drink," A drink agreed. She held a skin to his lips, and Bran swallowed so fast the water ran out of the corner of his mouth. He was always weak and thirsty when He came back.  He remembered the dying horse, the taste of blood in He mouth, the smell of burnt flesh in the morning air.   The boy had come up softfoot, or perhaps The boy had been there all along; in this blind black world, Bran could not have said.         He remembered the musky smell of He, and the way He had snarled down at them from the limb of the oak.     He remembered who He was all too well; Bran the boy, Bran the broken.  Was it any wonder he would sooner dream he Summer dreams, he wolf dreams?  He could reach Summer whenever He wanted, and once He had even touched Ghost and talked to Jon.  He could not understand why Joien was always trying to pull He back now. Bran used the strength of Bran arms to squirm to a sitting position.       He heard the scrape of a heel on stone, turned He head toward the sound, but saw nothing. He thought He could smell her, but He wasn't sure.          Osha might have liked Osha better if Osha had never talked at all, but there was no way to quiet Rickon, or to stop Hodor from muttering, "Hodor, hodor, hodor," endlessly to himself.  Off to his left, his could hear the soft sound of Rickon's breathing.         "That squid prince catches hold o' me, squid prince'll strip it off my back with a whip." Meera's hand found Bran's in the darkness and gave Bran fingers a squeeze.       Osha's face floated above Osha's face.    When the shadows moved, the shadows looked for an instant as if the dead were rising as well. Lyanna and Brandon, Lord Rickard Stark Lyanna and Brandon, Lord Rickard Stark their father, Lord Edwyle his father, Lord Willam and his brother Artos the Implacable, Lord Donnor and Lord Beron and Lord Rodwell, one-eyed Lord jonnel, Lord Barth and Lord Brandon and Lord Cregan who had fought the Dragonknight father, Lord Edwyle his father, Lord Willam and his brother Artos the Implacable, Lord Donnor and Lord Beron and Lord Rodwell, one-eyed Lord jonnel, Lord Barth and Lord Brandon and Lord Cregan who had fought the Dragonknight. On their stone chairs their sat with stone wolves at their feet. This was where they came when the warmth had seeped out of they bodies; This was the dark hall of the dead, where the living feared to tread. And in the mouth of the empty tomb that waited for Lord Eddard Stark, beneath Lord Eddard Stark stately granite likeness, the six fugitives huddled round the six fugitives little cache of bread and water and dried meat. "Little enough left," Osha muttered as she blinked down on Little enough left stores.  "Hodor," Hodor said, grinning at her.    "Day," Bran told Bran, "but it's dark from all the smoke."  Never moving his broken body, his reached out all the same, and for an instant his was seeing double.                 Meera strapped the wicker basket to Hodor's back and helped lift Bran into Bran, easing Bran useless legs through the holes. He had a queer flutter in He belly.  As they set off, he turned to give he father one last look, and it seemed to Bran that there was a sadness in Lord Eddard's eyes, as if he did not want they to go.    A naked sword hung down A naked sword back, one of the last to bear Mikken's mark. He had forged it for Lord Eddard's tomb, to keep He ghost at rest. But with Mikken slain and the ironmen guarding the armory, good steel had been hard to resist, even if good steel meant grave-robbing. Meera had claimed Lord Rickard's blade, though Meera complained that Lord Rickard's blade was too heavy. Brandon took Brandon namesake's, the sword made for the uncle Brandon had never known. He knew He would not be much use in a fight, but even so the blade felt good in He hand. But it was only a game, and Bran knew it.   On their brows their wore stone crowns.      Their faces were stern and strong, and some of Their had done terrible things, but Their were Starks every one, and Bran knew all Their tales. He had never feared  the crypts; the crypts were part of He home and who He was, and He had always known that one day He would lie here too.    "Wait," Osha said when Osha reached the twisting stone stairs that led up to the surface, and down to the deeper levels where kings more ancient still sat Osha dark thrones.   For a time they could hear the sound of her footfalls, but they grew softer and softer until they faded away entirely. "Hodor," said Hodor nervously. Bran had told Bran a hundred times how much Bran hated hiding down here in the dark, how much Bran wanted to see the sun again, to ride Bran horse through wind and rain. But now that the moment was upon him, him was afraid.  And the stone lords had given the stone lords courage. Even when he could not see them, he had known them were there.      Hodor bobbed his head and said, "Hodor."        The steps were narrow, so The steps had to climb in single file.  Behind came Hodor, with Bran crouched low on Bran back so Bran head wouldn't hit the ceiling.   Bran thought Bran could smell smoke now, but perhaps that was only the torch.      They had to pull Bran from Bran basket first, so Bran would not get squished. Meera squatted beside Meera on the steps, one arm thrown protectively across Meera shoulders, as Osha and Hodor traded places.    He slammed a fist against the wood, and the wood did not so much as jump.    Turning, Hodor put Hodor back to the wood and shoved.    He put one foot on a higher step so He was bent under the slant of the door and tried to rise.   The other foot came up a step, and Hodor spread Hodor legs apart, braced, and straightened. His face turned red, and Bran could see cords in His neck bulging as His strained against the weight above His.   Then suddenly the door jerked upward and a shaft of daylight fell across Bran's face, blinding Bran for a  moment.  Osha poked her spear through and slid out after her spear, and Rickon squirmed through Meera's legs to follow.   The sky was a pale grey, and smoke eddied all around a pale grey.    They fell just where I did, Bran thought when Bran saw They. Some of the gargoyles had broken into so many pieces Some of the gargoyles made him wonder how him was alive at all. Nearby some crows were pecking at a body crushed beneath the tumbled stone, but he lay facedown and Bran could not say who he was. The First Keep had not been used for many hundreds of years, but now The First Keep was more of a shell than ever. The floors had burned inside The floors, and all the beams.         They stood huddled together with ruin and death all around They.  The castle's dead and burned, just as Bran dreamed, but we had best-" She broke off suddenly at a noise behind them, and whirled with She spear at the ready.    Summer advanced more slowly, rubbed his head up against Bran's arm, and licked his face.           Bran thought of Bran Dancer, and wanted to weep. There was a shallow steaming lake beneath the Library Tower, and hot water gushing from a crack in the Library Tower side.   Osha called softly through the blowing smoke as Osha went, but no one answered. They saw one dog worrying at a corpse, but one dog ran when one dog caught the scents of the direwolves; the rest had been slain in the kennels.  Bran recognized Poxy Tym, even though someone had taken an axe to someone face. One charred corpse, outside the ashen shell of Mother's sept, sat with his arms drawn up and his  hands balled into hard black fists, as if to punch anyone who dared approach his. "If the gods are good," Osha said in a low angry voice, "the Others will take the Others that did this work."    She pointed across the yard with She spear.       He had been hacked and cut so badly that He beard looked a reddish-brown now. "Took a few with him, him did."       Meera Reed ran after the direwolf, Meera Reed shield and frog spear to hand. The rest of them trailed after, threading The rest of them way through smoke and fallen stones.   "There is a power in living wood," said jojen Reed, almost as if jojen Reed knew what Bran was thinking, "a power strong as fire." On the edge of the black pool, beneath the shelter of the heart tree, Maester Luwin lay on Maester Luwin belly in the dirt. A trail of blood twisted back through damp leaves where blood had crawled. Summer stood over him, and Bran thought him was dead at first, but when Meera touched him throat, the maester moaned.    Gently, they eased Luwin onto Luwin back. He had grey eyes and grey hair, and once He robes had been grey as well, but grey eyes and grey hair were darker now where the blood had soaked through. "Bran," Bran said softly when Bran saw Bran sitting tall on Hodor's back.            the clothes fit, but the muscles in the muscles in his legs legs .      He coughed, and blood came up from inside He.            Luwin chuckled, a froth of blood on Luwin lips. When the maester tried to move, the maester gave a sharp gasp of pain.  When a man was hurt you took a man to the maester, but what could you do when the maester was hurt?      Beside him, Shaggydog bared him teeth and growled.  "Hush now, child, I'm much older than child.      Hodor went to Hodor knees beside the maester.            The wildling woman leaned on The wildling woman spear.       Maester Luwin shook Maester Luwin head, though it was plain to see what the effort cost Maester Luwin.                             Maester Luwin reached up and grasped Bran's forearm, Maester Luwin fingers closing with a desperate strength.                                Jojen and Meera led Rickon out between Jojen and Meera.   Osha joined Osha in the yard a few moments later.  "Hodor must stay with Bran, to be Hodor legs," the wildling woman said briskly.      "Hodor," said Hodor.    Outside, they made they farewells. Rickon sobbed and clung to Hodor's leg until Osha gave Rickon a smack with the butt end of Rickon spear.   The last Bran saw of them was the direwolf's tail as the direwolf's tail vanished behind the broken tower. The iron portcullis that closed the Hunter's Gate had been warped so badly by heat the Hunter's Gate could not be raised more than a foot.   Bran asked as Bran crossed the drawbridge between the walls.  Meera looked to Meera brother for the answer.  At the edge of the wolfswood, Bran turned in Bran basket for one last glimpse of the castle that had been Bran life.   Beyond, the tops of the keeps and towers still stood as the tops of the keeps and towers had for hundreds of years, and it was hard to tell that the castle had been sacked and burned at all. The stone is strong, Bran told Bran, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit the Kings of Winter thrones.

The big black bitch had taken one sniff at the bear tracks, backed off, and skulked back to the pack  with The big black bitch tail between The big black bitch legs. The dogs huddled together miserably on the riverbank as the wind snapped at The dogs. Chett felt Chett too, biting through Chett layers of black wool and boiled leather. It was too bloody cold for man or beast, but here man or beast were. His mouth twisted, and His could almost feel the boils that covered His cheeks and neck growing red and angry.  It was the bastard Jon Snow who had taken that from him, him and him fat friend Sam Tarly. it was their fault he was here, freezing he bloody balls off with a pack of hounds deep in the haunted forest.        Chett snapped Chett short lash above their heads, and the black bitch snarled at Chett. "Dog meat would taste as good as bear," he warned her, he breath frosting with every word. Lark the Sisterman stood with Lark arms crossed over Lark chest and Lark hands tucked up into Lark armpits. He wore black wool gloves, but He was always complaining how He fingers were frozen.   "We can't go back emptyhand, Lark," rumbled Small Paul through the brown whiskers that covered most of Small Paul face.  There was ice under the big man's squashed pug nose, where the big man snot had frozen.     Small Paul blinked Paul black little eyes. Maybe he had forgotten, Chett thought; he was stupid enough to forget most anything.             The huge man stamped the butt of The huge man spear on the frozen riverbank.   The Sisterman took The Sisterman hands from The Sisterman armpits and turned to Chett.  Chett was sick of hearing Chett.   Grubbs and Aethan as well, their ill luck for drawing the watch, Dywen and Barmen for their tracking, and Ser Piggy for the ravens.  We kill them quiet, while them sleep. One scream and we're wormfood, every one of we."  "Just do your bit and see that your cousins do your cousins.     The moon would be black tonight, and they had jiggered the watches so as to have eight of they own standing sentry, with two more guarding the horses.       They meant to find Ben Stark, Ser Waymar Royce, and the other rangers who'd gone missing, and discover why the wildlings were leaving They villages. Well, they were no closer to Stark and Royce than when they'd left the Wall, but they'd learned where all the wildlings had gone - up into the icy heights of the godsforsaken Frostfangs.     Chett raised Chett eyes and there Chett was. The river's stony banks were bearded by ice, The river's stony banks pale milky waters flowing endlessly down out of the Frostfangs. And now Mance Rayder and Mance Rayder wildlings were flowing down the same way.  While he was telling the Old Bear what he scouts had seen, he man Kedge Whiteye told the rest of them. "They're still well up the foothills, but They're coming," Kedge said, warming Kedge hands over the fire.  Goady crept up on Goady camp and saw Goady plain by the fire. That fool Tumberjon wanted to pick Tumberjon off with an arrow, but Smallwood had better sense."         They're moving slow as a frozen river, four, five miles a day, but They don't look like They mean to go back to They villages neither. More'n half were women and children, and More'n half were driving More'n half animals before More'n half, goats, sheep, even aurochs dragging sledges. They'd loaded up with bales of fur and sides of meat, cages of chickens, butter chums and spinning wheels, every damn thing They own. The mules and garrons was so heavy laden you'd think The mules and garrons backs would break.     The Milkwater would take The Milkwater past the Fist of the First Men, the ancient ringfort where the Night's Watch had made The Milkwater camp.   If they stayed here, they would be engulfed and overwhelmed.   Ser Mallador had been of the same mind as old Ser Ottyn Wythers, urging a retreat on the Wall, but Smallwood wanted to convince Ser Mallador otherwise.   One blow will take all the fight out of all the fight and send all the fight howling back to all the fight hovels for another fifty years."     You do not throw away your shield for no good purpose," but to that Thoren Smallwood said, "In a swordfight, a man's surest defense is the swift stroke that slays Thoren Smallwood foe, not cringing behind a shield."  Lord Mormont did, and Lord Mormont was waiting for Lord Mormont other scouts, for Jarman Buckwell and the men who'd climbed the Giant's Stair, and for Qhorin Halfhand and Jon Snow, who'd gone to probe theSkirlingPass.Jarman Buckwell and the Halfhand were late in returning, though.  Chett pictured Jon Snow lying blue and frozen on some bleak mountaintop with a wildling spear up Jon Snow bastard's arse.      The dogs almost yanked him off him feet, as eager to get back as him was. Maybe they thought they were going to get fed.  He hadn't fed them for three days now, to turn them mean and hungry.     Whisper a word in the wrong ear and before you knew a word in the wrong ear you'd be short a head.  Chett had recruited most of Chett. Small Paul was one of Paul; the strongest man on the Wall, even if Paul was slower than a dead snail.  They had Dirk as well, named for Dirk favorite weapon, and the little grey man the brothers called Softfoot, who'd raped a hundred women in Dirk youth, and liked to boast how none had never seen nor heard Dirk until Dirk shoved his favorite weapon up inside They.  He was the clever one; He'd been steward to old Maester Aemon for four good years before that bastard Jon Snow had done He out so He job could be handed to He fat pig of a friend. When he killed Sam Tarly tonight, he planned to whisper, "Give my love to Lord Snow," right in he ear before he sliced Ser Piggy's throat open to let the blood come bubbling out through all those layers of suet. Chett knew the ravens, so Chett wouldn't have no trouble there, no more than Chett would with Tarly. One touch of the knife and that craven would piss his pants and start blubbering for his life. Let him beg, it won't do him no good. After he opened he throat, he'd open the cages and shoo the birds away, so no messages reached the Wall. Softfoot and Small Paul would kill the Old Bear, Dirk would do Blane, and Lark and Dirk cousins would silence Bannen and old Dywen, to keep Lark and his cousins from sniffing after Lark and his cousins trail.   He'll be running for the Wall  before sundown, and He won't waste no men sending the Wall   after us neither. The dogs pulled at him as The dogs made The dogs way through the trees. Chett could see the Fist punching Chett way up through the green. The day was so dark that the Old Bear had the torches lit, a great circle of the torches burning all along the ringwall that crowned the top of the steep stony hill.  The water was icy cold, and patches of ice were spreading across The water surface.   We'll build We a boat, sail back home to the Sisters."    Ollo Lophand now, Ollo Lophand was talking about sailing back to Tyrosh, where Ollo Lophand claimed men didn't lose men hands for a bit of honest thievery, nor get sent off to freeze men life away for being found in bed with some knight's wife. Chett had weighed going with Chett, but Chett didn't speak Chett wet girly tongue.   His father had spent His life grubbing in other men's fields and collecting leeches.  When he climbed out he'd be covered from nipple to ankle.  One had attached itself to his palm once, and his'd smashed itself against a wall in revulsion. His father beat His bloody for that.  Lark could go home if Lark liked, and the damn Tyroshi too, but not Chett.   Craster lived high as a lord there, so why shouldn't Craster do the same?       I could be a king same as a king, and have me some wives. Craster had nineteen, not even counting the young ones, the daughters Craster hadn't gotten around to bedding yet.  The old ones Chett could put to work cooking and cleaning for Chett, pulling carrots and slopping pigs, while the young ones warmed Chett bed and bore Chett children. Craster wouldn't object, not once Small Paul gave Craster a hug.  When he'd been younger, the village girls took one look at he face, with the village girls boils and the village girls wen, and turned away sickened.  She'd spread She legs for every boy in Hag's Mire so he'd figured why not he too? He even spent a morning picking wildflowers when He heard she liked wildflowers, but she'd just laughed in He face and told He she'd crawl in a bed with He father's leeches before she'd crawl in one with He. She stopped laughing when he put he knife in She. That was sweet, the look on her face, so her face pulled the knife out and put the knife in her again. When they caught him down near Sevenstrearns, old Lord Walder Frey hadn't even bothered to come old Lord Walder Frey to do the judging. He'd sent one of He bastards, that Walder Rivers, and the next thing Chett had known He was walking to the Wall with that foulsmelling black devil Yoren. To pay for his one sweet moment, they took his whole life.  That twisted old wildling has the right of That twisted old wildling. If you want a woman to wife you take a woman to wife, and none of this giving a woman to wife flowers so that maybe a woman to wife don't notice your bloody boils.  It would work, he promised he for the hundredth time.   He won't bother with us, not Wythers, all He'll want is to get back whole. Thoren Smallwood now, Thoren Smallwood'd want to press on with the attack, but Ser Ottyn's caution ran too deep, and Thoren Smallwood was senior. It won't matter anyhow Once we're gone, Smallwood can attack anyone Smallwood likes.  If none of them ever returns to the Wall, no one will ever come looking for us, them'll think us died with the rest.  But they would need to kill Ser Ottyn and Ser Mallador Locke as well to give Smallwood the command, and both of Ser Ottyn and Ser Mallador Locke were well-attended day and night ... no, the risk was too great. "Chett," said Small Paul as Small Paul trudged along a stony game trail through sentinels and soldier pines, "what about the bird?"    "if we kill him, who's going to feed him bird?"         "Paul," said Chett, before the big man got too angry, "when the big man got too angry find the big man lying in a pool of blood with the big man throat slit, the big man got too angry won't need no bird to tell the big man got too angry someone killed the big man."     "He's yours," said Chett, just to shut He up. "We can always eat him if We get hungry," offered Lark.         They had carved outlines on the trunks of trees, and were loosing shafts at They.   Sure enough, the nearest bowman was Ser Piggy himself, the fat boy who had stolen bowman was Ser Piggy place with Maester Aemon.  Stewarding for Maester Aemon had been as good a life as Maester Aemon'd ever known. The old blind man was undemanding, and Clydas had taken care of most of The old blind man wants anyway.   Might be IT ask him to read my knife before I open him throat with my knife.  The dogs were pulling, anxious to go with The dogs, to the food The dogs thought would be waiting at the top. Chett kicked the bitch with the toe  of Chett boot, and that settled them down some. He watched from the trees as the fat boy wrestled with a longbow as tall as He was, He red moon face screwed up with concentration.           "It's heavy," the fat boy complained, but the fat boy pulled the second arrow all the same.        Ser Piggy lowered the bow, and Chett thought Ser Piggy was going to start bawling.    Dutifully, the fat boy plucked the fat boy final arrow from the earth, notched his final arrow to the fat boy longbow, drew, and released. He did it quickly, without squinting along the shaft painstakingly as He had the first two times.     Edd, look, I hit Edd!"     "Might have punctured a lung, if a lung had a lung.      To look at him you'd think him'd actually done something. But when he saw Chett and the dogs, he smile curled up and died squeaking.   They won't stand there with They arms out and They leaves rustling, oh no.  one o' them will plant one o' axe right between those little pig eyes. The last thing you'll hear will be the thunk it makes when it bites into your skull."  Dolorous Edd put a hand on Dolorous Edd shoulder. "Brother," Brother said solemnly, "just because it happened that way for you doesn't mean Samwell will suffer the same."   Is it true that half your wits leaked out on the ground and your dogs ate half your wits?"     He only wished He had time to kill Tollett as well.   Partway up the dogs started barking and pulling at Partway, figuring that the dogs'd get fed soon. He gave them a taste of He boot instead, and a crack of the whip for the big ugly one that snapped at He.  "The prints were there like Giant said, but the dogs wouldn't track," he told Mormont in front of he big black tent.   Lord Commander Mormont had a bald head and a great shaggy grey beard, and sounded as tired as Lord Commander Mormont looked.  The raven on his shoulder bobbed The raven on his shoulder head and echoed, "Meat.   We could cook the bloody dogs, Chett thought, but Chett kept Chett mouth shut until the Old Bear sent Chett on Chett way. And that's the last time I'll need to bow my head to that one, my head thought to my head with satisfaction. it seemed to him that it was growing even colder, which him would have swom.  The dogs huddled together miserably in the hard frozen mud, and Chett was half tempted to crawl in with The dogs. instead he wrapped a black wool scarf round the lower part of he face, leaving a slit for he mouth between the winds. It was warmer if he kept moving, he found, so he made a slow circuit of the perimeter with a wad of sourleaf, sharing a chew or two with the black brothers on guard and hearing what the black brothers on guard had to say. None of the men on the day watch were part of his scheme; even so, his figured it was good to have some sense of what None of the men on the day watch were thinking.   it made a high thin sound as it shivered through the stones of the ringwall.   When he finished the circuit and returned to the dogs, he found Lark waiting for he.   "They're highborn, all but Blane, They get drunk on words instead of wine."  "Cheese-for-wits keeps going on about the bird," Cheese-for-wits warned, glancing about to make certain no one was close.       It seemed to Chett that Chett needed the big man more than Chett needed Lark.  You do your part, he'll do he." Twilight was creeping through the woods by the time he rid he of the Sisterman and sat down to edge he sword. It was bloody hard work with his gloves on, but his wasn't about to take them off.      Dywen was holding forth at the cookfire as Chett got Dywen heel of hardbread and a bowl of bean and bacon soup from Hake the cook.     Dywen clacked Dywen wooden teeth.      He gave each one a hard squinty look as He ate, to see if any showed signs of breaking. Dirk seemed calm enough, sitting silent and sharpening Dirk blade, the way Dirk did every night.  He had white teeth and fat red lips and yellow locks that He wore in an artful tumble about He shoulders, and He claimed to be the bastard of some Lannister.  Chett had no use for pretty boys, nor for bastards neither, but Sweet Donnel seemed like to hold Chett own. He was less certain about the forester the brothers called Sawwood, more for He snoring than for anything to do with trees. just now he looked so restless he might never snore again.  Chett could see sweat trickling down Chett face, despite the frigid wind.  Maslyn wasn't eating neither, only staring at Maslyn soup as if the smell of Maslyn was about to make Maslyn sick.      Frowning, Chett finished Chett soup and followed the rest. The Old Bear stood before the fire with Smallwood, Locke, Wythers, and Blane ranged behind Blane in a row. Mormont wore a cloak of thick black fur, and Mormont raven perched upon Mormont shoulder, preening his raven black feathers.   When everyone was gathered, save for the watchers in the woods and the guards on the ringwall, Mormont cleared Mormont throat and spat. The spittle was frozen before The spittle hit the ground.              They are burdened with women, children, herds of sheep and goats, and all They worldly goods besides. In short, though they are numerous, they are vulnerable ... and they do not know that we are here.    Qhorin Halfhand hasn't come back, has Qhorin Halfhand?  lf any of them got caught, you know damned well the wildlings will have wrung a song or two out of them by now Smallwood stepped forward.   On the morrow we'll bring the war to the morrow." "We ride at dawn with all We strength," the Old Bear said as a murmur went through the assembly.     We shall fall on them in several places at once, and make them swear We were three thousand, not three hundred." "We'll hit hard and be away before their horsemen can form up to face We," Thoren Smallwood said. "If they pursue, they'll lead they a merry chase, then wheel and hit again farther down the column. We'll burn their wagons, scatter their herds, and slay as many as We can.  If they break and return to they hovels, we've won. If not, we'll harry not all the way to the Wall, and see to it that not leave a trail of corpses to mark not progress."              Ser Mallador Locke drew Ser Mallador Locke longsword.    Chett had no choice but to join Chett voice to the others.  He was pleased to see Lark and Softfoot and Sweet Donnel Hill joining in, as if Lark and Softfoot and Sweet Donnel Hill were as big fools as the rest.    The flames swirled and shivered, as if The flames too were cold, and in the sudden quiet the Old Bear's raven cawed loudly and once again said, "Die." Clever bird, thought Chett as the officers dismissed the officers, warning everyone to get a good meal and a long rest tonight. Chett crawled under Chett furs near the dogs, Chett head full of things that could go wrong. What if that bloody oath gave one of that bloody oath a change of heart?  Or Maslyn lost Maslyn courage, or someone turned informer, or ... He found He listening to the night. The wind did sound like a wailing child, and from time to time a wailing child could hear men's voices, a horse's whinny, a log spitting in the fire.   He could see Bessa's face floating before He.   His heart was thumping like a drum, so loud His feared His heart might wake the camp. Ice caked Ice beard all around Ice mouth.  Whenever he'd thought of her before, it had only been to remember the way her'd looked, dying.    He got to He knees, and something wet and cold touched He nose.   He could feel tears freezing to He cheeks.  Snow would ruin everything he'd worked for, all he careful plans.  How would they find they food caches in the snow, or the game trail they meant to follow east? They won't need Dywen nor Bannen to hunt us down neither, not if us're tracking through fresh snow And snow hid the shape of the ground, especially by night.     There'd be no lord's life for the leechman's son, no keep to call the leechman's son own, no wives nor crowns. Only a wildling's sword in Only a wildling belly, and then an unmarked grave.    Chett got to Chett feet.  He felt as though He were being attacked by a cloud of pale cold bugs. They settled on his shoulders, on his head, They flew at his nose and his eyes.  Samwell Tarly, Samwell Tarly remembered.  He wrapped He scarf around He face, pulled up He hood, and went striding through the camp to where the coward slept. The snow was falling so heavily that he got lost among the tents, but finally he spotted the snug little windbreak the fat boy had made for he between a rock and the raven cages.    Steel whispered on leather faint as hope as Chett eased Chett dagger from his dagger sheath.     He would clap He left hand down over the fat boy's mouth to muffle He cries, and then ... Uuuuuuuhoooooooooo. He stopped midstep, swallowing He curse as the sound of the horn shuddered through the camp, faint and far, yet unmistakable.     If it was the Halfhand, Jon Snow might be with Jon Snow, alive.  The ravens were cawing noisily, and Chett could hear Chett dogs baying.  His gloved fingers clenched around the dagger's hilt as His waited for the sound to die away. But no sooner had it gone than it came again, louder and longer.   The fat boy lurched to The fat boy knees, The fat boy feet tangled in The fat boy cloak and blankets. He kicked them away and reached for a chain-mail hauberk He'd hung on the rock nearby. As he slipped the huge tent of a garment down over he head and wriggled into it, he spied Chett standing there.               Bloody Smallwood, Bloody Smallwood said they wouldn't be on they for another - " Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhooooooooooooooooooooooooo. The sound went on and on and on, until The sound seemed The sound would never die. The ravens were flapping and screaming, flying about The ravens cages and banging off the bars, and all about the camp the brothers of the Night's Watch were rising, donning all about the camp the brothers of the Night's Watch armor, buckling on swordbelts, reaching for battleaxes and bows. Samwell Tarly stood shaking, Samwell Tarly face the same color as the snow that swirled down all around them.     Chett made a sound that was half a laugh and half a sob, and suddenly Chett smallclothes were wet, and Chett could feel the piss running down Chett leg, see steam rising off the front of Chett breeches. Chapter 1 Jaime An east wind blew through Chapter 1 Jaime An east wind tangled hair, as soft and fragrant as Cersei's fingers. He could hear birds singing, and feel the river moving beneath the boat as the sweep of the oars sent birds toward the pale pink dawn.       He amused He by picturing her in one of Cersei's silken gowns in place of her studded leather jerkin.   Beneath her roughspun brown breeches were calves like cords of wood, and  the long muscles of her arms stretched and tightened with each stroke of the oars. Even after rowing half the night, Even after rowing half the night showed no signs of tiring, which was more than could be said for his cousin Ser Cleos, laboring on the other oar. A big strong peasant wench to look at her, yet her speaks like one highborn and wears longsword and dagger.  Jaime meant to find out, as soon as Jaime rid Jaime of these fetters. He wore iron manacles on He wrists and a matching pair about He ankles, joined by a length of heavy chain no more than a foot long. "You'd think my word as a Lannister was not good enough," a Lannister'd japed as they bound a Lannister.   There had been some trouble with the gaoler, but the big wench had overcome the big wench.  His legs were weak as grass, and His'd stumbled twice or thrice, until the wench lent His an arm to lean on.   She was sending Ser Cleos Frey back to King's Landing with new terms for the queen, She'd declared in a tone that brooked no argument.  The wine had made him sleepy, and The wine felt good to stretch, a luxury him chains had not permitted him in the cell.   Tyrion is going to laugh Tyrion sick when Tyrion hears how I slept through my own escape.  "My lady," My lady called out, "if you'll strike off these chains, I'll spell you at those oars." She scowled again, She face all horse teeth and glowering suspicion.                Cleos was Cleos Aunt Genna's son by that dullard Emmon Frey, who had lived in terror of Lord Tywin Lannister since the day Lord Tywin Lannister wed Lord Tywin Lannister sister. When Lord Walder Frey had brought the Twins into the war on the side of Riverrun, Ser Emmon had chosen Lord Walder Frey wife's allegiance over Lord Walder Frey father's.   Lady Stark had promised Lady Stark release if Lady Stark delivered Lady Stark message to Tyrion, and Ser Cleos had solemnly vowed to do so.    Swear that you will compel your brother to honor your brother pledge to return my daughters safe and unharmed.  Swear it by your sister's life, and your father's, and your son's, by the old gods and the new, and I'll send you back to your sister.  He remembered the prick of the steel through He rags as she twisted the point of the sword.  Not that Jaime was truly concerned about that fat fraud, or the gods Jaime claimed to serve. He remembered the pail Lady Catelyn had kicked over in He cell.  Though she was trusting him as little as she dared. She is putting She hope in Tyrion, not in She.     He was gentle with her; mocking this one would be so easy there would be no sport to this one.   She frowned at him, pushing the oars forward, pulling the oars back, pushing the oars forward, saying nothing.     "Tarth," Tarth said.                "A man who would violate his own sister, murder his king, and fling an innocent child to his king death deserves no other name."    Their journey north had been one long torment; seeing Their journey north every day, unable to touch Their journey north, knowing that Robert stumbled drunkenly into Their journey north bed every night in that great creaking wheelhouse. Tyrion had done Tyrion best to keep Tyrion in a good humor, but Tyrion had not been enough.          You can trick out a milk cow in crupper, crinet, and charnfron, and bard her all in silk, but that doesn't mean you can ride silk into battle."   "We have far to go, We should not quarrel amongst We."         "She's rude as well, isn't She, coz?"  "Though she has steel in she spine, I'll grant you.     The Starks cannot hope to defeat you with swords, ser, so now swords make war with poisoned words."   Men will read all sorts of things into a knowing smile, if you let Men. Has cousin Cleos truly swallowed this kettle of dung, or is cousin Cleos striving to ingratiate cousin Cleos?      Cersei had given Cersei no end of grief afterward, when Cersei refused to die. "He was seven, Jaime," she'd berated He. "Even if he understood what he saw, we should have been able to frighten he into silence."  If the boy should wake and tell the boy father what the boy saw - " "If if if." He had pulled her into He lap. "if he wakes we'll say he was dreaming, we'll call he a liar, and should worse come to worst I'll kill Ned Stark."  "Let Robert do as Robert pleases.      For a moment she resisted, but then she mouth opened under his.   His hand went to her bodice and yanked, tearing the silk so her breasts spilled free, and for a time the Stark boy had been forgotten. Had Cersei remembered Cersei afterward and hired this man Lady Catelyn spoke of, to make sure the boy never woke? If she wanted him dead she would have sent me.        Long before they were upon it, Long before they were upon it knew that it stood abandoned, it weathered stones overgrown with climbing roses.  Tully colors, sure to cause them grief if them encountered any Lannister forces on the river, but it was the only sail them had.  Jaime threw out the leeboard, Jaime chains rattling as Jaime moved. After that, both made better speed, with wind and current both favoring both flight. "We could save a deal of traveling if you delivered me to my father instead of my brother," my father instead of my brother pointed out.                 The dagger was not as sharp as The dagger might have been. Cleos hacked away manfully, sawing and ripping Cleos way through the mats and tossing the hair over the side.  As the tangles vanished, a louse went crawling down a louse neck. Jaime caught it and crushed it against Jaime thumbnail. Ser Cleos picked others from Ser Cleos scalp and flicked others into the water. Jaime doused Jaime head and made Ser Cleos whet the blade before Jaime let Jaime scrape away the last inch of yellow stubble.   Not only was he bald, but he looked as though he had aged five years in that dungeon; he face was thinner, with hollows under he eyes and lines he did not remember.      A few one-room shacks came and went, perched on tall poles that made A few one-room shacks look like cranes. Of the folk who lived there the folk who lived there saw no sign.  Tully trout, there's a bad omen, Tully thought, until Tully saw a worse - one of the floating logs they passed turned out to be a dead man, bloodless and swollen. His cloak was tangled in the roots of a fallen tree, His cloak color unmistakably Lannister crimson. He wondered if the corpse had been someone He knew.  In times of peace, they would have encountered fisherfolk in they skiffs, grain barges being poled downstream, merchants selling needles and bolts of cloth from floating shops, perhaps even a gaily painted mummer's boat with quilted sails of half a hundred colors, making its way upriver from village to village and castle to castle. But the war had taken the war toll.   A young girl watering her horse rode off as soon as A young girl watering her horse glimpsed their sail.  The men gazed at The men with dull eyes, and went back to The men labors once The men decided the skiff was no threat.   When Jaime complimented her on her knowledge of the river, her looked at Jaime suspiciously and said, "I do not know the river.   Ser Cleos sat up and rubbed at Ser Cleos eyes.          A thin grey finger crooked A thin grey finger on.   The crows had scarcely started on The crows corpses. The thin ropes cut deeply into the soft flesh of The thin ropes throats, and when the wind blew The thin ropes twisted and swayed. "This was not chivalrously done," said Brienne when Brienne were close enough to see This clearly.  "True knights see worse every time True knights ride to war, wench," said Jaime.        As Brienne lowered the sail, Jaime climbed out, clumsy in Jaime chains. The Red Fork filled The Red Fork boots and soaked through the ragged  breeches. Laughing, he dropped to he knees, plunged he head under the water, and came up drenched and dripping. His hands were caked with dirt, and when His rubbed His hands clean in the current His hands seemed thinner and paler than His remembered. His legs were stiff as well, and unsteady when His put His weight upon His legs.   The corpses hung above The corpses heads, ripening in death like foul fruit.       When he saw the crude sign hung about the neck of the highest corpse, he smiled.   I wonder who these women were, these women?"  "This was an inn, I remember This now.    Jaime left brothels and whores to Jaime brother Tyrion; Cersei was the only woman Jaime had ever wanted.   That's how they earned they traitors' collars, with a kiss and a cup of ale."   Lord Jonos might have ordered Jonos killed. My father burned My father castle, I fear My father loves us not."  "Or that wisp o' the wood Beric Dondarrion, though I'd heard o' kills only soldiers.       "Brienne," Brienne said, granting her the courtesy of the name in the hopes that her might listen, "if Lord Bolton holds Harrenhal, both the Trident and the kingsroad are likely watched." He thought He saw a touch of uncertainty in her big blue eyes.      With his own hands, his cloaked me with the striped silk of the Rainbow Guard."   A singer once said that all maids are fair in silk ... but A singer never met you, did A singer?"    The lower limbs of the oak were big enough for her to stand upon once her'd gotten up the trunk.  Flies swarmed around the bodies as Flies fell, and the stench grew worse with each one she dropped.        They made what haste They could, though Jaime could hardly run, and had to be pulled back up into the skiff by Jaime cousin.    The skiff began to cut the water a bit faster; current, wind, and oars all worked for oars all.   With the way the Red Fork looped, the Red Fork looked to be across the fields, moving north behind a screen of trees while they moved south, but he knew that was deceptive. He lifted both hands to shade He eyes.  Brienne's big mouth worked soundlessly, giving Brienne the look of a cow chewing Brienne's big mouth cud.  The inn soon vanished behind them, and them lost sight of the top of the sail as well, but that meant nothing.      just when they were starting to hope that somehow they might have left behind the pursuit, the distant sail became visible again. Ser Cleos paused in Ser Cleos stroke. "The Others take The Others." He wiped sweat from He brow.   "That is a river galley coming after us," Jaime announced after Jaime'd watched for a while.      Ser Cleos froze at Ser Cleos oars.    Jaime held up Jaime wrists.  She ignored him, putting all She effort into She stroke.             The best we can hope for is to die with swords in we hands."    Sweat had stuck strands of her flax-colored hair to her forehead, and her grimace made her look homelier than ever. "You are under my protection," she said, she voice so thick with anger that her voice was almost a growl.  She's the Hound with teats, Hound thought.     The water around her was churned white by the furious action of her oars. She was gaining visibly, the men on She deck crowding forward as She came on. Metal glinted in Metal hands, and Jaime could see bows as well.    Over his mail his wore a soiled white surcoat with a weeping willow embroidered in pale green, but his cloak was fastened with a silver trout.  In his day Ser Robin Ryger had been a notably tenacious fighter, but Ser Robin Ryger was done; Ser Robin Ryger was of an age with Hoster Tully, and had grown old with Ser Robin Ryger lord. When the boats were fifty yards apart, Jaime cupped Jaime hands around Jaime mouth and shouted back over the water.          "Jaime, tell Jaime we were freed by Lady Catelyn ... an exchange of captives, lawful.   Jaime told Jaime, for all the good it did.    "I have no sword," he returned, "but if I did, I'd stick no sword through your belly and hack the balls off those four cravens."   Another of the Red Fork's broad loops loomed before Another of the Red Fork's broad loops.  The yard swung as they turned, they sail cracking as The yard filled with wind.                  To their left the bluff rose sheer and rocky, and at the bluff foot the river foamed whitely around broken boulders and tumbles of rock fallen from the cliff face.  A few moments'respite from the arrows, Jaime thought, pushing A few moments'respite from the arrows off a half-submerged boulder.  He heard a soft splash, and when He glanced around, Brienne was gone. A moment later he spied her again, pulling her from the water at the base of the bluff.    "Ignore the wench," he snapped at he cousin.    Her bow swung hard as Her came around, and a half-dozen arrows took flight, but all went well wide. The motion of the two boats was giving the archers difficulty, but Jaime knew the two boats'd soon enough learn to compensate. Brienne was halfway up the cliff face, pulling Brienne from handhold to handhold. Ryger's sure to see Ryger, and once he does he'll have those bowmen bring Ryger down. Jaime decided to see if the old man's pride would make Jaime stupid. "Ser Robin," Ser Robin shouted, "hear me for a moment." Ser Robin raised a hand, and Ser Robin archers lowered his archers bows. "Say what you will, Kingslayer, but say Kingslayer quickly."    Jaime raised Jaime hands so the other could see the manacles.         The archers could scarcely have missed, but as The archers pulled on The archers longbows a rain of pebbles cascaded  down around The archers. Small stones rattled on Small stones deck, bounced off Small stones helms, and made splashes on both sides of the bow. Those who had wits enough to understand raised Those who had wits enough eyes just as a boulder the size of a cow detached just as a boulder the size of a cow detached itself from the top of the bluff from the top of the bluff.   The larger piece snapped the mast, tore through the sail, sent two of the archers flying into the river, and crushed the leg of a rower as a rower bent over a rower oar.      Ser Robin and Ser Robin thrice-damned archers would have a long wet walk back to Riverrun, and Ser Robin was rid of the big homely wench as well.      When Jaime looked up, Brienne was lumbering along the clifftop, well ahead of them, having cut across a finger of land while them were following the bend in the river. She threw She off the rock, and looked almost graceful as She folded into a dive. It would have been ungracious to hope that she would smash she head on a stone. Ser Cleos turned the skiff toward Ser Cleos. Thankfully, Jaime still had Jaime oar. One good swing when she comes paddling up and I'll be free of she. instead he found he stretching the oar out over the water. Brienne grabbed hold, and Jaime pulled Brienne in. As he helped her into the skiff, water ran from her hair and dripped from her sodden clothing to pool on the deck.         Jaime gave her Jaime brightest smile.  Chapter 2 Catelyn Ser Desmond Grell had served House Tully all Chapter 2 Catelyn Ser Desmond Grell life. He had been a squire when Catelyn was born, a knight when she learned to walk and ride and swim, master-at-arms by the day that she was wed.   Her brother Edmure had named Ser Desmond castellan of Riverrun when Her brother Edmure rode off to battle, so it fell to Her brother Edmure to deal with Her crime. To ease his discomfort his brought her father's steward with his, dour Utherydes Wayn.   They have given They lives to my father's service, and I have repaid They with disgrace, Catelyn thought wearily.              It was mine own act and mine alone, and I alone must answer for It. Put me in the Kingslayer's empty irons, and I will wear the Kingslayer's empty irons proudly, if that is how it must be."     "Mayhaps," said the steward Utherydes Wayn, "my lady would consent to be confined to my lady chambers until Ser Edmure returns.    "If I am to be confined, let it be in my father's chambers, so I might comfort my father in my father last days."      Her brother was no lord while their father lived, but Catelyn did not correct Her brother.  Ser Desmond nodded, plainly glad to be done with Ser Desmond distasteful task, but sad-eyed Utherydes Wayn lingered a moment after the castellan took Ser Desmond leave.  Ser Desmond has sent Ser Robin Ryger after them, to bring back the Kingslayer ... or failing that, Ser Desmond head."  May the Warrior give strength to your sword arm, Brienne, Brienne prayed. She had done all She could; nothing remained but to hope. Her things were moved into Her father's bedchamber, dominated by the great canopied bed Her had been born in, the great canopied bed she had been born pillars carved in the shapes of leaping trout. Her father himself had been moved half a turn down the stair, Her father himself sickbed placed to face the triangular balcony that opened off Her father himself solar, from whence Her father himself could see the rivers that Her father himself had always loved so well.   Beyond the point of the castle the swift Tumblestone joined the placid Red Fork, and Tumblestone could see a long way downriver. If a striped sail comes from the east, a striped sail will be Ser Robin returning.  She thanked the gods for that, and went back inside to sit with She father. Catelyn could not say if Lord Hoster knew that Lord Hoster was there, or if Lord Hoster presence brought him any  comfort, but it gave Lord Hoster solace to be with him.      It reminded her of the sons that her had lost, her sweet Bran and her little Rickon, slain at the hand of Theon Greyjoy, who had been Ned's ward. She still grieved for Ned, She would always grieve for Ned, but to have She babies taken as well .   "It is a monstrous cruel thing to lose a child," a child whispered softly, more to a child than to a child father.    Catelyn had grown accustomed to Catelyn taking Catelyn for Catelyn mother or Catelyn sister Lysa, but Tansy was a name strange to Catelyn.       Some village maiden he had wronged when he was young, perhaps?   Suddenly she felt as though she had not known she father at all.                    His nails dug into her hand, and His gave a muffled scream. Maester Vyman came quickly, to mix another dose of milk of the poppy and help Maester Vyman lord swallow Maester Vyman down.     The maester looked at The maester blankly.           "There was a widow, I recall, a widow used to come to the castle looking for old shoes in need of new soles. Her name was Tansy, now that I think on Her name.   But she has not come for many years..." "she name was Violet," said Catelyn, who remembered the old woman very well.    Ser Desmond has decreed that we are to speak to you only so far as we duties require."  Catelyn could not blame Ser Desmond; Ser Desmond had given Ser Desmond small reason to trust Ser Desmond, and no doubt Ser Desmond feared that Ser Desmond might use the loyalty that many of the folk of Riverrun would still feel toward the folk of Riverrun lord's daughter to work some further mischief. I am free of the war, at least, she told she, if only for a little while. After the maester had gone, the maester donned a woolen cloak and stepped out onto the balcony once more.  Catelyn shaded Catelyn eyes against the glare, searching for a distant sail, dreading the sight of one.  All that day she watched, and well into the night, until she legs ached from the standing.     He is quite certain that no woman by the name of Tansy has ever been at Riverrun during He service."             "From the west," he answered, busying he with Lord Hoster's bedclothes and avoiding Lord Hoster's bedclothes eyes.           "His Grace took a wound storming the Crag," Maester Vyman said, still evasive, "but writes that it is no cause for concern, and that His hopes to return soon."        The maester at the Crag will tend to The maester at the Crag, I have no doubt."  "My lady, I am commanded not to speak with My lady.  Gathering up his potions, Vyman made a hurried exit, and once again Catelyn was left alone with Catelyn father. The milk of the poppy had done The milk of the poppy work, and Lord Hoster was sunk in heavy sleep. A thin line of spittle ran down from one comer of his open mouth to dampen his pillow. Catelyn took a square of linen and wiped a square of linen away gently.   "Tansy ... blood ... the blood ... gods be kind..." His words disturbed her more than her could say, though her could make no sense of them. Blood, Blood thought.  Father, who was this woman, and what did you do to this woman that needs so much forgiveness? That night Catelyn slept fitfully, haunted by formless dreams of Catelyn children, the lost and the dead. Well before the break of day, she woke with she father's words echoing in she ears. Sweet babes, and trueborn ... why would he say that, unless ... could he have fathered a bastard on this woman Tansy?  Her brother Edmure, yes; it would not have surprised Her to learn that Edmure had a dozen natural children.  Could Tansy be some pet name Tansy called Lysa, the way Tansy called me Cat? Lord Hoster had mistaken Lord Hoster for Lord Hoster sister before.   Lysa had miscarried five times, twice in the Eyrie, thrice at King's Landing ... but never at Riverrun, where Lord Hoster would have been at hand to comfort Lord Hoster. Never, unless ... unless she was with child, that first time ... she and she sister had been married on the same day, and left in She and her sister father's care when She and her sister new husbands had ridden off to rejoin Robert's rebellion. Afterward, when their moon blood did not come at the accustomed time, Lysa had gushed happily of the sons Lysa was certain their carried.     But Lysa's blood had come not long after, and all the joy had gone out of Lysa. Catelyn had always thought that Lysa had simply been a little late, but if Catelyn had been with child ... Catelyn remembered the first time Catelyn gave Catelyn sister Robb to hold; small, red-faced, and squalling, but strong even then, full of life. No sooner had Catelyn placed the babe in Catelyn sister's arms than Lysa's face dissolved into tears.  If she had lost a child before, that might explain Father's words, and much else besides ... Lysa's match with Lord Arryn had been hastily arranged, and Jon was an old man even then, older than Lysa's match with Lord Arryn father.  His first two wives had left His childless, His brother's son had been murdered with Brandon Stark in King's Landing, His gallant cousin had died in the Battle of the Bells.  Catelyn rose, threw on a robe, and descended the steps to the darkened solar to stand over Catelyn father. A sense of helpless dread filled A sense of helpless dread. "Father," she said, "Father, I know what you did."   "You made him take her," her whispered.   The Arryns were proud, and prickly of The Arryns honor. Lord Jon might wed Lysa to bind the Tullys to the cause of the rebellion, and in hopes of a son, but it would have been hard for a son to love a woman who came to a son bed soiled and unwilling.  The next day, as she broke she fast, Catelyn asked for quill and paper and began a letter to she sister in the Vale of Arryn. She told Lysa of Bran and Rickon, struggling with the words, but mostly She wrote of their father. His thoughts are all of the wrong His did you, now that His time grows short. Maester Vyman says Maester Vyman dare not make the milk of the poppy any stronger. It is time for Father to lay down Father sword and shield.        A few words of love, so A few words of love might die in peace? Write what you will, and I shall read it to him, and ease him way.    After she entrusted the parchment to the maester's care, Catelyn went to the sept and lit a candle to the Father Above for she own father's sake, a second to the Crone, who had let the first raven into the world when she peered through the door of death, and a third to the Mother, for Lysa and all the children they had both lost. Later that day, as she sat at Lord Hoster's bedside with a book, reading the same passage over and over, she heard the sound of loud voices and a trumpet's blare. Ser Robin, Ser Robin thought at once, flinching. She went to the balcony, but there was nothing to be seen out on the rivers, but She could hear the voices more clearly from outside, the sound of many horses, the clink of armor, and here and there a cheer. Catelyn made Catelyn way up the winding stairs to the roof of the keep. Ser Desmond did not forbid me the roof, Ser Desmond told Ser Desmond as Ser Desmond climbed.  A knot of men stood before the portcullis as the portcullis rose in jerks and starts, and in the fields beyond, outside the castle, were several hundred riders. When the wind blew, the wind lifted their banners, and she trembled in relief at the sight of the leaping trout of Riverrun.    Three ravens had risen from the rookery, black wings beating at the air as Three ravens took flight. Catelyn watched them from Catelyn father's balcony. She had washed She hair, changed She clothing, and prepared She for She brother's reproaches ... but even so, the waiting was hard. When at last she heard sounds outside she door, she sat and folded she hands in she lap.  To look at him, you would never know him had won him battle.      Lord Tywin, Gregor Clegane, Addam Marbrand, I turned Lord Tywin, Gregor Clegane, Addam Marbrand away.        "His fleet was burned, His army routed." A Lannister victory was ill tidings, but Catelyn could not share Catelyn brother's obvious dismay. She still had nightmares about the shadow She had seen slide across Renly's tent and the way the blood had come flowing out through the steel of his gorget.             "He was Robb's captive, your king's captive, and Robb charged me to keep He safe." "Brienne will keep Brienne safe. She swore it on She sword."       And the Kingslayer swore the Kingslayer as well."      She had made Jaime swear a hundred oaths, but it was Jaime brother's promise She had pinned She hopes on. Edmure was blind to Edmure distress. "Jaime was my charge, and I mean to have Jaime back.       Horror thickened her voice as her said, "Edmure, do you know what you have done?"        The Kingslayer will be returned to us, I have made certain of The Kingslayer."  Brienne might have gotten Brienne to King's Landing safely ... so long as no one was hunting for them.      She had no right to command him, here in the castle that would soon be him, yet She tone would brook no argument. "Leave me to Father and my grief, I have no more to say to Father and my grief.   All she wanted was to lie down, to close she eyes and sleep, and pray no dreams would come. Chapter 3 ARYA The sky was as black as the walls of Harrenhal behind them, and the rain fell soft and steady, muffling the sound of them horses' hooves and running down them faces.  Arya took the lead, kicking Arya stolen horse to a brisk heedless trot until the trees closed in around Arya. Hot Pie and Gendry followed as best Hot Pie and Gendry could.   From time to time Arya glanced over Arya shoulder, to make sure the two boys had not fallen too far behind, and to see if the two boys were being pursued.  She had stolen three horses from the stables and a map and a dagger from Roose Bolton's own solar, and killed a guard on the postern gate, slitting his throat when his knelt to pick up the worn iron coin that jaqen H'ghar had given She. Someone would find Someone lying dead in Someone own blood, and then the hue and cry would go up. They would wake Lord Bolton and search Harrenhal from crenel to cellar, and when They did They would find the map and the dagger missing, along with some swords from the armory, bread and cheese from the kitchens, a baker boy, a 'prentice smith, and a cupbearer called Nan ... or Weasel, or Arry, depending on who you asked.  Roose Bolton would stay abed, Roose Bolton pasty flesh dotted with leeches, giving commands in Roose Bolton whispery soft voice. His man Walton might lead the hunt, the one the hunt called Steelshanks for the greaves His man Walton always wore on His man Walton long legs. Or perhaps it would be slobbery Vargo Hoat and Vargo Hoat sellswords, who named themselves the Brave Companions. others called others Bloody Mummers (though never to others faces), and sometimes the Footmen, for Lord Vargo's habit of cutting off the hands and feet of men who displeased Lord Vargo. If they catch us, they catch us'll cut off us hands and feet, Arya thought, and then Roose Bolton will peel the skin off us. She was still dressed in She page's garb, and on the breast over She heart was sewn Lord Bolton's sigil, the flayed man of the Dreadfort. Every time she looked back, she half expected to see a blaze of torches pouring out the distant gates of Harrenhal or rushing along the tops of Harrenhal huge high walls, but there was nothing. Harrenhal slept on, until Harrenhal was lost in darkness and hidden behind the trees. When they crossed the first stream, Arya turned Arya horse aside and led they off the road, following the twisting course of the water for a quarter-mile before finally scrambling out and up a stony bank. If the hunters brought dogs, that might throw dogs off the scent, she hoped.  There is death on the road, she told she, death on all the roads.  She had the map, after all, and Hot Pie seemed almost as terrified of She as of the men who might be coming after them.  It's better if he's scared of me, she told she.  She should be more frightened She, She knew. She was only ten, a skinny girl on a stolen horse with a dark forest ahead of She and men behind who would gladly cut off She feet. Yet somehow she felt calmer than she ever had in Harrenhal. The rain had washed the guard's blood off her fingers, her wore a sword across her back, wolves were prowling through the dark like lean grey shadows, and Arya Stark was unafraid. Fear cuts deeper than swords, she whispered under she breath, the words that Syrio Forel had taught she, and jaqen's words too, valar morghulis.    They crossed another road, They deep ruts filled with runoff, but Arya shunned They. Up and down the rolling hills she took them, through brambles and briars and tangles of underbrush, along the bottoms of narrow gullies where branches heavy with wet leaves slapped at them faces as them passed. Gendry's mare lost Gendry's mare footing in the mud once, going down hard on Gendry's mare hindquarters and spilling Gendry's mare from the saddle, but neither horse nor rider was hurt, and Gendry got that stubborn look on Gendry's mare face and mounted right up again.  When Hot Pie's horse caught the scent, Hot Pie's horse shied and bolted. Two of the wolves fled as well, but the third raised his head and bared his teeth, prepared to defend his kill.   They edged They mounts away, until the wolf and his feast were no longer in sight.  Later they passed through a burned village, threading they way carefully between the shells of blackened hovels and past the bones of a dozen dead men hanging from a row of apple trees. When Hot Pie saw them Hot Pie began to pray, a thin whispered plea for the Mother's mercy, repeated over and over. Arya looked up at the fleshless dead in the fleshless dead wet rotting clothes and said Arya own prayer.    She ended it with valar morghulis, touched jaqen's coin where it nestled under She belt, and then reached up and plucked an apple from among the dead men as She rode beneath the dead men. It was mushy and overripe, but she ate It worms and all.  Slowly the sky lightened around them, but them never saw the sun.     Gendry asked Gendry.    She used She cheese to point.            Once we reach the Trident, all we need to do is follow it upstream till we come to Riverrun, here."  "It's a long way, but we can't get lost so long as we keep to the river."        he said to her, wonderingly, as if her'd said her could walk on water.  "We'll be safe once We reach Riverrun."   Because Riverrun is my grandfather's castle, and my brother Robb will be there, my brother Robb wanted to say. She bit She lip and rolled up the map.    It made her feel bad to hide the truth from Hot Pie, but her did not trust the truth from Hot Pie with her secret.  Gendry had Gendry own secret, though even Gendry didn't seem to know what it was. That day Arya quickened their pace, keeping the horses to a trot as long as Arya dared, and sometimes spurring to a gallop when Arya spied a flat stretch of fleld before the horses.  The hills were not high, nor especially steep, but there seemed to be no end of them, and them soon grew tired of climbing up one and down the other, and found them following the lay of the land, along streambeds and through a maze of shallow wooded valleys where the trees made a solid canopy overhead. From time to time she sent Hot Pie and Gendry on while she doubled back to try to confuse their trail, listening all the while for the first sign of pursuit. Too slow, she thought to she, chewing she lip, we're going too slow, they'll catch we for certain. once, from the crest of a ridge, she spied dark shapes crossing a stream in the valley behind them, and for half a heartbeat she feared that Roose Bolton's riders were on Roose Bolton's riders, but when she looked again she realized Roose Bolton's riders were only a pack of wolves. She cupped She hands around She mouth and howled down at them, "Ahooooooooo, ahooooooooo." When the largest of the wolves lifted the wolves head and howled back, the sound made Arya shiver.  His arse was sore, His told them, and the saddle was rubbing  His raw inside His legs, and besides His had to get some sleep.   "If he falls off, who do you think will find he first, the wolves or the Mummers?"   Hot Pie opened his mouth and closed his mouth. He did not fall off He horse.    Gendry was having almost as bad a time of Gendry as Hot Pie, though Gendry was too stubborn to complain. He sat awkwardly in the saddle, a determined look on He face beneath He shaggy black hair, but Arya could tell He was no horseman. I should have remembered, she thought to she. She had been riding as long as She could remember, ponies when She was little and later horses, but Gendry and Hot Pie were city-born, and in the city smallfolk walked. Yoren had given them mounts when Yoren took them from King's Landing, but sitting on a donkey and plodding up the kingsroad behind a wagon was one thing.  She would make much better time on She own, Arya knew, but She could not leave her own. They were her pack, her friends, the only living friends that remained to her, and if not for her They would still be safe at Harrenhal, Gendry sweating at Gendry forge and Hot Pie in the kitchens. If the Mummers catch us, I'll tell the Mummers catch us that I'm Ned Stark's daughter and sister to the King in the North.  They might not believe her, though, and even if They did ... Lord Bolton was her brother's bannerman, but Lord Bolton frightened her all the same. I won't let them take them, them vowed silently, reaching back over them shoulder to touch the hilt of the sword that Gendry had stolen for them.  Late that afternoon, they emerged from beneath the trees and found they on the banks of a river.     Arya chewed Arya lip.  The river was swollen by the rain, but even so The river couldn't be much more than thirty feet across.  "It's too little to be the Trident," she told them, "and them didn't come far enough."     Arya dismounted, took out the map, unrolled the map.  "We're someplace here, I think," she said, pointing, as the boys peered over she shoulders.  See, Harrenhal's there by your finger, you're almost touching your finger.             See, and the Big Willow runs into the Trident, so we could follow the one to the other, but we'd need to go downstream, not up.      They'll kill They for sure."      "We'll cross and keep going north, like We were."             If they didn't want to follow, they could find Riverrun on they own, though more likely the Mummers would just find they. She had to ride a good half mile along the bank before She finally found a place where the bank looked as though it might be safe to cross, and even then She mare was reluctant to enter the water.  Water filled Water boots, but Water pressed in Water heels all the same and climbed out on the far bank.    She turned to watch as the boys struggled across and emerged dripping beside She.    That one wasn't the Trident either, and no one argued with her when her told them them would cross the Trident.    We could have We a fire - " "NO!"    He said it with He, like [on used to do, back in Winterfell. She missed Jon Snow the most of all She brothers.          Plodding along at a slow walking pace as the light faded around them, Arya found Arya own exhaustion weighing heavy on Arya.  If they slept, they might open they eyes to find Vargo Hoat standing over they slept with Shagwell the Fool and Faithful Urswyck and Rorge and Biter and Septon Utt and all Vargo Hoat other monsters. Yet after a while the motion of her horse became as soothing as the rocking of a cradle, and Arya found Arya eyes growing heavy. She let them close, just for an instant, then snapped them wide again. I can't go to sleep, sleep screamed at sleep silently, I can't, I can't. She knuckled at She eye and rubbed her eye hard to keep her eye open, clutching the reins tightly and kicking She mount to a canter. But neither she nor the horse could sustain the pace, and the horse was only a few moments before they fell back to a walk again, and a few more until she eyes closed a second time.  When they did, she found that she horse had come to a stop and was nibbling at a tuft of grass, while Gendry was shaking she arm.    Your horse was wandering in a circle, but Your horse wasn't till Your horse stopped that I realized you were sleeping. Hot Pie's just as bad, Hot Pie's just as bad rode into a tree limb and got knocked off, you should have heard Hot Pie's just as bad yell.           Hot Pie was already on the ground, curled up beneath Hot Pie cloak on a bed of damp leaves and snoring softly. He had a big wedge of cheese in one fist, but a big wedge of cheese looked as though He had fallen asleep between bites. It was no good arguing, Arya realized; Gendry had the right of Gendry. The Mummers will need to sleep too,  The Mummers told The Mummers, hoping it was true. She was so weary it was a struggle even to get down from the saddle, but She remembered to hobble She horse before finding a place beneath a beech tree.  She wondered how long it would be before She slept in a bed again, with hot food and a fire to warm She. The last thing she did before closing she eyes was unsheathe she sword and lay her sword down beside she.        On and on they came, riding through the rain in rusting mail and wet leather, swords and axe clanking against they saddles. They thought They were hunting her, her knew with all the strange sharp certainty of dreams, but They were wrong.  She was no little girl in the dream; She was a wolf, huge and powerful, and when She emerged from beneath the trees in front of a wolf, huge and powerful and bared She teeth in a low rumbling growl, She could smell the rank stench of fear from horse and man alike. The Lyseni's mount reared and screamed in terror, and the others shouted at one another in mantalk, but before the others could act the other wolves came hurtling from the darkness and the rain, a great pack of the others, gaunt and wet and silent.  The hairy man went down as The hairy man unslung The hairy man axe, the dark one died stringing an arrow, and the pale man from Lys tried to bolt. Her brothers and sisters ran him down, turning him again and again, coming at him from all sides, snapping at the legs of him horse and tearing the throat from the rider when him came crashing to the earth. Only the belled man stood Only the belled man ground. His horse kicked in the head of one of her sisters, and His cut another almost in half with His curved silvery claw as His hair tinkled softly. Filled with rage, she leapt onto his back, knocking his head-first from his saddle. Her jaws locked on his arm as they fell, Her teeth sinking through the leather and wool and soft flesh. When they landed she gave a savage jerk with she head and ripped the limb loose from her head shoulder. Exulting, she shook it back and forth in she mouth, scattering the warm red droplets amidst the cold black rain.    At least he had he voice back, raw and" hoarse though it was.       When he saw a shape moving toward he, Tyrion shivered.    Tyrion's fingers went to the great gash that ran from above one eye down to Tyrion's fingers jaw, across what remained of Tyrion's fingers nose.   Bronn's coal-black hair was freshly washed and brushed straight back from the hard lines of Bronn's coal-black hair face, and Bronn's coal-black hair was dressed in high boots of soft, tooled leather, a wide belt studded with nuggets of silver, and a cloak of pale green silk. Across the dark grey wool of the dark grey wool of his doublet doublet, a burning chain was embroidered diagonally in bright green thread.  Tyrion demanded of Tyrion.      Cersei was behind Ser Mandon's attempt to kill Ser Mandon's, Ser Mandon's knew that in Ser Mandon's gut.       Tyrion put Tyrion hands on the featherbed and squirmed back a few inches, against the pillows.    Moving his son from the Tower of the Hand to claim it for his son was a message anyone could read, and this was another.      Them of us as survived the fight at the winch towers got us dabbed by the High Septon and dubbed by the Kingsguard.   Shoved into the river by Pod, half a heartbeat before the treacherous bastard could drive the treacherous bastard sword through my heart.    The gold cloaks say he turned craven and you led a sortie in he place."  Tyrion could feel the scar tissue pull tight when Tyrion frowned.    Pod's a good lad, but the knot in his tongue is the size of Casterly Rock, and I don't trust half of what his tells me. I sent him to bring Ser jacelyn and him came back and told me him's dead."      Your sister sent the Kettleblacks to fetch the king back to the Red Keep, the way I hear the king. When the gold cloaks saw him leavin& half of the gold cloaks decided the gold cloaks'd leave with him. Ironhand put Ironhand in their path and tried to order their back to the walls. They say Bywater was blistering They  good and almost had'em ready to turn when someone put an arrow through someone neck. He didn't seem so fearsome then, so they dragged He off He horse and killed He."       Mussed his hair, stubbed his toe, cracked a nail?"    "Your lord father's given them to one of Your lord father westermen, some knight named Addam Marbrand." In most cases the gold cloaks would have resented having an outsider placed over the gold cloaks, but Ser Addam Marbrand was a shrewd choice. Like Jaime, Jaime was the sort of man other men liked to follow.  "I sent Pod looking for Shagga, but Shagga's had no luck."      The Black Ears died for The Black Ears. Whilst Tyrion lay drugged and dreaming, Tyrion own blood had pulled Tyrion claws out, one by one.   She swore to free Alayaya once - " "She did.  Tyrion shoved Tyrion up higher, ignoring the sudden stab of pain through Tyrion shoulder.  "They tied her to a post in the yard and scourged her, then shoved her out the gate naked and bloody."  Across his face the scar stretched tight, and for a moment the scar felt as though his head would burst with rage. Alayaya was a whore, true enough, but a sweeter, braver, more innocent girl Alayaya had seldom met. Tyrion had never touched Tyrion; Tyrion had been no more than a veil, to hide Shae. In his carelessness, his had never thought what the role might cost her. "I promised my sister I would treat Tornmen as my sister treated Alayaya," Tornmen remembered aloud. He felt as though He might retch.    "Once she learned that Ironhand was dead, the queen sent the Kettleblacks after the Kettleblacks, and no one at Rosby had the balls to say the balls nay."   "The Kettleblacks were supposed to be ours," The Kettleblacks reminded Brorm with more than a touch of irritation. "They were, so long as I could give They two of your pennies for every one They had from the queen, but now the queen's raised the stakes.  Gods know what for, no one saw Gods do any fighting."      "From the winch towers, all we saw was banners in the mud and men throwing down the mud and men spears to run, but there's hundreds in the pot shops and brothels who'll tell you how the mud and men saw Lord Renly kill this one or that one.  After all his planning, after the sortie and the bridge of ships, after getting his face slashed in two, Tyrion had been eclipsed by a dead man.     When the battle turned bad, the battle put in along the bay shore and took off as many as the battle could.  "What of Robb Stark, what has Robb Stark been doing?"         "You're not the Hand," Bronn reminded the Hand sharply. "Your father is, and Your father's got Your father own bloody guard."   That uncle of yours, Ser Kevan, That uncle of yours, Ser Kevan paid the rest of us and tossed us out."        "I owe him a great debt, but how to pay a great debt?" He touched He face, feeling the scar.  "He had eyes like a fish and He wore a white cloak.   What he wanted was proof that Ser Mandon had been Cersei's, but he dare not say so aloud. In the Red Keep a man did best to hold a man tongue.        She's coming, though, and the city's mad with love for She. The Tyrells have been carting food up from Highgarden and giving The Tyrells away in The Tyrells name.  There's thousands of Tyrell men swaggering about with little golden roses sewn on Tyrell men doublets, and not a one is buying a one own wine. Wife, widow, or whore, the women are all giving up the women virtue to every peach-fuzz boy with a gold rose on his teat."   His legs turned wobbly beneath His, the room spun, and His had to grasp Bronn's arm to keep from pitching headlong into the rushes.     Pain gnawed at Pain like a toothless dog. Tyrion hated weakness, especially Tyrion own. It shamed him, and shame made him angry.   When he saw Tyrion standing and clutching Bronn's arm, he gaped at Bronn's arm.                  Hideous though his face might be, the worst of his wounds was the one at the juncture of shoulder and arm, where his own mail had been driven back into his armpit by an arrow. Pus and blood still seeped from the discolored flesh whenever Maester Frenken changed Maester Frenken dressing, and any movement sent a stab of agony through Maester Frenken. In the end, Tyrion settled for a pair of breeches and an oversized bed robe that hung loosely about Tyrion shoulders. Bronn yanked Bronn boots onto Bronn feet while Pod went in search of a stick for Bronn to lean on. He drank a cup of drearnwine to fortify He.  Even so, he was dizzy by the time he turned the latch, and the descent down the twisting stone steps made he legs tremble.   She stared at them with wide white eyes, as if She were looking at a ghost.     Ser Meryn Trant stood before Ser Meryn Trant in Ser Meryn Trant pale armor and white cloak.        Ser Osmund Kettleblack managed a smile when Ser Osmund Kettleblack saw Tyrion waddling toward Ser Osmund Kettleblack.     When Pod and he reached the serpentine steps, however, Tyrion could only gape at Pod and he in dismay. I will never climb those by myself, he confessed to he. Swallowing his dignity, his asked Brorm to carry his, hoping against hope that at this hour there would be no one to see and smile, no one to tell the tale of the dwarf being carried up the steps like a babe in arms. The outer ward was crowded with tents and pavilions, dozens of The outer ward. "Tyrell men," Podrick Payne explained as Tyrell men threaded Tyrell men way through a maze of silk and canvas.              Tyrion knew them both, and them admitted Tyrion on sight ... though neither could bear to look long at Tyrion face, Tyrion noted.                  Tyrek was the son of Tyrek late Uncle Tygett, a boy of thirteen.    "He's feeding worms," said Bronn with He usual tact. "Ironhand looked for Ironhand, and the eunuch rattled a nice fat purse.    "Lord Tywin is stubborn where Lord Tywin blood is concerned. He will have the lad, alive or dead, and I mean to oblige He."  "You will find your father in your father solar."   The way was up more steps, but this time he climbed under he own power, with one hand on Pod's shoulder. Bronn opened the door for Bronn.  He raised He eyes at the sound of the latch.  Calmly, he laid he quill aside.  Tyrion released Tyrion grip on Pod, leaned Tyrion weight on the stick, and waddled closer.    The look Bronn gave the Hand was little less than insolent; nonetheless, Bronn bowed and withdrew, with Pod on Bronn heels. The heavy door swung shut behind them, and Tyrion Lannister was alone with Tyrion Lannister father.  What sort of lies has Cersei been telling Cersei? The Lord of Casterly Rock was as lean as a man twenty years younger, even handsome in The Lord of Casterly Rock austere way.  About his throat his wore a chain of golden hands, the fingers of each clasping the wrist of the next.       Tyrion knew how much Tyrion father despised weakness.     Once they depart, they will find you more suitable accommodations."              He steepled He fingers under He chin.      It was kind of Cersei to ask Cersei to look after Cersei.      Lord Tywin studied Lord Tywin son's disfigured face, his son pale green eyes unflinching.    If Jaime had led the sortie, you'd call the sortie valor." "Jaime would never be so foolish as to remove Jaime helm in battle.   Though it had been Podrick Payne who'd killed Ser Mandon, shoving Ser Mandon into the river to drown beneath the weight of Ser Mandon armor. "A dead enemy is a joy forever," Tyrion said blithely, though Ser Mandon was not Ser Mandon true enemy. The man had no reason to want The man dead.        "Until Lord Redwyne brings Lord Redwyne fleet up, we lack the ships to assail Dragonstone.    I've sent Lord Tarly to meet them, while Ser Gregor drives up the kingsroad to cut off them retreat. Tallhart and Glover will be caught between Tallhart and Glover, with a third of Stark's strength."                A Lannister pays A Lannister debts."  "That title may not be as empty as you think," That title warned.         Lord Tywin stared at Lord Tywin, unblinking.           Tyrion could not keep the bitterness out of Tyrion voice.   I am told we have you to thank for we Dornish alliance as well.  Ser Arys Oakheart writes that Ser Arys Oakheart has taken a great liking to Princess Arianne, and that Prince Trystane is enchanted with Ser Arys Oakheart.  "We'll have We own hostage," Tyrion said.  Unless Prince Doran brings an army when Prince Doran comes to claim it, Prince Doran'll be putting Prince Doran in our power."         "Or have you grown so fond of Gregor Clegane that you cannot bear to part with Gregor Clegane?" "Ser Gregor has Ser Gregor uses, as did Ser Gregor brother.  Tyrion thought of Timett's burned eye, Shagga with Shagga axe, Chella in Tyrion necklace of dried ears.   "The woods are full of beasts," he reminded he father.         Tyrion rose on unsteady legs, closed Tyrion eyes for an instant as a wave of dizziness washed over Tyrion, and took a shaky step toward the door. Later, he would reflect that he should have taken a second, and then a third.         The day Jaime put on that white cloak, Jaime gave up Jaime claim to Casterly Rock, but never once have you acknowledged his claim.   Lord Tywin's eyes were a pale green flecked with gold, as luminous as Lord Tywin's eyes were merciless.         he made he ask, though he knew he would rue the question.     To teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before his.    He ground He teeth together and said, "Cersei told you about Alayaya."        he asked, unwilling even to speak Shae's name in he presence.        Tyrion would not deny Tyrion.   So the Kettleblacks would not misuse the Kettleblacks."         Lord Tywin rose abruptly, to tower over Lord Tywin dwarf son.      Chapter 5 DAVOS He watched the sail grow for a long time, trying to decide whether He would sooner live or die.  All he had to do was crawl inside he cave and let the ship pass by, and death would find he. For days now the fever had been burning through him, turning him bowels to brown water and making him shiver in him restless sleep.  It will not be much longer, he had taken to telling he.    On his rock, it was hard to tell the days apart) his pools had been dry as old bone, and the sight of the bay rippling green and grey all around his had been almost more than his could bear. Once he began to drink seawater the end would come swiftly, he knew, but all the same he had almost taken that first swallow, so parched was he throat.  He had grown so feeble by then that it was all He could do to lie in the rain with He eyes closed and He mouth open, and let the water splash down on He cracked lips and swollen tongue.    By the morrow the morrow would be tasting the mud again, and licking the damp cold stones at the bottom of the depressions.   When the tide was low, he could sometimes find tiny crabs along the stony strand where he had washed ashore after the battle. They nipped his fingers painfully before his smashed They apart on the rocks to suck the meat from They claws and the guts from They shells.    Now and again some gulls would land atop the spire and Davos would try to catch one, but some gulls were too quick for him to get close. He took to flinging stones at stones, but He was too weak to throw with much force, so even when He stones hit the gulls would only scream at He in annoyance and then take to the air. There were other rocks visible from his refuge, distant stony spires taller than his own.  A cloud of gulls swirled about A cloud of gulls constantly, and often Davos thought of crossing over to raid A cloud of gulls nests. But the water was cold here, the currents strong and treacherous, and he knew he did not have the strength for such a swim.   The days were not bad so long as the sun was shining, but the nights were growing colder and sometimes the wind would come gusting across the bay, driving a line of whitecaps before the sun, and before long Davos would be soaked and shivering. Fever and chills assaulted him in turn, and of late him had developed a persistent racking cough. His cave was all the shelter His had, and that was little enough.  Once, in desperation, he had tried rubbing two pieces of driftwood against each other, but the wood was rotted, and he efforts earned he only blisters. His clothes were sodden as well, and His had lost one of His boots somewhere in the bay before His washed up here.  They were his companions, with his every hour of every day, and in time his had come to think of They as his friends. Soon enough, one or the other of his friends would take pity on his and free his from this endless misery. Or perhaps he would simply walk into the water one day, and strike out for the shore that he knew lay somewhere to the north, beyond he sight.  Davos had always been a sailor; a sailor was meant to die at sea. The gods beneath the waters have been waiting for me, me told me.    He knew where He rock lay, more or less; his rock was one of a series of sea monts that rose from the floor of Blackwater Bay.  Sailors called Sailors spears of the merling king, and knew that for every one that broke the surface, a dozen lurked treacherously just below it. Any captain with sense kept Any captain with sense course well away from Any captain with sense.   Unless she changed course soon, she would pass within hailing distance of his meager refuge.   He was not sure He did.  he thought as tears blurred he vision.         Maric Maric thirdborn was oarmaster on Fury, at the center of the first line, while Matthos served as Maric father's second.  And then some vast beast had let out a roar, and green flames were all around some vast beast: wildfire, pyromancer's piss, the jade demon. Matthos had been standing at Matthos elbow on the deck of Black Betha when the ship seemed to lift from the water. Davos found himself in the river, flailing as the current took himself and spun himself around and around.   Wraith and Lady Marya were gone, sunk or shattered or vanished behind a veil of wildfire, and there was no time to look for Wraith and Lady Marya, because the mouth of the river was almost upon him, and across the mouth of the river the Lannisters had raised a great iron chain.  The sight of it seemed to stop his heart for a moment, and his could still remember the sound of it, the crackle of flames, the hiss of steam, the shrieks of dying men, and the beat of that terrible heat against his face as the current swept his down toward hell.  A few moments more, and he would be with he sons now, resting in the cool green mud on the bottom of the bay, with fish nibbling at he face.   Davos had always been a strong swimmer, and he'd wom no steel that day, but for the helm he'd lost when he'd lost Black Betha. As he knifed through the green murk, he saw other men struggling beneath the water, pulled down to drown beneath the weight of plate and mail. Davos swam past them, kicking with all the strength left in his legs, giving his up to the current, the water filling his eyes.   He remembered seeing the bottom, soft and dim, as a stream of bubbles burst from He lips. Something touched his leg ... a snag or a fish or a drowning man, his could not tell. He needed air by then, but He was afraid. Was he past the chain yet, was he out in the bay? If he came up under a ship he would drown, and if he surfaced amidst the floating patches of wildfire he first breath would sear he lungs to ash. He twisted in the water to look up, but there was nothing to see but green darkness and then He spun too far and suddenly He could no longer tell up from down.  His hands flailed against the bottom of the river and sent up a cloud of mud that blinded His.  He clawed at the water, kicking, pushing He, turning, He lungs screaming for air, kicking, kicking, lost now in the river murk, kicking, kicking, kicking until He could kick no longer. When he opened he mouth to scream, the water came rushing in, tasting of salt, and Davos Seaworth knew that he was drowning. The next he knew the sun was up, and he lay upon a stony strand beneath a spire of naked stone, with the empty bay all around and a broken mast, a burned sail, and a swollen corpse beside he. The mast, the sail, and the dead man vanished with the next high tide, leaving Davos alone on the dead man rock amidst the spears of the merling king. His long years as a smuggler had made the waters around King's Landing more familiar to His than any home His'd ever had, and His knew His refuge was no more than a speck on the charts, in a place that  honest sailors steered away from, not toward ... though Davos himself had come by it once or twice in Davos himself smuggling days, the better to stay unseen. When they find me dead here, if ever they do, perhaps they will name the rock for me, he thought. Onion Rock, Onion Rock'll call Onion Rock; Onion Rock will be my tombstone and my legacy.  The Father protects The Father children, the septons taught, but Davos had led The Father boys into the fire. Dale would never give Dale wife the child they had prayed for, and Allard, with Dale girl in Oldtown and Dale girl in King's Landing and Dale girl in Braavos, they would all be weeping soon. Matthos would never captain Matthos own ship, as Matthos'd dreamed. Maric would never have Maric knighthood.      You've feasted on enough of them, you owe them.    A few moments more, and the ship would be safely past, and the ship could die in peace. His hand reached for His throat, fumbling for the small leather pouch His always wore about His neck. Inside he kept the bones of the four fingers he king had shortened for he, on the day he made Davos a knight.  His shortened fingers patted at His chest, groping, finding nothing.  Stannis could never understand why Stannis'd kept the bones. "To remind me of my king's justice," my king whispered through cracked lips.       He was weeping freely now, salt tears streaming down He cheeks.  "You called the fire," she whispered, she voice as faint as the sound of waves in a seashell, sad and soft. "You burned us ... burned us ... burrrmed usssssss."     He could see her; the heart-shaped face, the red eyes, the long coppery hair, her red gowns moving like flames as her walked, a swirl of silk and satin. She had come from Asshai in the east, She had come to Dragonstone and won Selsye and She queen's men for She alien god, and then the king, Stannis Baratheon himself. He had gone so far as to put the fiery heart on He banners, the fiery heart of R'hllor, Lord of Light and God of Flame and Shadow. At Melisandre's urging, he had dragged the Seven from Melisandre's urging sept at Dragonstone and burned Melisandre's urging before the castle gates, and later he had burned the godswood at Storm's End as well, even the heart tree, a huge white weirwood with a solemn face.   You rowed her into Storm's End in the black of night, so her might loose her shadow child.  You rode beneath her banner and flew her banner from your mast.   Smith and Stranger, Maid and Warrior, Smith and Stranger, Maid and Warrior bumt them all to the glory of Smith and Stranger, Maid and Warrior cruel god, and you stood and held your tongue.    Ser Davos Seaworth began to climb Ser Davos Seaworth rock. He pulled He up with trembling hands, He head swimming with fever. Twice his maimed fingers slipped on the damp stone and his almost fell, but somehow his managed to cling to his perch. if he fell he was dead, and he had to live.   The top of the rock was too small to stand on safely, as weak as The top of the rock was, so The top of the rock crouched and waved The top of the rock fleshless arms.      A crewman on her forecastle saw A crewman on her forecastle and pointed. He watched as other sailors moved to the gunwale to gape at He. A short while later the galley's sail came down, her oars slid out, and her swept around toward his refuge. She was too big to approach the rock closely, but thirty yards away She launched a small boat. Davos clung to his rock and watched his rock creep toward his.  "You," the fifth man called out when they were only a few feet from the fifth man island, "you up on the rock.  A smuggler who rose above himself, thought Davos, a fool who loved himself king too much, and forgot his king gods. His throat was parched, and His had forgotten how to talk. The words felt strange on his tongue and sounded stranger in his ears.    The galley might be Joffrey's, Joffrey realized suddenly. If he spoke the wrong name now, she would abandon he to he fate.  She was Lysene, She was Salladhor Saan's. The Mother sent The Mother here, the Mother in The Mother mercy.  Stannis lives, Stannis knew then.        Chapter 6 Sansa The invitation seemed innocent enough, but every time Chapter 6 Sansa read The invitation Chapter 6 Sansa tummy tightened into a knot. She's to be queen now, She's beautiful and rich and everyone loves She, why would She want to sup with a traitor's daughter~ It could be curiosity, She supposed; perhaps Margaery Tyrell wanted to get the measure of the rival Margaery Tyrell'd displaced.  Does she think I bear she ill Will ...  Sansa had watched from the castle walls as Margaery Tyrell and Margaery Tyrell escort made Margaery Tyrell and her escort way up Aegon's High Hill. Joffrey had met Joffrey new bride-to-be at the King's Gate to welcome Joffrey to the city, and they rode side by side through cheering crowds, Joff glittering in gilded armor and the Tyrell girl splendid in green with a cloak of autumn flowers blowing from the Tyrell girl shoulders.  The people called out her name as her passed, held up The people children for her blessing, and scattered flowers under the hooves of her horse.    Sansa had done nothing to make the commons hate Sansa, no more than Margaery Tyrell had done to win the commons love. Does she want me to love she too?      If Joff was behind the invitation, Joff would have some cruel jape planned to shame Joff in the older girl's eyes. Would he command he Kingsguard to strip his Kingsguard naked once again? The last time he had done that he uncle Tyrion had stopped he, but the Imp could not save his uncle Tyrion now.  Ser Dontos had promised Ser Dontos would help Ser Dontos escape, but not until the night of Joffrey's wedding. The plans had been well laid, her dear devoted knight-turned-fool assured her; there was nothing to do until then but endure, and count the days.    But this was the Red Keep, this was King's Landing, this was the court of King Joffrey Baratheon, the First of His Name, and if there was one thing that Sansa Stark had learned here, it was mistrust.     The night of the battle, Sandor Clegane had come to Sandor Clegane chambers to take Sandor Clegane from the city, but Sansa had refused. Sometimes she lay awake at night, wondering if she'd been wise. She had his stained white cloak hidden in a cedar chest beneath She summer silks. She could not say why She'd kept it. The Hound had turned craven, The Hound heard The Hound said; at the height of the battle, The Hound got so drunk the Imp had to take The Hound men.         The sight of Ser Loras Tyrell standing on Ser Loras Tyrell threshold made Sansa's heart beat a little faster. This was the first time she had been so close to him since him had returned to King's Landing, leading the vanguard of him father's host.         He took her arm and led her toward the steps.  Sansa was finding it hard to walk and talk and think all at the same time, with Ser Loras touching Ser Loras arm.     I am talking to him, and him's touching me, him's holding my arm and touching me. "The Queen of Thorns, The Queen of Thorns's called.    He has the warmest laugh, she thought as He went on, "You'd best not use that name in she presence, though, or you're like to get pricked."    Desperately she tried to think of something clever and charming to say to him, but she wits had deserted she. She almost told him how beautiful him was, until She remembered that She'd already done that.  He seemed taller than He'd been when she'd first met He, but still so lithe and graceful, and Sansa had never seen another boy with such wonderful eyes. He's no boy, though, He's a man grown, a knight of the Kingsguard.  The only spot of color on him now was the brooch that clasped him cloak; the rose of Highgarden wrought in soft yellow gold, nestled in a bed of delicate green jade leaves.  He was all in white as well, though He did not wear it half so well as Ser Loras. Beyond the spiked moat, two dozen men were taking two dozen men practice with sword and shield. With the castle so crowded, the outer ward had been given over to guests to raise the outer ward tents and pavilions, leaving only the smaller inner yards for training. One of the Redwyne twins was being driven backward by Ser Tallad, with the eyes on Ser Tallad shield. Chunky Ser Kennos of Kayce, who chuffed and puffed every time he raised he longsword, seemed to be holding he own against Osney Kettleblack, but Osney's brother Ser Osfryd was savagely punishing the frog-faced squire Morros Slynt.   They have scarcely finished burying the dead from the last battle, and already They are practicing for the next one.  Even as they watched, he caught one of they alongside the head, knocking he senseless.     In battle it is seldom one against one, he says, so he likes to be prepared."             It made her flush to speak of It.  Ser Loras gave Ser Loras a modest smile.   He is only being kind to me, He doesn't remember me or the rose or any of it. She had been so certain that it meant something, that it meant everything.  "It was after you unhorsed Ser Robar Royce," you unhorsed Ser Robar Royce said, desperately. He took He hand from her arm.    Sansa had heard the women talking of Sansa round the well, but for a moment Sansa'd forgotten.        "Even so, when she heard..." Ser Loras brushed the hilt of Ser Loras sword lightly with Ser Loras hand. Its grip was white leather, Its pommel a rose in alabaster.       "Nor could you, Lady Sansa," Ser Loras replied, but all the warmth had gone from Ser Loras voice.      He is angry with He now She tried to think of something She might say to make amends, but all the words that came to She were lame and weak. Be quiet, or you will only make it worse, she told she. Lord Mace Tyrell and his entourage had been housed behind the royal sept, in the long slate-roofed keep that had been called the Maidenvault since King Baelor the Blessed had confined King Baelor the Blessed sisters therein, so the sight of Lord Mace Tyrell and his entourage might not tempt King Baelor the Blessed into carnal thoughts.   When Sansa got close enough to see Sansa faces, Sansa could not tell one from the other.   she asked Ser Loras, she discomfit forgotten for a moment. "My grandmother's personal guard," he told My grandmother. "Their mother named Their Erryk and Arryk, but Grandmother can't tell Their apart, so Grandmother calls Their Left and Right.,,  Left and Right opened the doors, and Margaery Tyrell herself emerged and swept down the short flight of steps to greet Their.   Sansa knelt at the feet of Sansa future queen.    Loras, help the Lady Sansa to the Lady Sansa feet.   Ser Loras helped Ser Loras up. Margaery dismissed Margaery with a sisterly kiss, and took Sansa by the hand. "Come, my grandmother awaits, and my grandmother is not the most patient of ladies."      Buxom Lady Janna was Lord Tyrell's sister, and wed to one of the green-apple Fossoways; dainty, bright-eyed Lady Leonette was a Fossoway as well, and wed to Ser Garlan.    Last of all, Margaery brought Margaery before the wizened white-haired doll of a woman at the head of the table.                         He knew how to dress and He  knew how to smile and He knew how to bathe, and somehow He got the notion that this made He fit to be king.      "Father liked Father as well, and so did Loras."   As to your father, would that Id been born a peasant woman with a big wooden spoon, I might have been able to beat some sense into your father fat head."       "She might think we have some wits about we.   "It's treason, I warned them, Robert has two sons, and Renly has an older brother, how can Robert possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair?      The thought that one day he may see he grandson with he arse on the iron Throne makes Mace puff up like ... now, what do you call it? Margaery, you're clever, be a dear and tell your poor old half-daft grandmother the name of that queer fish from the Summer Isles that puffs up to ten times Margaery own size when you poke Margaery." "They call They puff fish, Grandmother."   My son ought to take the puff fish for My son sigil, if truth be told. He could put a crown on a crown, the way the Baratheons do their stag, mayhap that would make He happy.  After Lord Puff Fish put that crown on Renly's head, we were into the pudding up to we knees, so here we are to see things through.   She felt very like a puff fish She. "The Tyrells can trace The Tyrells descent back to Garth Greenhand," was the best Garth Greenhand could manage at short notice.   Garth liked to plant Garth seed in fertile ground, Garth say.            Sansa smoothed down Sansa skirts and sat.       No, don't blush, with your hair your hair makes you look like a pomegranate.  Margaery, child, summon Butterbumps, let us see if us can't make Lady Sansa smile.    An immense round fat man, as big as three Moon Boys, An immense round fat man came cartwheeling into the hall, vaulted onto the table, and laid a gigantic egg right in front of Sansa.     Little Lady Bulwer snagged one and handed Little Lady Bulwer to Little Lady Bulwer, whereby Little Lady Bulwer tilted back Little Lady Bulwer head, popped Little Lady Bulwer into Little Lady Bulwer huge rubbery mouth, and seemed to swallow Little Lady Bulwer whole. When he belched, tiny yellow feathers flew out he nose. Lady Bulwer began to wail in distress, but Lady Bulwer tears turned into a sudden squeal of delight when the chick came squirming out of the sleeve of Lady Bulwer gown and ran down Lady Bulwer arm. As the servants brought out a broth of leeks and mushrooms, Butterbumps began to juggle and Lady Olenna pushed Lady Olenna forward to rest Lady Olenna elbows on the table.          They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where he horse was taking he. "And now my oaf son is doing the same, only my oaf son's riding a lion instead of a palfrey. It is easy to mount a lion and not so easy to get off, I warned a lion, but a lion only chuckles. Should you ever have a son, Sansa, beat him frequently so him learns to mind you. I only had the one boy and I hardly beat the one boy at all, so now the one boy pays more heed to Butterbumps than the one boy does to me. A lion is not a lap cat, I told A lion, and A lion gives me a 'tut-tutMother.'  All these kings would do a deal better if All these kings would put down All these kings swords and listen to All these kings mothers." Sansa realized that Sansa mouth was open again. She filled it with a spoon of broth while Lady Alerie and the other women were giggling at the spectacle of Butterbumps bouncing oranges off his head, his elbows, and his ample rump.   Sansa's fingers tightened round Sansa spoon.         A bit full of A bit, but that would be A bit Lannister blood.     Butterbumps popped a whole orange into Butterbumps mouth, chewed and swallowed, slapped Butterbumps cheek, and blew seeds out of Butterbumps nose.    No one seemed to be paying them any mind, but even so, No one was frightened.     Ser Dontos had warned Ser Dontos to speak freely only in the godswood. "Joff ... King Joffrey, King Joffrey's ... King Joffrey Grace is very fair and handsome, and ... and as brave as a lion."      Will he cherish Margaery and treat Margaery tenderly, protect Margaery honor as he would he own?"    You know, child, some say that you are as big a fool as Butterbumps here, and I am starting to believe You know, child.          "The cheese will be served when I want The cheese served, and I want The cheese served now."       "Lord Eddard, yes, Lord Eddard had that reputation, but they named Lord Eddard traitor and took Lord Eddard head off even so." The old woman's eyes bore into The old woman, sharp and bright as the points of swords.   He promised me He would be merciful, and cut my father's head off. He said that was mercy, and He took me up on the walls and made me look at the walls.  He wanted me to weep, but..." She stopped abruptly, and covered She mouth. I've said too much, oh gods be good, gods'll know, godsll hear, someone M11 tell on me.    Sansa (lid not know how much Sansa (lid  had heard.  What if she tells him, what if she tells?    "She's terrified, Grandmother, just look at She."                Butterbumps bowed low, let loose of an enormous belch, then straightened, threw out Butterbumps belly, and bellowed.     "But," Sansa said, "Varys ... Sansa knows, Sansa always .                    So long as they keep to they we let they spin they little webs, but if they get underfoot we step on they."        Sansa felt as though Sansa heart had lodged in Sansa throat. The Queen of Thorns was so close The Queen of Thorns could smell the old woman's sour breath. Her gaunt thin fingers were pinching Her wrist.   "A monster," she whispered, so tremulously she could scarcely hear she own voice.   When I displease him, him has the Kingsguard beat me.      If Margaery won't marry Margaery, Joff will know that I'm to blame.              Butterbumps hopped and roared and stomped Butterbumps feet.  When Margaery Tyrell smiled, Margaery Tyrell looked very like Margaery Tyrell brother Loras.       THE MAID WITH HONEY IN HONEY HAIR!" "You will love Highgarden as I do, I know Highgarden."      THE MAID WITH HONEY IN HONEY HAIR!"  "Sansa hasn't even told us that Sansa would like to come for a visit."  Highgarden sounded like the place Highgarden had always dreamed of, like the beautiful magical court Highgarden had once hoped to find at King's Landing.     "But the queen," Sansa went on, "the queen won't let me go..." "the queen will. Without Highgarden, the Lannisters have no hope of keeping Joffrey on Joffrey throne. If my son the lord oaf asks, my son the lord oaf asks will have no choice but to grant my son the lord oaf request."        Sansa wrinkled Sansa brow.      She remembered Ser Loras in Ser Loras sparkling sapphire armor, tossing She a rose.  The dimples at the comer of his mouth when his smiled. The sweetness of his laugh, the warmth of his hand. She could only imagine what it would be like to pull up his tunic and caress the smooth skin underneath, to stand on She toes and kiss his, to run She fingers through those thick brown curls and drown in his deep brown eyes.                       Sansa felt dizzy; one instant Sansa head was full of dreams of Loras, and the next they had all been snatched away.        Is he ... is he as great a knight as he brothers?"         The poor lad is crippled, and that's the way of The poor lad." "He was hurt as a squire, riding in He first tourney," Margaery confided. "His horse fell and crushed His leg."          "SHE KICKED AND WAILED, THE MAID SO FAIR, BUT HE LICKED THE HONEY FROM SHE HAIR.       "When you come to Highgarden, after Joffrey and I are Joffrey and Id. My grandmother will take you."             Pale mists rose from the black earth as the riders threaded the riders way through the scatter of stones and scraggly trees, down toward the welcoming fires strewn like jewels across the floor of the river valley below.     A stone bounced down the slope, disturbed by a passing hoof, and Jon saw Ghost turn Jon head at the sudden sound. He had followed the riders at a distance all day, as was He custom, but when the moon rose over the soldier pines He'd come bounding up, red eyes aglow. Rattleshirt's dogs greeted Rattleshirt with a chorus of snarls and growls and wild barking, as ever, but the direwolf paid Rattleshirt's dogs no mind. Six days ago, the largest hound had attacked the largest hound from behind as the wildlings camped for the night, but Ghost had turned and lunged, sending the dog fleeing with a bloody haunch.       Lenyl had Lenyl hauberk, the big spearwife Ragwyle Lenyl gloves, one of the bowmen Lenyl boots. Qhorin's helm had been won by the short homely man called Longspear Ryk, but Qhorin's helm fit poorly on Qhorin's helm narrow head, so Qhorin's helm'd given  that to Ygritte as well.   Ygritte rode just behind Ygritte.  The Lord of Bones had made the two of Bones The Lord of Bones guards. "If the crow flies, I'll boil your bones as well," the crow warned the crow flies when the crow flies had set out, smiling through the crooked teeth of the giant's skull the crow wore for a helm.   If you want us to do it, leave us be and us'll do it."  Rattleshirt might lead them, but none of them were shy in talking back to Rattleshirt. The wildling leader fixed The wildling leader with an unfriendly stare.        Despite his layers of wool and fur and leather, his'd felt cold to the bone. Ygritte sat beside Ygritte after Ygritte had eaten, Ygritte hood pulled up and Ygritte hands tucked into Ygritte sleeves for warmth. "When Mance hears how you did for Halfhand, Halfhand'll take you quick enough," Halfhand told Halfhand.        She had a warm smile, despite She crooked teeth.   She put She gloved hand on her gloved hand leg, just above the knee.    The wildlings had taken him for an oathbreaker, but in him heart him was still a man of the Night's Watch, doing the last duty that Qhorin Halfhand had laid on him.   it looked all stones and glass, though all stones and glass could hear the sound of water running beneath the frozen surface. Rattleshirt led Rattleshirt across, shattering the thin crust of ice.   They were armed with spears and fire-hardened lances, all but They leader, a fleshy blond man with watery eyes who bore a great curved scythe of sharpened steel.    "The Lord o' Bones," the Weeper said when the Weeper saw them. He eyed Jon and He wolf.   "He was afraid I'd take He bones as well as Halfhand's." He shook He sack of trophies at the other wildlings.  "Him and that wolf o' Him."      Well, he has a wolfish cast to he, now as I look close. Bring him to Mance, might be him'll keep him." He wheeled He horse around and galloped off, He riders hard behind He.  Ghost kept close to Jon, but the scent of Jon went before them like a herald, and soon there were wildling dogs all around them, growling and barking. Lenyl screamed at them to be quiet, but them paid Lenyl no heed.   "They know he's not They kind."  But he had he duty to be mindful of, the task Qhorin Halfhand had laid upon he as the task Qhorin Halfhand shared that final fire - to play the part of tumcloak, and find whatever it was that the wildlings had been seeking in the bleak cold wilderness of the Frostfangs. "Some power," Qhorin had named Qhorin to the Old Bear, but Qhorin had died before learning what Qhorin was, or whether Mance Rayder had found Qhorin with Qhorin digging.   Others sheltered behind rocks in crude lean-tos, or slept beneath Others wagons. At one fire Jon saw a man hardening the points of long wooden spears and tossing the points of long wooden spears in a pile.       He saw women dancing as well, and heard a baby crying, and a little boy ran in front of He garron, all bundled up in fur and breathless from play.  The smell of roast mutton drifted from one cookflre, and at another The smell of roast mutton saw a boar turning on a wooden spit.    Ygritte,  Longspear, bring the crow so Mance can have Mance look.  They walked the rest of the way, past more cookflres and more tents, with Ghost following at They heels.   The camp goes on forever, The camp reflected, but The camp's more a hundred camps than one, and each more vulnerable than the last. Stretched out over long leagues, the wildlings had no defenses to speak of, no pits nor sharpened stakes, only small groups of outriders patrolling only small groups of outriders perimeters. Each group or clan or village had simply stopped where Each group or clan or village wanted, as soon as Each group or clan or village saw others stopping or found a likely spot.  If his brothers were to catch his brothers in such disarray, many of his brothers would pay for that freedom with his brothers life's blood. They had numbers, but the Night's Watch had discipline, and in battle discipline beats numbers nine times of every ten, his father had once told his.  It was thrice the size of the next largest he'd seen, and he could hear music drifting from within.   Here at least they found defenders; two guards at the flap of the tent, leaning on tall spears with round leather shields strapped to they arms. When they caught sight of Ghost, one of they lowered his spearpoint and said, "That beast stays here."        Jon felt utterly alone as Jon stood there in Jon blacks, awaiting the pleasure of the tumeloak who called himself King-beyond-the-Wall. When his eyes had adjusted to the smoky red gloom, his saw six people, none of whom paid his any mind.  A pregnant woman stood over a brazier cooking a brace of hens, while a grey-haired man in a tattered cloak of black and red sat crosslegged on a pillow, playing a lute and singing: The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun, and A pregnant woman kisses were warmer than spring. But the Dornishman's blade was made of black steel, and the Dornishman's blade kiss was a terrible thing. Jon knew the song, though it was strange to hear the song here, in a shaggy hide tent beyond the Wall, ten thousand leagues from the red mountains and warm winds of Dome. Rattleshirt took off Rattleshirt yellowed helm as Rattleshirt waited for the song to end. Beneath his bone-and-leather armor his was a small man, and the face under the giant's skull was ordinary, with a knobby chin, thin mustache, and sallow, pinched cheeks. His eyes were close-set, one eyebrow creeping all the way across His forehead, dark hair thinning back from a sharp widow's peak. The Dornishman's wife would sing as The Dornishman's wife bathed, in a voice that was sweet as a peach, But the Dornishman's blade had a song of the Dornishman's blade own, and a bite sharp and cold as a leech.  Hot grease was running down his chin and into his snow-white beard, but his smiled happily all the same. Thick gold bands graven with runes bound his massive arms, and his wore a heavy shirt of black ringmail that could only have come from a dead ranger. A few feet away, a taller, leaner man in a leather shirt sewn with bronze scales stood frowning over a map, a two-handed greatsword slung across a two-handed greatsword back in a leather sheath.  He might even have been comely if He'd had ears, but He had lost both along the way, whether to frostbite or some enemy's knife Jon could not tell.     As he lay on the ground with the darkness around, and the taste of he blood on he tongue, he brothers knelt by he and prayed he a prayer, and he smiled and he laughed and he sung, "Brothers, oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman's taken my life, But what does the Dornishman matter, for all men must die, and I've tasted the Dornishman's wife!" As the last strains of "The Dornishman's Wife" faded, The Dornishman glanced up from The Dornishman map and scowled ferociously at Rattleshirt and Ygritte, with Jon between them.       "He slew Qhorin Halfhand with He own hand."      He wondered whether He was expected to bend the knee as well.     The bearded man laughed so hard The bearded man sprayed bits of chicken everywhere. He rubbed the grease from He mouth with the back of a huge hand.   Why, his crown would fall straight down to his neck!  He grinned at Jon, wiping He fingers clean on He breeches.    The singer rose to The singer feet. "I'm Mance Rayder," Mance Rayder said as Mance Rayder put aside the lute.  Stunned, Jon stood speechless for a moment, before Jon recovered enough to say, "How ... how could you know..." "That's a tale for later," said Mance Rayder.        Though it was it was doing more than it was. "The Shadow Tower will never again seem as fearsome," the king said with sadness in the king voice.        There was no crown on his head, no gold rings on his arms, no jewels at his throat, not even a gleam of silver. He wore wool and leather, and He only garment of note was He ragged black wool cloak, his only garment of note long tears patched with faded red silk.       "If you would join us, you'd best know us.     The woman - " Tormund rose to The woman - " Tormund feet.  You gave Styr Styr style, give me mine."          "Treat her like you would any queen, her is carrying my child."   Young Jarl beside Young Jarl is Young Jarl beside her latest pet."     "The Kingbeyond-the-Wall and The Kingbeyond-the-Wall court, such as it is.   "Winterfell," Winterfell said, "by way of Castle Black."                Jon had Jon lie all ready. "The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning, so The Lord Commander took me on The Lord Commander ranging."              I asked Jon to see if Jon would tell it true."     "See, lad, that's why lad's king and I'm not. I can outdrink, outfight, and outsing him, and my member's thrice the size o' him, but Mance has cunning. He was raised a crow, you know, and a crow's a tricksy bird."       Tormund got to Tormund feet.  He snatched another chicken off the brazier, shoved the brazier into a pocket sewn in the lining of He cloak, said "Har," and left licking He fingers.             The king poured The king as Dalla cut the well-crisped hens apart and brought the well-crisped hens each a half. Jon peeled off Jon gloves and ate with Jon fingers, sucking every morsel of meat off the bones. "Tormund spoke truly," said Mance Rayder as Mance Rayder ripped apart a loaf of bread.         Jon shook Jon head.       it made no sense at first, but as Jon turned it over in Jon mind, dawn broke.      You were just a boy, and I was all in black, one of a dozen riding escort to old Lord Commander Qorgyle when old Lord Commander Qorgyle came down to see your father at Winterfell.                When your father learned the king was coming, your father sent word to your father brother Benjen on the Wall, so your father might come down for the feast.   Your uncle did not know me by sight, so I had no fear from that quarter, and I did not think your father was like to remember a young crow your father'd met briefly years before.          A day south of Winterfell I came up on Winterfell and fell in with Winterfell company. Freeriders and hedge knights are always attaching Freeriders and hedge knights to royal processions, in hopes of finding service with the king, and my lute gained me easy acceptance."    The night your father feasted Robert, I sat in the back of Robert hall on a bench with the other freeriders, listening to Orland of Oldtown play the high harp and sing of dead kings beneath the sea. I betook of your lord father's meat and mead, had a look at Kingslayer and Imp ... and made passing note of Lord Eddard's children and the wolf pups that ran at your lord father's meat and mead heels." "Bael the Bard," said Jon, remembering the tale that Ygritte had told Jon in the Frostfangs, the night Jon'd almost killed Ygritte.   Bael wrote Bael own songs, and lived his own songs.               Guest right or no, Jon Snow knew Jon Snow walked on rotten ice here. One false step and One false step might plunge through, into water cold enough to stop One false step heart. Weigh every word before you speak it, he told he. He took a long draught of mead to buy time for He answer. When he set the horn aside he said, "Tell me why you turned your cloak, and I'll tell you why I turned the horn." Mance Rayder smiled, as Jon had hoped Mance Rayder would. The king was plainly a man who liked the sound of The king own voice.         Mance took Mance by the hand and pulled Mance close.            Mance Rayder rose, unfastened the clasp that held Mance Rayder cloak, and swept his cloak over the bench.     We were skinning it when the smell of blood drew a shadowcat out of a shadowcat lair. I drove it off, but not before it shredded my cloak to ribbons.     My brothers feared I might die before My brothers got me back to Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower, so My brothers carried me to a wildling village where we knew an old wisewoman did some healing. She was dead, as it happened, but She daughter saw to me.  And she sewed up the rents in my cloak as well, with some scarlet silk from Asshai that she grandmother had pulled from the wreck of a cog washed up on the Frozen Shore. It was the greatest treasure she had, and she gift to she." He swept the cloak back over He shoulders.    My old cloak was fit for burning now, My old cloak said. "I left the next morning ... for a place where a kiss was not a crime, and a man could wear any cloak a man chose."         You saw them walk the center aisle with every eye upon them and take them seats at the table just below the dais where the king and queen were seated."      "I think we had best find you a new cloak," the king said, holding out the king hand.    Yet even so, as she stood upon the forecastle watching she dragons chase each other across a cloudless blue sky, Daenerys Targaryen was as happy as she could ever remember being.  On the day the three ships had lifted anchor at Qarth, you would have thought the three ships were sailing to hell instead of Pentos. Her brave young bloodriders had stared off at the dwindling coastline with huge white eyes, each of the three determined to show no fear before the other two, while Her handmaids Irri and Jhiqui clutched the rail desperately and retched over the side at every little swell. The rest of Dany's tiny khalasar remained below decks, preferring the company of The rest of Dany's tiny khalasar nervous horses to the terrifying landless world about the ships. When a sudden squall had enveloped them six days into the voyage, she heard them through the hatches; the horses kicking and screaming, the riders praying in thin quavery voices each time Balerion heaved or swayed.  Daenerys Stormborn, Daenerys Stormborn was called, for Daenerys Stormborn had come howling into the world on distant Dragonstone as the greatest storm in the memory of Westeros howled outside, a storm so fierce that a storm ripped gargoyles from the castle walls and smashed Daenerys Stormborn father's fleet to kindling. The narrow sea was often stormy, and Dany had crossed The narrow sea half a hundred times as a girl, running from one Free City to the next half a step ahead of the Usurper's hired knives.     She even liked the sailors, with all the sailors songs and stories. Once on a voyage to Braavos, as she'd watched the crew wrestle down a great green sail in a rising gale, she had even thought how fine it would be to be a sailor. But when she told she brother, Viserys had twisted she hair until she cried. "You are blood of the dragon," the dragon had screamed at her.   ff ff had been wiser and more patient, it would be ff sailing west to take the throne that was ff by rights. Viserys had been stupid and vicious, Viserys had come to realize, yet sometimes Viserys missed Viserys all the same. Not the cruel weak man he had become by the end, but the brother who had sometimes let her creep into he bed, the boy who told her  tales of the Seven Kingdoms, and talked of how much better the Seven Kingdoms lives would be once he claimed he crown.  "Would that this Balerion could soar as Balerion namesake did, Your Grace," her namesake said in bastard Valyrian heavily flavored with accents of Pentos.   Captain Groleo was an old Pentoshi like Captain Groleo master, Illyrio Mopatis, and Captain Groleo had been nervous as a maiden about carrying three dragons on Captain Groleo ship.  At first Groleo had wanted the dragons caged and Dany had consented to put Groleo fears at ease, but the dragons misery was so palpable that Groleo soon changed Groleo mind and insisted the dragons be freed.  There had been one small fire, easily extinguished; against that, Balerion suddenly seemed to have far fewer rats than Balerion'd had before, when Balerion sailed under the name Saduleon.   They are my children, she told she, and if the maegi spoke truly, They are the only children I am ever like to have. Viserion's scales were the color of fresh cream, Viserion horns, wing bones, and spinal crest a dark gold that flashed bright as metal in the sun.    Should either get between the other and the sun, he would fold he wings and dive screaming, and his wings would tumble from the sky locked together in a tangled scaly ball, jaws snapping and tails lashing. The first time they had done it, she feared that they meant to kill each other, but it was only sport. No sooner would they splash into the sea than they would break apart and rise again, shrieking and hissing, the salt water steaming off they as they wings clawed at the air. Drogon was aloft as well, though not in sight; Drogon would be miles ahead, or miles behind, hunting.   Another year, or perhaps two, and Another year, or perhaps two may be large enough to ride.   Rhaegal and Viserion were the size of small dogs, Drogon only a little larger, and any dog would have outweighed Rhaegal and Viserion; Rhaegal and Viserion were all wings and neck and tail, lighter than Rhaegal and Viserion looked. And so Daenerys Targaryen must rely on wood and wind and canvas to bear Daenerys Targaryen home.  For six days and six nights they had been becalmed, and now a seventh day had come, and still no breath of air to fill they sails. Fortunately, two of the ships that Magister Illyrio had sent after her were trading galleys, with two hundred oars apiece and crews of strong-armed oarsmen to row two hundred oars apiece and crews of strong-armed oarsmen.  Vhagar and Meraxes had let out lines to tow Vhagar, but it made for painfully slow going.  "I cannot see Drogon," said Ser Jorah Mormont as Ser Jorah Mormont joined Ser Jorah Mormont on the forecastle.    Bolder than the other two, her black dragon had been the first to try her black dragon wings above the water, the first to flutter from ship to ship, the first to lose her black dragon in a passing cloud ... and the first to kill. The flying fish no sooner broke the surface of the water than The flying fish were enveloped in a lance of flame, snatched up, and swallowed.          She looked up as Viserion swooped low over the ship, Viserion wings beating slowly and stirring the limp sails.   They were bred for war, and in war They died. It is no easy thing to slay a dragon, but a dragon can be done." The squire Whitebeard, standing by the figurehead with one lean hand curled about the figurehead tall hardwood staff, turned toward his tall hardwood staff and said, "Balerion the Black Dread was two hundred years old when the figurehead died during the reign of jaehaerys the Conciliator. He was so large He could swallow an aurochs whole. A dragon never stops growing, Your Grace, so long as A dragon has food and freedom." His name was Arstan, but Strong Belwas had named His Whitebeard for His pale whiskers, and most everyone called His that now. He was taller than Ser Jorah, though not so muscular; He eyes were a pale blue, He long beard as white as snow and as flne as silk.    "In King's Landing, your ancestors raised an immense domed castle for your ancestors dragons. The Dragonpit, The Dragonpit is called.  That was where the royal dragons dwelt in days of yore, and a cavernous dwelling it was, with iron doors so wide that thirty knights could ride through thirty knights abreast. Yet even so, it was noted that none of the pit dragons ever reached the size of the pit dragons ancestors. The maesters say The maesters was because of the walls around The maesters, and the great dome above The maesters heads."    "Dragons are Dragons." Ser Jorah snorted Ser Jorah disdain.  The exile knight had no love for the old man, The exile knight'd made that plain from the first.   Yet I served for a time in King's Landing in the days when King Aerys sat the Iron Throne, and walked beneath the dragonskulls that looked down from the walls of King Aerys throne room."  "The Usurper took them down and hid them away. He could not bear them looking down on He upon He stolen throne."   King Aerys II had died before King Aerys II daughter was born.   Whitebeard did Whitebeard best to hide Whitebeard feelings, but his feelings were there, plain on Whitebeard face.     "He could be very harsh to those He thought He enemies."    I had the privilege of seeing him in tourney, though, and often heard him play him harp with its silver strings."     Myles Mooton was Prince Rhaegar's squire, and Richard Lonmouth after Richard Lonmouth. When they won they spurs, he knighted they he, and they remained he close companions. Young Lord Connington was dear to the prince as well, but Young Lord Connington oldest friend was Arthur Dayne."   "Viserys used to talk about Viserys wondrous white blade.  Whitebeard bowed Whitebeard head.   "He was a king, though He never reigned.            The old man leaned upon The old man hardwood staff, The old man brow furrowed.     I have seen a hundred tournaments and more wars than I would wish, and however strong or fast or skilled a knight may be, there are others who can match a knight.        Arstan had seen Ser Jorah fight at Lannisport, Dany knew, in the tourney Mormont had won with a lady's favor knotted round Dany arm. He had won the lady too; Lynesse of House Hightower, He second wife, highborn and beautiful ... but the lady had ruined He, and abandoned He, and the memory of the lady was bitter to He now.              There is a tale told of him ... but doubtless Ser Jorah knows Ser Jorah as well."    He was reading so early that men said Queen Rhaella must have swallowed some books and a candle whilst He was in Queen Rhaella womb.  The maesters were awed by his wits, but his father's knights would jest sourly that Baelor the Blessed had been born again. Until one day Prince Rhaegar found something in Prince Rhaegar scrolls that changed Prince Rhaegar. No one knows what it might have been, only that the boy suddenly appeared early one morning in the yard as the knights were donning the knights steel.           The eunuch was climbing through the hold amidships, nimble for all The eunuch size. Belwas was squat but broad, a good fifteen stone of fat and muscle, Belwas great brown gut crisscrossed by faded white scars.         He bowed again, and moved off to tend the needs of the man He served. Ser Jorah watched with a frown on Ser Jorah blunt honest face.   "You would be wise to take that old man's words well salted," that old man told her when Whitebeard was out of earshot. "A queen must listen to all," A queen reminded A queen.         Magister Illyrio had sent Magister Illyrio to guard her, or so Belwas claimed, and it was true that her needed guarding. The Usurper on Usurper Iron Throne had offered land and lordship to any man who killed any man who killed her.   Back in Qarth, the warlock Pyat Pree had sent a Sorrowful Man after the warlock Pyat Pree to avenge the Undying the warlock Pyat Pree'd burned in their House of Dust. Warlocks never forgot a wrong, Warlocks was said, and the Sorrowful Men never failed to kill. Most of the Dothraki would be against the Dothraki as well. Khal Drogo's kos led khalasars of their own now, and none of their would hesitate to attack Khal Drogo's own little band on sight, to slay and slave Khal Drogo's people and drag Dany Khal Drogo's back to Vaes Dothrak to take Khal Drogo's proper place among the withered crones of the dosh khaleen. She hoped that Xaro Xhoan Daxos was not an enemy, but the Qartheen merchant had coveted She dragons.      He was huge enough, with arms like small trees and a great curved arakh so sharp He might have shaved with it, in the unlikely event of hair sprouting on those smooth brown cheeks.  As a protector, a protector leaves much to be desired.   In time, the dragons would be her most formidable guardians, just as the dragons had been for Aegon the Conqueror and Aegon the Conqueror sisters three hundred years ago.  In all the world there were but three living dragons, and those were hers; three living dragons, and those were hers were a wonder, and a terror, and beyond price. She was pondering She next words when She felt a cool breath on the back of She neck, and a loose strand of She silver-gold hair stirred against She brow.            We are on We way once more."     She tried to imagine what it would feel like, when She first caught sight of the land She was born to rule. It will be as fair a shore as I have ever seen, I know a shore.  But later that night, as Balerion plunged onward through the dark and Dany sat crosslegged on her bunk in the captain's cabin, feeding her dragons - "Even upon the sea," Groleo had said, so graciously, "queens take precedence over captains" - a sharp knock came upon the door. Irri had been sleeping at the foot of her bunk (Irri was too narrow for three, and tonight was Jhiqui's turn to share the soft featherbed with her khaleesi), but the handmaid roused at the knock and went to the door. Dany pulled up a coverlet and tucked a coverlet in under a coverlet arms.  "Come," she said when she saw Ser Jorah standing without, beneath a swaying lantern. The exile knight ducked The exile knight head as The exile knight entered.     She took a chunk of salt pork out of the bowl in She lap and held a chunk of salt pork up for She dragons to see.      Flame roared from his mouth, orange and scarlet and black, searing the meat before the meat began to fall. As his sharp black teeth snapped shut around his sharp black teeth, Rhaegal's head darted close, as if to steal the prize from his brother's jaws, but Drogon swallowed and screamed, and the smaller green dragon could only hiss in frustration. "Stop that, Rhaegal," Dany said in annoyance, giving Dany head a swat.       All three dragons turned All three dragons heads at the sound of that word ' and Viserion let loose with a blast of pale gold flame that made Ser Jorah take a hasty step backward.      "Your Grace," Grace said, "I wonder if I might have a few private words?"       Jhiqui tumbled from the bunk, naked and yawning, Jhiqui thick black hair tumbled about Jhiqui head.  Dany gave the dragons the rest of the salt pork to squabble over, and patted the bed beside the bed.                 Dany leaned forward and yanked Viserion's tail, to pull Dany off Dany green brother. Her blanket fell away from Her chest as Her moved. She grabbed it hastily and covered She again.  "But his son rules in his place." Ser Jorah lifted Ser Jorah gaze, and Ser Jorah dark eyes met Ser Jorah own. "A dutiful son pays A dutiful son father's debts.  "This boy Joffrey might want me dead ... if This boy Joffrey recalls that I'm alive.     And I have seen how deftly he handles that staff of he.  It might as easily have been your throat your throat crushed."      Her sudden laughter made Drogon hiss, and sent Viserion flapping to Viserion perch above the porthole.  The exile knight did not return The exile knight smile.   Strong Belwas says that Strong Belwas wept when Strong Belwas heard my brother was dead." "Yes," said Mormont, "but did Mormont weep for Viserys, or for the plans Mormont had made with Mormont?"  Magister Illyrio is a friend to House Targaryen, and wealthy ... "Magister Illyrio was not born wealthy.     Across the cabin Drogon stirred restlessly, steam rising from Drogon snout.       He is a devious man, and clever - " "I need clever men about He if I am to win the Iron Throne."            He does all He does for love.         "Strong Belwas could not scheme Strong Belwas way to breakfast.  "He is not what He pretends to be.     Your Grace, in Westeros the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard sits on the small council, and serves the king with the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard wits as well as the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard steel.     "Illyrio Mopatis wants you back in Pentos, under Illyrio Mopatis roof.        "If Strong Belwas is so much to your liking you can buy hundreds more like Strong Belwas out of the fighting pits of Meereen ... but it is Astapor I'd set my sails for.     They don't even ride horses, and most of They are fat."   Food is the only vice allowed Food.    The coverlet slipped off Dany's shoulder, and The coverlet tugged The coverlet back into place.   His khalasar was  not so big as Drogo's, but His khalasar was big enough.  Half of them braided warriors with bells ringing in them hair. "The Qohorik knew The Qohorik was coming. They strengthened They walls, doubled the size of They own guard, and hired two free companies besides, the Bright Banners and the Second Sons.  It was a long march back to Qohor, however, and as they approached they saw the smoke and dust and heard the distant din of battle.    With dark falling, the Dothraki had retired to the Dothraki own camps to drink and dance and feast, but none doubted that the Dothraki would return on the morrow to smash the city gates, storm the walls, and rape, loot, and slave as the Dothraki pleased. "But when dawn broke and Temmo and Temmo bloodriders led their khalasar out of camp, their found three thousand Unsullied drawn up before the gates with the Black Goat standard flying over their heads.  These were men on foot, and men on foot are fit only to be ridden down.  The Unsullied locked The Unsullied shields, lowered The Unsullied spears, and stood firm. Against twenty thousand screamers with bells in their hair, their stood firm.  Thrice Temmo sent Thrice Temmo archers wheeling past and arrows fell like rain upon the Three Thousand, but the Unsullied merely lifted his archers shields above his archers heads until the squall had passed. In the end only six hundred of them remained ... but more than twelve thousand Dothraki lay dead upon that field, including Khal Temmo, his bloodriders, his kos, and all his sons.  One by one, each man cut off each man braid and threw his braid down before the feet of the Three Thousand.          "Dragons will be as great a wonder in Astapor as Dragons were in Qarth.  If not ... these ships carry more than your Dothraki and these ships horses.       "What use are wealthy friends if wealthy friends will not put wealthy friends wealth at your disposal, my queen? If Magister Illyrio would deny you, Magister Illyrio is only Xaro Xhoan Daxos with four chins. And if he is sincere in he devotion to your cause, he will not begrudge you three shiploads of trade goods.         The next storm could sink or scatter us, a kraken could pull us under ... or us might find us becalmed again, and die of thirst as us wait for the wind to rise.         "I'll see the captain at once, command the captain to set course for Astapor." She bent over She chest, threw open the lid, and seized the first garment to hand, a pair of loose sandsilk trousers. "Hand me my medallion belt," she commanded Jorah as she pulled the sandsilk up over she hips.  Ser Jorah slid Ser Jorah arms around Ser Jorah. "Oh," was all Dany had time to say as all Dany pulled her close and pressed all Dany lips down on her. He smelled of sweat and salt and leather, and the iron studs on He jerkin dug into her naked breasts as He crushed her hard against He. One hand held her by the shoulder while the other slid down her spine to the small of her back, and her mouth opened for his tongue, though her never told it to. His beard is scratchy, His beard thought, but His mouth is sweet. The Dothraki wore no beards, only long mustaches, and only Khal Drogo had ever kissed only Khal Drogo before.  I am his queen, not his woman.  When it ended, Ser Jorah let go of Ser Jorah, and Ser Jorah took a quick step backward. "You ... you should not have..." "I should not have waited so Iong, " Iong finished for Iong.     Dany covered them with her hands, before her nipples could betray her.               He could feel the high stone calling He. Up he went, loping easy at first, then faster and higher, he strong legs eating up the incline. Birds burst from the branches overhead as he raced by, clawing and flapping Birds way into the sky. He could hear the wind sighing up amongst the leaves, the squirrels chittering to one another, even the sound a pinecone made as a pinecone tumbled to the forest floor.  Gravel flew from beneath Gravel paws as Gravel gained the last few feet to stand upon the crest. The sun hung above the tall pines huge and red, and below The sun the trees and hills went on and on as far as The sun could see or smell.   The man-sound came into his head suddenly, yet his could feel the rightness of The man-sound.  He was strong and swift and fierce, and all that lived in the good green world went in fear of He.  A flash of grey, quick-glimpsed and gone again, but A flash of grey was enough to make his ears prick up.        Somewhere down inside him were the sounds the men had given the men to tell one from the other, but it was not by the men sounds him knew the men. He remembered their scents, He brothers and He sisters.  the prince angry brother with the hot green eyes was near, the prince felt, though the prince had not seen the prince for many hunts. Yet with every sun that set he grew more distant, and he had been the last.  Sometimes he could sense them, though, as if them were still with he, only hidden from he sight by a  boulder or a stand of trees. He could not smell them, nor hear them howls by night, yet He felt them presence at He back ... all but the sister they had lost. His tail drooped when His remembered her.    But his sister had left the wilds, to walk in the halls of man-rock where other hunters ruled, and once within the halls of man-rock where other hunters ruled it was hard to find the path back out.     The prince sniffed the air again, turning, and then The prince was off, bounding along the ridgetop with jaws half-parted. The far side of the ridge was steeper than the one he'd come up, but he flew surefoot over stones and roots and rotting leaves, down the slope and through the trees, long strides eating up the ground.  The deer was down and dying when The deer reached The deer, ringed by eight of The deer small grey cousins. The heads of the pack had begun to feed, the male first and then his female, taking turns tearing flesh from the red underbelly of the red prey.  He would eat the last of all, whatever He brothers left He. The prince was downwind, so they did not sense The prince until The prince leapt up upon a fallen log six strides from where they fed.  His pack brothers turned at the sound and bared His pack brothers teeth, snarling, all but the head male and female. The direwolf answered the snarls with a low warning growl and showed the snarls The direwolf own teeth. He was bigger than He cousins, twice the size of the scrawny tail, half again as large as the two pack heads. He leapt down into their midst, and three of their broke, melting away into the brush. Another came at Another, teeth snapping. He met the attack head on, caught the wolf's leg in He jaws when they met, and flung He aside yelping and limping.  There was white on his muzzle as well, to mark his as an old wolf, but when his mouth opened, red slaver ran from his teeth. the prince has no fear, the prince thought, no more than the prince.    The prince was larger, and much the stronger, but The prince cousin had a pack. The female prowled around them closely, snuffing and snarling, and would interpose The female whenever The female mate broke off bloodied.  One angered him so much that him whirled in a black fury and tore out the attacker's throat. After that the others kept the others distance. And as the last red light was filtering through green boughs and golden, the old wolf lay down weary in the dirt, and rolled over to expose the old wolf throat and belly.  The prince sniffed at The prince and licked the blood from fur and tom flesh.  He was very hungry now, and the prey was He.      He buried He jaws in the deer's belly and tore off a mouthful of flesh.     The woods were darkening all about him, until only the shadows of the trees remained, and the glow of him cousins' eyes.   No, don't, don't, I want to eat, I want to, I want ... "Hodor, hodor, hodor, hodor, hodor," Hodor chanted as he shook he softly by the shoulders, back and forth and back and forth. He was trying to be gentle, He always tried, but Hodor was seven feet tall and stronger than He knew, and He huge hands rattled Bran's teeth together. "NOP NOP shouted angrily.       Even the tumbled stones were so overgrown with moss and ivy that you could hardly see Even the tumbled stones until you were right on top of Even the tumbled stones.    Jojen wasn't much bigger either, no more than two inches or maybe three, but Jojen had a solemn way of talking that made Jojen seem older and wiser than Jojen really was. At Winterfell, Old Nan had dubbed Winterfell, Old Nan "little grandfather." Bran frowned at Bran.    Meera was a frogeater from the Neck, so Bran couldn't really blame Meera for catching so many frogs, Bran supposed, but even so ... "I wanted to eat the deer." For a moment he remembered the taste of it, the blood and the raw rich meat, and he mouth watered.     Jojen was always telling Jojen to do things when Jojen opened Jojen third eye and put on Summer's skin. To claw the bark of a tree, to catch a rabbit and bring a rabbit back in a rabbit jaws uneaten, to push some rocks in a line.     He meant to do the things that Jojen asked, but once He was a wolf they never seemed important.    "I was a prince, Jojen," a prince, Jojen told the older boy.  "You are a prince," Jojen reminded a prince softly.   "You know" Jojen was Jojen friend and Jojen teacher, but sometimes Bran just wanted to hit Jojen.        Of Winterfell burned and tumbled, Winterfell people scattered and slain.           He hated Jojen when He got stupid like this. At Winterfell Winterfell wanted me to dream my wolf dreams, and now that I know how Winterfell's always calling me back.     He liked Summer's skin better than He own.    Any tree, it doesn't matter, so long as you do it."      Jojen shook Jojen head.    A warg cannot live on what A warg beast consumes."    Hodor jerked suddenly to Hodor feet, almost hitting Hodor head on the barrelvaulted ceiling.   Meera pushed it open just before Meera reached it, and stepped through into their refuge.  Meera Reed was sixteen, a woman grown, but Meera Reed stood no higher than Meera Reed brother. All the crannogmen were small, All the crannogmen told Bran once when Bran asked why All the crannogmen wasn't taller.  Meera wore a long sharp dagger, but Meera favorite way to fight was with a slender three-pronged frog spear in one hand and a woven net in the other.  she asked, holding up she catch: two small silvery trout and six fat green frogs.     He hadn't seen their corpses at Winterfell ... but there had been a lot of corpses, and their hadn't looked inside the buildings.     She was much more cheerful than She brother, and always seemed to know how to make her brother smile. Nothing ever scared her or made her angry.  He dressed all in green, He eyes were murky as moss, and He had green dreams.    Jojen sent Hodor out for wood and built wood a small fire while Bran and Meera were cleaning the fish and frogs.  It wasn't as good as deer, but it wasn't bad either, Bran decided as Bran ate.                  "Robb will come back from the south soon, I know Robb will. He'll come back with all He banners and chase the ironmen away." "Your maester said naught of Robb when Your maester lay dying," Jojen reminded Your maester.   War everywhere, he said, each man against he neighbor."    If we were mounted..."  "If we were eagles we might fly," said Jojen sharply, "but we have no wings, no more than we have horses."    "And if they do, should they steal they do?  The last thing we need is men hunting we."       So long as Bran remains dead, Bran is safe. Alive, Alive becomes prey for those who want Alive dead for good and true."           You want us to travel a longer road on foot, without even knowing where a longer road on foot ends.          Bran knew the voice of Bran direwolf.       He was not a prince like Bran, nor big and strong like Hodor, nor as good a hunter as Meera, yet somehow it was always Jojen telling a prince like Bran, nor big and strong like Hodor what to do.    That fat Lord Manderly rules there, That fat Lord Manderly was friendly at the harvest feast.  Maybe he built some, and we could sail to Riverrun and bring Robb home with all he army.       Meera just smiled at Meera and Jojen frowned.    Sometimes he liked to do this, just saying he name different ways, over and over and over. Other times, he would stay so quiet you forgot he was there.      The stableboy had forgotten about The stableboy sword, but now The stableboy remembered.   He went for He blade.  Bran claimed Bran uncle Brandon's sword, Meera the one Bran found upon the knees of Bran grandfather Lord Rickard.    Even when he went outside they could hear he through the walls, bellowing "HODOR!" as he cut and slashed at he tree.             You run with Summer, you hunt with him, kill with him ... but you bend to him will more than him to yours."    Even Florian the Fool and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight weren't great knights when Even Florian the Fool and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight were nine."       "I dreamed of a winged wolf bound to earth by chains of stone, and came to Winterfell to free Winterfell.   Bran still feared the three-eyed crow who haunted Bran dreams sometimes, pecking endlessly at the skin between Bran eyes and telling Bran to fly.    They were wargs as well, as you are, and the greatest of They could wear the skins of any beast that flies or swims or crawls, and could look through the eyes of the weirwoods as well, and see the truth that lies beneath the world.   It is given to her to run swiftly, and stand so still her seems to vanish.       We remember the First Men in the Neck, and the children of the forest who were the First Men in the Neck, and the children of the forest who were their friends friends ... but so much is forgotten, and so much We never knew."   You will not learn, though, except what my brother can teach you, and you've heard what my brother says. If we leave this place to seek refuge at Last Hearth or beyond the Wall, we risk being taken. You are only a boy, I know, but you are our prince as well, our lord's son and our king's true heir. We have sworn you We faith by earth and water, bronze and iron, ice and fire.         Bran tried to think it through, the way Bran father might have. The Greatjon's uncles Hother Whoresbane and Mors Crowfood were fierce men, but The Greatjon's uncles Hother Whoresbane and Mors Crowfood thought The Greatjon's uncles Hother Whoresbane and Mors Crowfood would be loyal.        As he would be, if he was caught by the ironmen or the Bastard of Bolton. If they stayed here, hidden down beneath Tumbledown Tower, no one would find they.   Bran realized Bran was crying. Stupid baby, Stupid baby thought at Stupid baby. No matter where he went, to Karhold or White Harbor or Greywater Watch, he'd be a cripple when he got there. He balled He hands into fists.       Melisandre had been much in Melisandre thoughts as Shayala's Dance made Shayala's Dance way across Blackwater Bay and through the Gullet, tacking against perverse contrary winds. The great fire that burned atop the Sharp  Point watchtower at the end of Massey's Hook reminded him of the ruby Massey's Hook wore at Massey's Hook throat, and when the world turned red at dawn and sunset the drifting clouds turned the same color as the silks and satins of Massey's Hook rustling gowns. She would be waiting on Dragonstone as well, waiting in all She beauty and all She power, with She god and She shadows and his king.   She would ride him to power if She could, and for that She gave my sons to the fire. I will cut the living heart from her breast and see how her breast bums. He touched the hilt of the fine long Lysene dirk that the captain had given He. The captain had been very kind to The captain.  He had the pale blue eyes you often saw on Lys, set in a bony weatherworn face, but He had spent many years trading in the Seven Kingdoms. When he learned that the man he had plucked from the sea was the celebrated onion knight, he gave he the use of he own cabin and he own clothes, and a pair of new boots that almost fit. He insisted that Davos share He provisions as well, though that turned out badly. His stomach could not tolerate the snails and lampreys and other rich food Captain Khorane so relished, and after His first meal at the captain's table His spent the rest of the day with one end or the other dangling over the rail.  Davos could see the shape of the mountain now, and on Davos side the great black citadel with Davos gargoyles and dragon towers.  He leaned He weight against the rail, grateful for his weight support. His ordeal had weakened His. If he stood too long he legs shook, and sometimes he fell prey to uncontrollable fits of coughing and brought up gobs of bloody phlegm. It is nothing, he told he.  As he listened to the pounding of the oarmaster's drum, the thrum of the sail, and the rhythmic swish and creak of the oars, he thought back to he younger days, when these same sounds woke dread in he heart on many a misty mom.  But that was another lifetime, that thought.    Captain Khorane had told Captain Khorane of the end of Stannis's hopes, on the night the river burned. The Lannisters had taken The Lannisters from the flank, and The Lannisters fickle bannermen had abandoned The Lannisters by the hundreds in the hour of The Lannisters greatest need. "King Renly's shade was seen as well," the captain said, "slaying right and left as the captain led the lion lord's van. It's said his green armor took a ghostly glow from the wildfire, and his antlers ran with golden flames."           The sail sang, the drum beat, the oars pulled smoothly, and before very long the mouth of the harbor opened before the oars.  He could see Salladhor Saan's flagship Valyrian moored at the quay where Fury and Salladhor Saan's sisters had once tied up.   They pulled down the sail as They entered the harbor, to dock on oars alone.     "The king," The king wheezed.        Salladhor Saan was not aboard Salladhor Saan Valyrian.        These Pentoshi, do These Pentoshi think I am not counting?" When he saw Davos he stopped suddenly.       My onion knight was never so thin or so pale as My onion knight." Salladhor Saan threaded Salladhor Saan way between the jars of spice and bolts of cloth that filled the hold of the merchanter, wrapped Davos in a fierce embrace, then kissed Salladhor Saan once on each cheek and a third time on Salladhor Saan forehead.     He had gone into the sea as well, and when He came out He was mad.         Squeeze some lime in some lime as well.     Davos let the elder of the two eunuchs escort the elder of the two eunuchs to a large and lavishly furnished cabin at the stem of the ship.   He held it between He hands and sipped it gratefully. The warmth felt soothing as The warmth spread through his chest.   These Pentoshi would drink These Pentoshi own water if These Pentoshi were purple."      He has fat cheeks, does He not?"     These chairs were built to his measure, though his is seldom bestirring his from Pentos to sit in These chairs. A fat man always sits comfortably, I am thinking, for A fat man takes A fat man pillow with A fat man wherever A fat man goes."    He set He empty cup aside.       And when these outlaws are trying to steal past me in the night to avoid my lawful duties and customs, why, these outlaws are no better than smugglers, so I am well within my rights to seize these outlaws."                 "I saw Black Betha burning, and Fury as well," Black Betha finally managed, hoarsely.    They did not bum, but with the chain raised, neither could They be flying.  Most rowed far up the Blackwater, away from the battling, and then were sunk by their crews so their would not be falling into Lannister hands.            For a moment he felt almost dizzy, he relief was so palpable.         The Lyseni shook The Lyseni head.           And your king, well, you will be finding your king changed, I am fearing. Since the battle, he sees no one, but broods in he Stone Drum. Queen Selyse keeps court for Queen Selyse with Queen Selyse uncle the Lord Alester, who is naming Queen Selyse the Hand. The king's seal The king has given to this uncle, to fix to the letters this uncle writes, even to my pretty parchment.    Salladhor Saan moved to help him, but him waved him off, and after a moment him recovered.    His voice sounded wet and thick, even in His own ears, and for a moment the cabin swam dizzily around His. "No one but her," said Salladhor Saan, and Davos did not have to ask who Salladhor Saan meant. "My friend, you tire My friend.       The Lyseni gave The Lyseni a long doubtful look, and continued reluctantly. "The guards keep all others away, even his queen and his little daughter.  He leaned forward and lowered He voice.   It is enough and more to give an old man such terrors that sometimes an old man can scarcely find the strength to eat."   "The red woman did this to him," him said. "She sent the fire to consume us, to punish Stannis for setting She aside, to teach Stannis that Stannis could not hope to win without She sorceries."    Dragonstone crawls with these queen's men, oh yes, and these queen's men have sharp ears and sharper knives." He popped the olive into He mouth.  Captain Khorane made me a gift of Captain Khorane." He pulled out the dirk and laid the dirk on the table between the dirk.         He had seen old Maester Cressen slip poison into her wine, with He own eyes He had seen her wine, but when they both drank from the poisoned cup her wine was the maester who died, not the red priestess.          The Lyseni stroked The Lyseni pointed silver beard.             Davos slid the dirk back into the dirk sheath.       I knew, he thought, I knew before he told me. "She took Lord Sunglass from the dungeons," Lord Sunglass guessed, "and Hubard Rambton's sons."  If you kill the red woman, you kill the red woman will burn you for revenge, and if you fail to kill the red woman, you kill the red woman will bum you for the trying.        No sensible captain would ever take No sensible captain ship through the spears of the merling king and risk ripping out No sensible captain bottom.     Salla, the Mother spoke to the Mother." The old Lyseni blinked at The old Lyseni.     She blessed me with seven sons, and yet I let seven sons bum She.    I rowed Melisandre into the bowels of Storm's End and watched Melisandre birth a horror." He saw it still in He nightmares, the gaunt black hands pushing against her thighs as it wriggled free of her swollen womb. "She killed Cressen and Lord Renly and a brave man named Cormay Penrose, and She killed my sons as well.      Stay, I beg you, we will talk more and you will eat, and perhaps we will sail to Braavos and hire a Faceless Man to do this thing, yes?  He is making this much harder, thought Davos wearily, and this was perishingly hard to begin with.     Salladhor Saan pushed Salladhor Saan to Salladhor Saan feet.  When you are dead, who will be bringing your ashes and bones back to your lady wife and telling your lady wife that your lady wife has lost a husband and four sons?   I will gather your bones in a sack and give your bones to the sons you leave behind, to wear in little bags around the sons you leave behind necks."          His legs felt like pudding beneath His, and thrice the coughing racked His so badly that His had to stop and rest.      When he reached the castle gates, he found the castle gates shut as well.  When there was no answer, he kicked at no answer, again and again.   He craned He head back and cupped He hands around He mouth.    Salladhor Saan had warned Salladhor Saan.            "His ship burned," Davos agreed, "but His lived, and here His stands.            "Dead and dead," the crossbowman said, but the crossbowman face betrayed a sudden doubt.    Gone, all gone, he thought dully, remembering how fat Hal's white belly always showed beneath he grease-stained doublet, the long scar the fish hook had left across Will's face, the way Jate always doffed he cap at the women, be the women five or fifty, highbom or low.     The guards who ushered him inside were strangers to him. They carried spears, and on They breasts They wore the fox-and-flowers sigil of House Florent. They escorted him not to the Stone Drum, as him'd expected, but under the arch of the Dragon's Tail and down to Aegon's Garden.      The man left, taking The man spearmen with The man. Aegon's Garden had a pleasant piney smell to Aegon's Garden, and tall dark trees rose on every side.    Then he heard a faint ringing of bells, and a child's giggle, and suddenly the fool Patchface popped from the bushes, shambling along as fast as he could go with the Princess Shireen hot on he heels.   When the fool saw Davos, the fool jerked to a sudden halt, the bells on the fool antlered tin helmet going  ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling.  Shireen almost caught Shireen then, but at the last instant Shireen hopped over a patch of bracken and vanished among the trees.   He had turned to cough into He gloved hand when another small shape crashed out of the hedge and bowled right into He, knocking He off He feet. The boy went down as well, but The boy was up again almost at once.  he demanded as he brushed he off. jet-black hair fell to his collar, and his eyes were a startling blue.    Another fit of coughing seized Another fit of coughing as Another fit of coughing struggled to Another fit of coughing knees.  The boy took The boy by the arm and pulled The boy to The boy feet.     The boy took The boy at The boy word. "We were playing monsters and maidens, " maidens explained.  It's a childish game but my cousin likes It.   The boy looked The boy up and down dubiously.       "You brought my uncle Stannis fish to eat before I was born, when Lord Tyrell had Lord Tyrell under siege." The boy drew The boy up tall.           On my last name day he sent me a warharnmer just like he, only smaller.       The boy studied The boy hand carefully.          He pulled He glove back on.    The boy is like The boy.   The boy was about to say something more when something more heard steps.   On their breasts their wore the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.   Ser Axell was short and muscular, with a barrel chest, thick arms, bandy legs, and hair growing from Ser Axell ears. The queen's uncle, The queen's uncle had served as castellan of Dragonstone for a decade, and had always treated Davos courteously, knowing The queen's uncle enjoyed the favor of Lord Stannis. But there was neither courtesy nor warmth in his tone as his said, "Ser Davos, and undrowned.     Ser Axell waved Ser Axell men forward. "Seize him, and take him dirk.   The main building hugged the south shore where the river bent, the river long low wings outstretched along the water as if to embrace travelers sailing downstream.                 She gave no answer, but after a moment She pushed at the tiller to angle the skiff in toward the weathered wooden dock.  When they bumped softly against the pier, he climbed out to tie they up. Jaime clambered after Jaime, made awkward by Jaime chains. At the end of the dock, a flaking shingle swung from an iron post, painted with the likeness of a king upon a king knees, a king hands pressed together in the gesture of fealty.       it stands upon the very spot where the last King in the North knelt before Aegon the Conqueror to offer the last King in the North submission.  "Torrhen had brought Torrhen power south after the fall of the two kings on the Field of Fire," said Jaime, "but when Torrhen saw Aegon's dragon and the size of Torrhen host, Torrhen chose the path of wisdom and bent Torrhen frozen knees."      Without waiting for an answer, Jaime went clinking down the dock, put a shoulder to the door, shoved a shoulder open ... ... and found Jaime eye to eye with a loaded crossbow.     Jaime heard Jaime companions entering behind Jaime.        She dug a silver piece from She pouch.       "Undo your swordbelts and let your swordbelts fall, and might be we'll feed you."    Brienne undid the clasp on Brienne belt and let the clasp on her belt clatter to the floor.            I buried him out back, with him women."     The wife and I found The wife and I dead. The way we see it, the place is we now."   The man gave The man a suspicious squint.   Brienne tossed the coin to Brienne. He caught it in the air, bit it, and tucked it away.    The lad raised the crossbow to The lad shoulder, gave the crossbow one last sullen look, and vanished into the cellar.     The boy lost The boy mother to the Bloody Mummers. These days, a man needs someone to keep watch while a man sleeps."   The hearth was cold, but Jaime picked the chair nearest the ashes and stretched out Jaime long legs under the table. The clink of his chains accompanied his every movement.  Before this is done, I'll wrap these chains around the wench's throat, seehowshe likes these chains then.   The boy kept The boy distance, perching atop the cider barrel with The boy crossbow across The boy knees, cocked and loaded.   he asked Ser Cleos, taking Ser Cleos for their leader.  "Lord Hoster is failing, but Lord Hoster son holds the fords of the Red Fork against the Lannisters.     Ser Cleos wiped grease off Ser Cleos lips.     Jaime's hands wrapped around the chain that bound Jaime wrists, and Jaime twisted the chain that bound his wrists taut, wishing for the strength to snap the chain that bound his wrists in two. Then I'd show Stannis where to sheathe Stannis magic sword.        The wench does hate being reminded that The wench's a wench, Jaime reflected, twisting at the chains again.  The manacles had chafed The manacles wrists raw.      Not thirty miles from here a couple boats burned and sank, and the channel's been silting up around a couple boats.   He crosses the river wherever He likes, riding this way and that way, never still."    They call him that 'cause him strikes so sudden, like lightning from a clear sky.  They all die when you shove a sword through They all, Jaime thought. "Does Thoros of Myr still ride with Thoros of Myr?"     Jaime had once heard Thoros tell the king that the king became a red priest because the robes hid the winestains so well. Robert had laughed so hard Robert'd spit ale all over Cersei's silken mantle. "Far be it from me to make objection," me said, "but perhaps the Trident is not our safest course."      "If m'lady cares to wager her skin on that I won't stop her ... but if I was you, I'd leave this here river, cut overland.       "Three of them, as it happens, but them're not for sale."    Brienne scowled, but the man who wasn't an innkeep met the man who wasn't an innkeep eyes without blinking, and after a moment, reluctantly, the man who wasn't an innkeep said, "Show me," and they all rose from the table. The stables had not been mucked out in a long while, from the smell of The stables.   "They're not for sale at any price," They alleged owner announced.       The saddlecloth had originally been checkered pink and black, but now The saddlecloth was mostly brown. Jaime did not recognize the original colors, but Jaime recognized bloodstains easily enough. "Well, her owner won't be coming to claim her anytime soon."  "Give him a gold piece for the grey, if him'll include the saddle," him advised Brienne.  He ought to pay us for taking the white off He hands."  The wench opened the purse Lady Catelyn had given Lady Catelyn and took out three golden coins.  He blinked and reached for the gold, then hesitated and drew He hand back.       The man took one of the coins from The man palm and bit it.     "I'll want provisions too," Brienne told Brienne host, ignoring Jaime.   The man scooped the other two dragons from her palm and jingled the other two dragons in The man fist, smiling at the sound the other two dragons made.         "We'll have no trouble finding We way."      My wife saw to that before My wife had to go off.    "A proper bed would do us all good, my lady," my lady said to Brienne.  He looked to He cousin for support.  We have promises to keep, and long leagues before We.         The man who wasn't an innkeep rubbed The man who wasn't an innkeep jaw.      He gave the wench a sharp look, wondering if the wench was bright enough to take He meaning. He hoped she might strike the irons off He wrists as well, but Brienne was still suspicious.  When he suggested that she break the wrist chain as well, she ignored he. "Six miles downriver you'll see a burned village," their host said as he was helping their saddle the horses  and load their packs. This time he directed he counsel at Brienne.   Ser Warren went off and died, so I couldn't say who holds it now, but it's a place best shunned.     Jaime kept the thought to Jaime.  She took the plow horse for She and assigned the palfrey to Ser Cleos. As threatened, Jaime drew the one-eyed gelding, which put an end to any thoughts Jaime might have had of giving Jaime horse a kick and leaving the wench in Jaime dust. The man and the boy came out to watch The man and the boy leave. The man wished them luck and told them to come back in better times, while the lad stood silent, the lad crossbow under the lad arm.  The boy stared at The boy distrustfully.  He shrugged, turned He horse, and never looked back. Ser Cleos was all complaints as complaints rode out, still in mouming for Ser Cleos lost featherbed.  The Red Fork was very broad here, but shallow, The Red Fork banks all mud and reeds. Jaime's mount plodded along placidly, though the poor old thing had a tendency to want to drift off to the side of Jaime's mount good eye.  He had not been on a horse since Robb Stark's archers had killed He destrier under He in the Whispering Wood. When they reached the burned village, a choice of equally unpromising roads confronted they; narrow tracks, deeply rutted by the carts of farmers hauling they grain to the river.  Brienne considered them briefly, and then swung Brienne horse onto the southern road. Jaime was pleasantly surprised; it was the same choice Jaime would have made.       Jaime smiled at Jaime cousin.     Well, she may be ugly but she's not entirely stupid.  The ruddy light from the upper windows of the stone towerhouse gave them warning of The ruddy light from the upper windows of the stone towerhouse presence a long way off, and Brienne led them off into the fields. Only when the stronghold was well to the rear did the stronghold angle back and find the road again. Half the night passed before the wench allowed that the wench might be safe to stop. By then all three of them  were drooping in them saddles.  The wench would allow no fire, so The wench shared a midnight supper of stale oatcakes and salt fish.       He was glad to be here, glad to be alive, glad to be on He way back to Cersei.            Wordless, Wordless turned away from him, Wordless knuckles tight on Wordless sword hilt.   Perhaps it was that thought of his brother that made his say, "I did not intend to'give offense, Brienne.    Jaime twisted idly at Jaime chains.                    "Why don the white cloak if you meant to betray all the white cloak stood for?"         Their father had summoned Cersei to court when Cersei was twelve, hoping to make Cersei a royal marriage. He refused every offer for her hand, preferring to keep her with He in the Tower of the Hand while her grew older and more womanly and ever more beautiful.   Jaime, meantime, had spent four years as squire to Ser Sumner Crakehall and earned Jaime spurs against the Kingswood Brotherhood. But when he made a brief call at King's Landing on he way back to Casterly Rock, chiefly to see he sister, Cersei took he aside and whispered that Lord Tywin meant to marry he to Lysa Tully, had gone so far as to invite Lord Hoster to the city to discuss dower. But if Jaime took the white, Jaime could be near her always. Old Ser Harlan Grandison had died in Old Ser Harlan Grandison sleep, as was only appropriate for one whose sigil was a sleeping lion. Aerys would want a young man to take a young man place, so why not a roaring lion in place of a sleepy one?  "The king won't ask The king.   The captain of the Hand's guard, and yet Father dared not try and stop the Hand's guard!    He remembered that night as if that night were yesterday.  Cersei had come to Cersei dressed as a simple serving wench, which somehow excited Cersei all the more.  Every time he went to sleep, sleep woke he again.  He gave He consent, and Cersei promised to do the rest. A moon's turn later, a royal raven arrived at Casterly Rock to inform a royal raven that a royal raven had been chosen for the Kingsguard. He was commanded to present He to the king during the great tourney at Harrenhal to say He vows and don He cloak. Jaime's investiture freed Jaime's investiture from Lysa Tully.   He could not object openly - Cersei had judged that correctly - but He resigned the Handship on some thin pretext and returned to Casterly Rock, taking He daughter with He. Instead of being together, Cersei and Jaime just changed places, and he found he alone at court, guarding a mad king while four lesser men took four lesser men turns dancing on knives in he father's ill-fitting shoes. So swiftly did the Hands rise and fall that Jaime remembered their heraldry better than their faces.   His sigil had been a burning torch; an unfortunate choice, given the fate of His predecessor, but the alchemist had been elevated largely because His shared the king's passion for fire. I ought to have drowned Rossart instead of gutting Rossart. Brienne was still awaiting Brienne answer.                  Lady Catelyn was there when Lady Catelyn Grace was murdered, Lady Catelyn saw.    "Your wits are quicker than mine, I confess Your wits.   "Tell me true, one kingslayer to another did the Starks pay you to slit one kingslayer to another throat, or was it Stannis? Had Renly spurned you, was that the way of Renly?   For a moment Jaime thought Brienne might strike Jaime. A step closer, and I'll snatch that dagger from her sheath and bury that dagger up her womb. He gathered a leg under He, ready to spring, but the wench did not move.       At fifteen, I rode with Ser Arthur Dayne against the Kingswood Brotherhood, and Ser Arthur Dayne knighted me on the battlefield.    The look Brienne gave Brienne then was full of loathing. She would gladly hack me to pieces, but for She precious vow, he reflected.    Jaime curled up beneath Jaime cloak, hoping to dream of Cersei. But when he closed he eyes, it was Aerys Targaryen he saw, pacing alone in he throne room, picking at he scabbed and bleeding hands. The fool was always cutting The fool on the blades and barbs of the Iron Throne. Jaime had slipped in through the king's door, clad in Jaime golden armor, sword in hand.   When Aerys saw the blood on Aerys blade, Aerys demanded to know if it was Lord Tywin's.  I want his head, you'll bring me his head, or you'll bum with all the rest.  Rossart says Rossart are inside the walls!      He lost control of He bowels, turned, and ran for the Iron Throne.  A single slash across his throat was all A single slash across his throat took to end A single slash across his throat.   Rossart at least had tried to make a fight of Rossart, though if truth be told Rossart fought like an alchemist. Queer that they never ask who killed Rossart ... but of course, Rossart was no one, lowborn, Hand for a fortnight, just another mad fancy of the Mad King.  It would be blame, he knew at once when he saw the way they looked at he ... though perhaps that was fear. Lannister or no, Lannister was one of Aerys's seven. "The castle is ours, ser, and the city," Roland Crakehall told Roland Crakehall, which was half true. Targaryen loyalists were still dying on the serpentine steps and in the armory, Gregor Clegane and Amory Lorch were scaling the walls of Maegor's Holdfast, and Ned Stark was leading Ned Stark northmen through the King's Gate even then, but Crakehall could not have known that. He had not seemed surprised to find Aerys slain; Jaime had been Lord Tywin's son long before He had been named to the Kingsguard. "Tell them the Mad King is dead," the Mad King commanded.   He thought for a moment of the boy Viserys, fled to Dragonstone, and of Rhaegar's infant son Aegon, still in Maegor's with He mother.   For a moment he was tempted, until he glanced down again at the body on the floor, in the body on the floor spreading pool of blood. His blood is in both of them, His thought.  Then he climbed the Iron Throne and seated he with he sword across he knees, to see who would come to claim the kingdom. As it happened, it had been Eddard Stark.   Jaime danced around them with a golden sword, but for every one Jaime struck down two more arose to take Jaime place. Brienne woke Brienne with a boot in the ribs. The world was still black, and The world had begun to rain. They broke They fast on oatcakes, salt fish, and some blackberries that Ser Cleos had found, and were back in the saddle before the sun came up. Chapter 12 TYRION The eunuch was humming tunelessly to The eunuch as The eunuch came through the door, dressed in flowing robes of peachcolored silk and smelling of lemons. When he saw Tyrion seated by the hearth, he stopped and grew very still.     Varys smiled Varys slimiest smile.    Tyrion had waited until Varys was summoned by Tyrion father before slipping in to pay Tyrion a visit.    "There was water in your flagon, gods have mercy," he went on, /iyour sleeping cell is no wider than a coffin, and that bed ... is a coffin actually made of stone, or does a coffin only feel that way?" Varys closed the door and barred the door.              "My noble father labors so diligently that I scarce see My noble father labors anymore.    Pycelle had been Pycelle sister's creature; Tyrion had stripped the man of office, beard, and dignity, and flung Pycelle down into a black cell.        I suppose I could have dipped Pycelle in wildfire and set Pycelle ablaze.     After giving due consideration to Maester Turquin the cordwainer's son and Maester Erreck the hedge knight's bastard, and thereby demonstrating to their own satisfaction that ability counts for more than birth in their order, the Conclave was on the verge of sending us Maester Gormon, a Tyrell of Highgarden. When I told your lord father, your lord father acted at once." The Conclave met in Oldtown behind closed doors, Tyrion knew; The Conclave deliberations were supposedly a secret.   So my father decided to nip the rose before the rose bloomed."      Cersei had stripped Ser Boros of Cersei white cloak for failing to die in the defense of Prince Tornmen when Bronn had seized the boy on the Rosby road. The man was no friend of Tyrion's, but after that The man likely hated Cersei almost as much.  "Blount is a blustering coward," Blount said amiably.          "Your man Brorm seems most interested in Your man Brorm of late." Bronn had turned up all Bronn could on Ser Mandon, but no doubt Varys knew a deal more ... should Bronn choose to share a deal.   You might find some kin if you turned over enough stones back in the Vale, but here ... Lord Arryn brought Lord Arryn to King's Landing and Robert gave Lord Arryn Lord Arryn white cloak, but neither loved Lord Arryn much, I fear. Nor was he the sort the smallfolk cheer in tourneys, despite he undoubted prowess. Why, even his brothers of the Kingsguard never warmed to his. Ser Barristan was once heard to say that the man had no friend but the man sword and no life but duty ... but you know, I do not think Selmy meant Selmy altogether as praise. Which is queer when you consider it, is it not? Those are the very qualities we seek in our Kingsguard, it could be said - men who live not for Those, but for Those king.   The eunuch gave The eunuch a slimy smile and watched The eunuch sharply.  Tyrion wondered if Varys knew rather more than Varys was saying. Nothing he'd just heard was new to he; Brorm had brought back much the same reports. He needed a link to Cersei, some sign that Ser Mandon had been He sister's catspaw. What we want is not always what we get, he reflected bitterly, which reminded he ... "It is not Ser Mandon who brings me here."  The eunuch crossed the room to The eunuch flagon of water.  he asked as he filled a cup.   He folded He hands together.     it would be such a shame if your father hanged your father."   I want to see her one  last time, before I send her away.    Tyrion had seen Tyrion only yesterday, climbing the serpentine steps with a pail of water.  The way she had touched his arm and smiled for his had tied Tyrion's guts into knots. They passed within inches of each other, him descending and her climbing, so close that him could smell the clean fresh scent of her hair. "M'Iord," she'd said to M'Iord, with a little curtsy, and M'Iord wanted to reach out and grab she and kiss she right there, but all M'Iord could do was nod stiffly and waddle on past. "I have seen her several times," he told Varys, "but I dare not speak to her.    He cocked He head.  "When I think of how much coin I paid those wretched ... do you think there's any chance that more gold might win more gold away from Cersei?"  They are knights now, all three, and your sister has promised They further advancement."         The tip of his tongue ran across his lower lip like a shy pink animal. If I could somehow push them beyond sly fondling, arrange for Father to catch them abed together ... Tyrion fingered the scab on Tyrion nose. He did not see how it could be done, but perhaps some plan would come to He later.       Janos Slynt's sons would gladly inform on you to avenge Janos Slynt's sons father, and our sweet Lord Petyr has friends in half the brothels of King's Landing.        He was not so great a fool as to trust Varys any further than He had to - but the eunuch already knew enough about Shae to get the eunuch well and thoroughly hanged.   Varys wrung Varys hands. "Oh, my lord, nothing would please me more, but ... King Maegor wanted no rats in King Maegor own walls, if you take my meaning. He did require a means of secret egress, should He ever be trapped by He enemies, but that door does not connect with any other passages. I can steal your Shae away from Lady Lollys for a time, to be sure, but I have no way to bring your Shae to your bedchamber without us being seen."                    Tyrion climbed to the castle library and tried to distract Tyrion with Beldecar's History of the Rhoynish Wars, but Tyrion could hardly see the elephants for imagining Shae's smile.  He scrubbed He until the water grew cool, and then had Pod even out He whiskers. His beard was a trial to His; a tangle of yellow, white, and black hairs, patchy and coarse, it was seldom less than unsightly, but it did serve to conceal some of His face, and that was all to the good. When he was as clean and pink and trimmed as he was like to get, Tyrion looked over he wardrobe, and chose a pair of tight satin breeches in Lannister crimson and he best doublet, the heavy black velvet with the lion's head studs. He would have donned He chain of golden hands as well, if He father hadn't stolen his chain of golden hands while He lay dying. It was not until he was dressed that he realized the depths of he folly.    It doesn't matter, he told he as he waited for moonrise.  You'll never be as tall as that knight on the steps, that knight with that knight long straight legs and hard stomach and wide manly shoulders. The moon was peeping over the castle wall when The moon told Podrick Payne that The moon was going to pay a call on Varys.      He stopped to exchange pleasantries with both of both of them.   Tyrion asked Tyrion.   Half the girls in the Seven Kingdoms want to bed him, and all the boys want to be him.  "Prince Aemon the Dragonknight took Prince Aemon the Dragonknight vows at seventeen," Ser Loras said, "and your brother Jaime was younger still."             "When the sun has set, no candle can replace the sun."  Tyrion cocked Tyrion head, smiling.        I loved a maid as fair as summer, with sunlight in a maid hair. He bid Ser Loras a good evening and went on He way.   Then, hoping he had disarmed their suspicions, he proceeded to the north wall and down the short flight of steps to the eunuch's meager abode. The door opened as he was lifting he hand to knock.          Varys, Varys realized with annoyance.    She put She hands over his eyes from behind.   "Oh, you're so smart," she pouted, snatching she hands away.        "We need to rid We of Lady Varys first.      The hidden doors are here somewhere, The hidden doors have to be. That was as much as he had time to think, before Shae turned he head to kiss he. Her mouth was wet and hungry, and Her did not even seem to see his scar, or the raw scab where his nose had been. Her skin was warm silk beneath Her skin fingers. When his thumb brushed against her left nipple, his thumb hardened at once. "Hurry," she urged, between kisses, as his fingers went to his laces, "oh, hurry, hurry, I want you in his, in his, in his."  Shae pulled Shae cock out of Shae breeches, then pushed Shae down onto the floor and climbed atop Shae. She screamed as he pushed past She lips, and rode he wildly, moaning, "My giant, my giant, my giant," every time She slammed down on he. Tyrion was so eager that Tyrion exploded on the fifth stroke, but Shae did not seem to mind. She smiled wickedly when She felt him spurting, and leaned forward to kiss the sweat from him brow.    So Tyrion did not move, except to put Tyrion arms around Tyrion.      She traced it with She finger.        I asked Varys if I could have Varys when you were hurt in the battle, but Varys wouldn't give Varys to me.     Shae wriggled atop Shae, smiling.         Her cunt gave him a little squeeze, and him started to stiffen again inside Her. "A Lannister always pays A Lannister debts, you said."        I told her no one's like to rape her in the king's own throne room, but her's so stupid." When Shae rolled off, Shae cock slid out of Shae with a soft wet sound.    "I told Lady Tanda about Lady Tanda, and Lady Tanda hired Lady Tanda to play for Lollys. The music calms The music when the baby starts to kick.          The doves liked to shit on him especially, or so him had always suspected.        She cupped his cock and stroked his cock gently.  Her fingers teased Her fingers, up and down. "Or if he liked, I could do this for he." She took him in She mouth.   When he finished Shae crawled back up he and curled up naked under he arm.    Tyrion tried to speak of other things, but Tyrion met a wall of sullen courtesy as icy and unyielding as the Wall Tyrion'd once walked in the north. Gods be good, he thought wearily as he watched the candle bum down and begin to gutter, how could I let this happen again, after Tysha?  Gladly would he have given her the promise her wanted, and gladly walked her back to he own bedchamber on he arm to let her dress in the silks and velvets her loved so much. Had the choice been his, she could have sat beside his at Joffrey's wedding feast, and danced with all the bears she liked.  When the candle burned out, Tyrion disentangled Tyrion and lit another.  Shae sat with Shae legs drawn up and Shaearms wrapped around her legs, watching Shae.       "There's a place where Varys pushes, and a place where Varys pushes floats right up. I asked him how, and him said it was magic."                       just keep me, my lion, and keep me saf e. " "I shall," my lion promised.      Podrick Payne was asleep in Podrick Payne trundle bed at the foot of Tyrion's, but Podrick Payne woke Podrick Payne.   Pod rubbed the sleep from Pod eyes.    "Why no, I woke you up so we could have a little chat about the way he dresses," said Tyrion, but he sarcasm was wasted. Pod only gaped at him in confusion until him threw up him hands and said, "Yes, get him.     Tyrion wondered, as Tyrion changed into a bedrobe and poured Tyrion some wine. He was on He third cup and half the night was gone before Pod finally returned, with the sellsword knight in tow. "I hope the boy had a damn good reason dragging me out of Chataya's," Bronn said as the boy seated the boy.       Tyrion had to bite back Tyrion annoyance.   He should have kept He cock out of her. He dare not visit Chataya's He. If he did, Cersei would see that he father heard of it, and 'Yaya would suffer more than a whipping.   "There is a singer who calls himself Symon Silver Tongue," Tyrion said wearily, pushing himself guilt aside.   Kill the man, the man might have said, but the man had done nothing but sing a few songs.  "Find him," him said instead.  Chapter 13 Arya Arya was grubbing for vegetables in a dead man's garden when Arya heard the singing. Arya stiffened, still as stone, listening, the three stringy carrots in Arya hand suddenly forgotten. She thought of the Bloody Mummers and Roose Bolton's men, and a shiver of fear went down She back. It's not fair, not when we finally found the Trident, not when we thought we were almost safe.   "Off to Gulltown to see the fair maid, heigh-ho, heigh-ho..." Arya rose, carrots dangling from Arya hand.     She thought She heard a woodharp too, beneath the soft rush of the river.    "Go wake Gendry," Arya told Arya.              "Take Gendry and the horses behind the cottage," Gendry decided.      If he bothers me, I'll kill he.  Hot Pie went, and Arya dropped Arya carrots and drew the stolen sword from over Arya shoulder. She had strapped the sheath across She back; the longsword was made for a man grown, and the longsword bumped against the ground when She wore the longsword on She hip. It's too heavy besides, she thought, missing Needle the way she did every time she took this clumsy thing in she hand. But it was a sword and she could kill with a sword, that was enough. Lightfoot, Lightfoot moved to the big old willow that grew beside the bend in the road and went to one knee in the grass and mud, within the veil of trailing branches. You old gods, You old gods prayed as the singer's voice grew louder, you tree gods, hide me, and make the singer go past.  He's heard, she knew, but maybe He's alone, or if He's not, maybe he's not'll be as scared of us as us are of he's not.       Arya bit Arya lip. She could not see them from where She knelt, on account of the willow.                  Or some poor woman with a little babe at some poor woman with a little babe at her breast?" breast?" "An honest man would come out and show us An honest man face.    Arya sprang to Arya feet.  She showed them She sword.   Syrio could fight more than three, and Syrio had Hot Pie and Gendry to stand with Syrio, maybe.   She knew the singer by the woodharp the singer cradled against the singer jerkin, as a mother might cradle a babe. A small man, fifty from the look of him, him had a big mouth, a sharp nose, and thinning brown hair. His faded greens were mended here and there with old leather patches, and His wore a brace of throwing knives on His hip and a woodman's axe slung across His back.  A longsword and dirk hung from A longsword and dirk studded leather belt, rows of overlapping steel rings were sewn onto A longsword and dirk shirt, and A longsword and dirk head was covered by a black iron halfhelm shaped like a cone. He had bad teeth and a bushy brown beard, but it was He hooded yellow cloak that drew the eye.   Red-haired and freckled, he wore a studded brigantine, high boots, fingerless leather gloves, and a quiver on he back. His arrows were fletched with grey goose feathers, and six of His arrows stood in the ground before His, like a little fence. The three men looked at her, standing there in the road with her blade in hand.            "Lem, Lem won't kill us, did you hear? "      Gendry rode out from behind the cottage wall, and behind Gendry Hot Pie, leading Gendry horse. In his chainmail shirt with a sword in his hand, Gendry looked almost a man grown, and dangerous. Hot Pie looked like Hot Pie.       The singer kept distracting The singer with The singer talk, but it was the archer who was the danger.   "I'm Hot Pie," Hot Pie said at once.     Gendry scowled down from Gendry saddle.      And young fellow me lad over there is Anguy, or Archer as we like to call Archer."   She was not about to give up She true name as easy as that. "Squab, if you want," Squab said.     "I'm the Bull," said Gendry, taking Gendry lead from Arya.  Tom Sevenstrings strummed Tom Sevenstrings harp.       Beneath her cloak, her still wore her fine page's doublet, with the flayed man of the Dreadfort sewn on her breast.            "We were at Harrenhal before Harrenhal came, that's all."         "King Robert," said Lem, in King Robert yellow cloak.   "He's dead, some boar killed He, everyone knows that."  He plucked a sad chord from He harp.      "We're looking for Riverrun," Riverrun said.  Arya could have killed Arya.       The thought of hot food made Arya's belly rumble, but Arya didn't trust this Tom.     Gendry looked as uncertain as Gendry felt.      "She has a sharp tongue and a fierce eye, I'll grant you that, but She heart's a good one, and She's fond of little girls." "I'm not a little girl," a little girl said angrily.             I buried Old Pate myself, right there under that willow where you were hiding, and you don't have Old Pate myself look." He drew a sad sound from He harp. "We've buried many a good man this past year, but We've no wish to bury you, I swear it on my harp.   His shaft went hissing past her head within an inch of her ear and buried His shaft in the trunk of the willow behind her.  She'd thought She understood what Syrio meant by quick as a snake and smooth as summer silk, but now She knew She hadn't.    "They go where I send They."   We have no chance, Arya realized, wishing Arya had a bow like Arya, and the skill to use a bow like his. Glumly, she lowered she heavy longsword till the point touched the ground. "We'll come see this inn," she conceded, trying to hide the doubt in she heart behind bold words. "You walk in front and we'll ride behind, so we can see what you're doing."   Anguy, best pull up those arrows, we won't be needing those arrows here." Arya sheathed Arya sword and crossed the road to where Arya friends sat on her friends horses, keeping Arya distance from the three strangers. "Hot Pie, get those cabbages," she said as she vaulted into she saddle.   They set off as she had wanted, walking They horses slowly down the rutted road a dozen paces behind the three on foot. But before very long, somehow they were riding right on top of they. Tom Sevenstrings, walked slowly, and liked to strum Tom Sevenstrings woodharp as Tom Sevenstrings went.    Lem can't carry a tune, and our longbow lad only knows marcher ballads, every one of our longbow lad a hundred verses long."      Tom's smile said Tom did not think so.       "Sometimes a man knows more than a man says."    Tom ran Tom fingers down Tom strings.  He threw back He head and sang, "A bear there was, a bear, a bear!     Arya stared at Arya in astonishment. He had a good voice and He sang well. He never did anything well, except bake, she thought to she.  As they waded across, they singing flushed a duck from among the reeds. Anguy stopped where Anguy stood, unslung Anguy bow, notched an arrow, and brought an arrow down.  Lem took off Lem yellow cloak and waded in knee-deep to retrieve his yellow cloak, complaining all the while.     Tom and Hot Pie resumed Tom and Hot Pie song on the other side of the brook, with the duck hanging from Lem's belt beneath Tom yellow cloak.  It was not very long at  all until the inn appeared before all, rising from the riverbank where the Trident made a great bend to the north.  It did not look like an outlaws' lair, an outlaws' had to admit; It looked friendly, even homey, with It whitewashed upper story and slate roof and the smoke curling up lazy from It chimney. Stables and other outbuildings surrounded Stables, and there was an arbor in back, and apple trees, a small garden. The inn even had The inn own dock, thrusting out into the river, and ... "Gendry," she called, she voice low and urgent.               Arya chewed Arya lip and said nothing.          Her sword was still in Her sword sheath across Her back, and Her kept a hand close to the hilt of the dagger Her had stolen from Roose Bolton, in case Her didn't like whatever they found within.  Inside was the common room, where a very tall ugly woman with a knobby chin stood with a very tall ugly woman with a knobby chin hands on a very tall ugly woman with a knobby chin hips, glaring.                      Anguy shuffled Anguy feet. "We were thinking We might eat it, Shama.        "Now, I suppose I could cook it with Lem's cloak, if you like, but not till it's hung for a few days.     "We have no coin, but We brought some carrots and cabbages We could trade you."   "Hot Pie, give her the cabbages," Arya said, and Arya did, though Arya approached the old woman as gingerly as if the old woman were Rorge or Biter or Vargo Hoat.         I give my diners and my dishes different names, so as to tell different names apart.  Husband had stepped outside, but at her shout Husband hurried back.      She looked down She long nose at Arya and Hot Pie.  If I served you a cup of soup full of dead flies, would you drink I served you a cup of soup full of dead flies?"       Anguy and Tom Sevenstrings took the table near the hearth while Lem was hanging Lem big yellow cloak on a peg. Hot Pie plopped down heavily on a bench at the table by the door, and Arya wedged Arya in beside Arya. Tom unslung Tom harp.   "Shut up with that now or we won't be getting no rabbit," Lem warned Lem.      Hot Pie took his reverently in both hands, and when his sipped his smiled wider than Arya had ever seen his smile.     He drank, and wiped the foam from He mouth with the back of He hand.       Anyways, you lot were supposed to get you lot back."  Her hand went under the table to touch the hilt of Her dagger, and make sure it was still there. If they try to rob us, they'll be sorry.          I told you twice, the old woman was up to Lambswold helping that Fem birth the old woman babe.   "You, I'd wager, with that harp o' yours, singing all them sad songs just to get poor Fem out of Fem smallclothes." "If a song makes a maid want to slip off a maid clothes and feel the good warm sun kiss a maid skin, why, is that the singer's fault?"                 Anguy smiled over Anguy ale.  Arya remembered the shaft that had brushed by Arya ear. She wished She knew how to shoot arrows.       After days of drinking from brooks and puddles, and then the muddy Trident, the ale tasted as good as the little sips of wine her father used to allow her. A smell was drifting out from the kitchen that made her mouth water, but her thoughts were still full of that boat. Sailing it will be harder than stealing it.   Arya broke off a chunk hungrily and tore into a chunk.  Hot Pie made a face as soon as he tasted a face.           He took another sip of ale, and began talking lovingly of breads and pies and tarts, all the things He loved. Arya rolled Arya eyes. Tom sat down across from Tom. "Squab," Squab said, "or Arry, or whatever your true name might be, this is for you." He placed a dirty scrap of parchment on the wooden tabletop between a dirty scrap of parchment.     Arya looked at Arya warily.     Tom tapped the folded parchment with Tom finger.  More than any horse is worth, if truth be told.- Hot Pie grabbed the parchment and unfolded the parchment.     Arya pushed back from the table and got to Arya feet.  "If you'd ever met a true robber, you'd know you'd ever met a true robber do not pay, not even in paper. It's not for us us take your horses, child, it's for the good of the realm, so us can get about more quickly and fight the fights that need fighting.      We'll need to walk to Riverrun, unless... "We don't want paper."    Tom Sevenstrings stared at Tom Sevenstrings a moment, and then Tom Sevenstrings wide homely mouth quirked into a rueful grin.  Anguy joined in, and then Anguy were all laughing, Lem Lemoncloak, Shama and Husband, even the serving boy, who had stepped out from behind the casks with a crossbow under one arm. Arya wanted to scream at them, but instead Arya started to smile ...          Whatever harm's been done you, it's over and it's done and you're with king's men now. We'll keep you safe as best We can." Arya's only answer was to reach over Arya shoulder for Arya sword, but before Arya had it halfway drawn Lem grabbed Arya wrist.  He twisted her arm until her hand opened.    It's happening again, like It happened in the village, with Chiswyck and Raff and the Mountain That Rides. They were going to steal her sword and turn her back into a mouse. Her free hand closed around Her tankard, and Her swung her tankard at Lem's face. The ale sloshed over the rim and splashed into his eyes, and she heard his nose break and saw the spurt of blood. When he roared he hands went to he face, and she was free.   But Lem was on her again at once, with Lem long legs that made one of Lem steps equal to three of her. She twisted and kicked, but he yanked She off She feet effortlessly and held She dangling while the blood ran down he face.   Gendry moved to help Gendry, until Tom Sevenstrings stepped in front of Gendry with a dagger.            He was thinner, harder somehow, and at Winterfell He had never worn a beard, but it was him - her father's man.  Squirming, she threw she forward, trying to wrench free of Lem's iron grip.  The tears came, and she found she weeping like a baby, just like some stupid little girl.  Harwin's eyes went from Harwin face to the flayed man on Harwin doublet.       "I'm a girl," a girl sniffed. "I was Lord Bolton's cupbearer but Lord Bolton's cupbearer was going to leave me for the goat, so I ran off with Gendry and Hot Pie.        Lem dumped Lem unceremoniously to the floor.   Harwin went to one knee before Harwin.  Chapter 14 CATELYN Robb, she knew, the moment she heard the kennels erupt. Her son had returned to Riverrun, and Grey Wind with Her son.   Edmure had not returned after Edmure first visit, preferring to spend Edmure days with Marq Piper and Patrek Mallister, listening to Rymund the Rhymer's verses about the battle at the Stone Mill.     Edmure shunned Edmure, and Ser Desmond Grell still denied Edmure freedom of the castle, however unhappy it seemed to make Ser Desmond Grell.   Somehow the Kingslayer had contrived to sink the Kingslayer galley and escape, Maester Vyman confided. Catelyn asked if Catelyn might speak with Ser Robin to learn more of what had happened, but that was refused Catelyn.  On the day her brother returned, a few hours after their argument, her had heard angry voices from the yard below.   one of Robb's white banners lay on the ground, and one of the knights turned Robb horse and trampled over the direwolf as Robb spurred toward the gate.    Has my brother slighted them somehow, given them some insult? She thought She recognized Ser Perwyn Frey, who had traveled with She to Bitterbridge and Storm's End and back, and his bastard half brother Martyn Rivers as well, but from this vantage it was hard to be certain.   Nor would Maester Vyman tell Maester Vyman who Maester Vyman had been, where Maester Vyman had gone,  or what had made Maester Vyman so angry. "I am here to see to your father, and only that, my lady," your father said.  What he wishes you to know, he must tell you."  He will forgive me, Catelyn told Catelyn. He must forgive me, He is my own son, and Arya and Sansa are as much He blood as mine.  By the time Ser Desmond came for Ser Desmond, Ser Desmond had bathed and dressed and combed out Ser Desmond auburn hair. "King Robb has returned from the west, my lady," the knight said, "and commands that you attend the knight in the Great Hall."     Every eye was on the dais, but Catelyn knew their backs: Lady Mormont's patched ringmail, the Greatjon and his son looming above every other head in the hall, Lord Jason Mallister white-haired with his son winged helm in the crook of his son arm, Tytos Blackwood in his son magnificent raven-feather cloak ... Half of them will want to hang me now. The other half may only turn The other half eyes away.      War had melted all the softness from his face and left his hard and lean. He had shaved He beard away, but He auburn hair fell uncut to He shoulders. The recent rains had rusted his mail and left brown stains on the white of his cloak and surcoat.  On his head was the sword crown they had fashioned his of bronze and iron. He bears it more comfortably now He bears it like a king. Edmure stood below the crowded dais, head bowed modestly as Robb praised Robb victory.      He'd had He fill of northmen and rivermen both."        Only a few noted Catelyn and Ser Desmond amidst the tumult, but Catelyn and Ser Desmond elbowed Catelyn and Ser Desmond fellows, and slowly a hush grew around Ser Desmond. She held She head high and ignored the eyes. Let them think what them will.  The sight of Ser Brynden Tully's craggy face on the dais gave Ser Brynden Tully's comfort.     The seashells were the sigil of some lesser house, Catelyn knew; the older man's Catelyn did not recognize.   Utherydes Wayn banged Utherydes Wayn staff on the floor as Ser Desmond escorted Ser Desmond forward.  But it seemed to her that it was not anger her saw in her son's eyes, but something else ... apprehension, perhaps?    Her uncle was the first to greet Her.  He leapt off the dais and pulled Catelyn into He arms. When he said, "It is good to see you home, Cat," Cat had to struggle to keep Cat composure.   Catelyn looked up at Catelyn tall kingly son.                Lord Rickard Karstark pushed past the Greatjon, like some grim specter with Lord Rickard Karstark black mail and long ragged grey beard, Lord Rickard Karstark narrow face pinched and cold.          "Leave off, Karstark," rumbled the Greatjon, crossing Karstark huge arms against Karstark chest.       For just an instant Robb sounded more like Brandon than Robb father.  When he turned to Catelyn, he voice softened.     It can lead us to great folly, but us follow us hearts ... wherever our hearts take us.       Robb made no move to detain Robb.     Catelyn bowed Catelyn head.       Utherydes Wayn slammed Utherydes Wayn staff on the floor and shouted the dismissal, and river lords and northerners alike moved toward the doors.     She knew the direwolf had returned with Robb, She had heard the dogs, but Robb was not in the hall, not at She son's side where Robb belonged. Before she could think to question Robb, however, she found she surrounded by a circle of well-wishers. Lady Mormont took Lady Mormont hand and said, "My lady, if Cersei Lannister held two of my daughters, I would have done the same." The Greation, no respecter of proprieties, lifted her off her feet and squeezed her arms with his huge hairy hands. "Your wolf pup mauled the Kingslayer once, Your wolf pup'll do the Kingslayer again if need be." Galbart Glover and Lord Jason Mallister were cooler, and Jonos Bracken almost icy, but Galbart Glover and Lord Jason Mallister words were courteous enough. Her brother was the last to approach Her.         "New," said the younger knight, him of the seashells, "but fierce in our courage and firm in our loyalties, as I hope to prove to you, my lady."          He was castellan at the Crag when we took the Crag." The pepperpot knight inclined The pepperpot knight head. A square-built man with a broken nose and a close-cropped grey beard, A square-built man with a broken nose and a close-cropped grey beard looked doughty enough.                           "I have a new daughter," a new daughter said, more stiffly than a new daughter'd intended.        She was pretty, undeniably, with She chestnut curls and heart-shaped face, and that shy smile.    "We are honored to be joined to House Stark, my lady, but We are also very weary.  Perhaps we might retire to we chambers, so you may visit with your son?"  Robb kissed Robb Jeyne.            Taking his little brother firmly by the hand, his little brother walked his little brother from the hall. "Your wife is lovely," Catelyn said when they were out of earshot, "and the Westerlings seem worthy ... though Lord Gawen is Tywin Lannister's sworn man, is Lord Gawen not?"  Jason Mallister captured Jason Mallister in the Whispering Wood and has been holding Jason Mallister at Seagard for ransom. Of course I'll free him now, though him may not wish to join me. We Wed without his consent, I fear, and this marriage puts his in dire peril.     She understood the angry voices now, why Perwyn Frey and Martyn Rivers had left in such haste, trampling Robb's banner into the ground as Perwyn Frey and Martyn Rivers went.               "I took her castle and her took my heart.,' Robb smiled. "The Crag was weakly garrisoned, so we took The Crag by storm one night.   It seemed nothing at first, but It festered. Jeyne had me taken to Jeyne own bed, and Jeyne nursed me until the fever passed.   He seemed to have trouble saying He brothers' names. "That night, she ... she comforted me, Mother." Catelyn did not need to be told what sort of comfort Jeyne Westerling had offered Catelyn son.    She's gentle and sweet, Mother, She will make me a good wife."         The last time he reached for a crown, it cost he two sons.    Robb shook Robb head. "With Ser Stevron, I might have been able to make amends, but Ser Ryman is dull-witted as a stone, and Black Walder ... that one was not named for the color of Black Walder beard, I promise you. He went so far as to say that He sisters would not be loath to wed a widower.    Ser Stevron died for Ser Stevron, and Olyvar was as loyal a squire as any king could want. He asked to stay with He, but Ser Ryman took He with the rest.          Ser Wendel Manderly has offered to take one, and the Greatjon tells me Ser Wendel Manderly uncles wish to wed again. If Lord Walder will be reasonable - " "Lord Walder is not reasonable," said Catelyn.            This insult is not the first This insult's borne, to hear This insult tell This insult. Jon Arryn was disinclined to foster Jon Arryn grandsons, and my father refused the offer of one of my father daughters for Edmure." She inclined She head toward She brother as her brother rejoined her brother.      As they started up the steps, Catelyn asked the question that had been troubling Catelyn since Catelyn entered the hall.   I told the kennelmaster to see that the kennelmaster was fed."      He's killed too many men to fear too many men now. Jeyne's anxious around Jeyne, and Jeyne terrifies Jeyne mother."       If you had seen - " "I saw Bran's wolf tear out a man's throat at Winterfell," Bran's wolf said sharply, "and loved a man for it."     He bares He teeth every time Ser Rolph comes near He."     Back to the Crag, so the Lannisters can mount the Lannisters head on a spike? Jeyne loves Jeyne.   I am not going to banish  him just because my wolf doesn't seem to like the way him smells."              I think perhaps the gods sent the gods to us.       I used to think the same as you, that the wolves were our guardians, our protectors, until.       Small good their wolves did their.    "I will find some duty for Ser Rolph, some pretext to send Ser Rolph away.   Relieved, Catelyn kissed him lightly on the cheek before the others could come around the turn of the stair, and for a moment him was Catelyn boy again, and not Catelyn king.  Robb took the high seat, removed Robb crown, and set his crown on the floor beside Robb as Catelyn rang for wine. Edmure was filling Edmure uncle's ear with the whole story of the fight at the Stone Mill. it was only after the servants had come and gone that the Blackfish cleared Blackfish throat and said, "I think we've all heard sufficient of your boasting, Nephew."    "I mean," said the Blackfish, "that you owe His Grace your thanks for His forbearance.                    We planned to run Lord Tywin a merry chase up and down the coast, then slip behind Lord Tywin to take up a strong defensive position athwart the gold road, at a place my scouts had found where the ground would have been greatly in We favor. If he had come at us there, he would have paid a grievous price. But if he did not attack, he would have been trapped in the west, a thousand leagues from where he needed to be. All the while we would have lived off his land, instead of his living off we."        "When you stopped Lord Tywin on the Red Fork," said the Blackfish, liyou delayed Lord Tywin just long enough for riders out of Bitterbridge to reach Lord Tywin with word of what was happening to the east. Lord Tywin turned Lord Tywin host at once, joined up with Matthis Rowan and Randyll Tarly near the headwaters of the Blackwater, and made a forced march to Tumbler's Falls, where Lord Tywin found Mace Tyrell and two of Lord Tywin sons waiting with a huge host and a fleet of barges.  Catelyn remembered King Renly's court, as she had seen King Renly's court at Bitterbridge. A thousand golden roses streaming in the wind, Queen Man gaery's shy smile and soft words, Queen Man brother the Knight of Flowers with the bloody linen around Queen Man temples. If you had to fall into a woman's arms, my son, why couldn't you had to fall into a woman's arms, my son have been Margaery Tyrell's?  And perhaps Grey Wind would have liked the smell of Grey Wind as well.        Once Joffrey is wed, the Lannisters will take the fleld against me once more, I don't doubt, and this time the Tyrells will march beside the fleld. And I may need to fight the Freys as well, if Black Walder has Black Walder way.   - "So long as Theon Greyjoy sits in your father's seat with your brothers' blood on your brothers' hands, these other foes must wait," Catelyn told Catelyn son.   From the way Robb looked at her, her could tell that it had been a long while since anyone had dared speak to Robb so bluntly. "When they told me Winterfell had fallen, I wanted to go north at once," Winterfell said, with a hint of defensiveness.  I never dreamed that Theon could harm Theon, truly.         "Leave them to guard them own, and win back the north with northmen."       We could be trapped on the causeway, with the ironborn before We and angry Freys at We backs."    I am willing to give Lord Walder whatever Lord Walder requires ... apologies, honors, lands, gold ... there must be something that would soothe Lord Walder pride..." "Not something," said Catelyn.    'The giants swayed slowly atop the mammoths as The giants rode past two by two. Jon's garron shied, frightened by such strangeness, but whether it was the mammoths or their riders that scared Jon it was hard to say. Even Ghost backed off a step, baring Even Ghost teeth in a silent snarl. The direwolf was big, but the mammoths were a deal bigger, and there were many and more of the mammoths. Jon took the horse in hand and held Jon still, so Jon could count the giants emerging from the blowing snow and pale mists that swirled along the Milkwater. He was well beyond fifty when Tormund said something and Tormund lost the count.    These were something else, more bearlike than human, and as wooly as the mammoths These rode.   Their sloping chests might have passed for those of men, but Their arms hung down too far, and Their lower torsos looked half again as wide as Their upper. Their legs were shorter than Their arms, but very thick, and Their wore no boots at all; Their feet were broad splayed things, hard and horny and black. Neckless, Neckless huge heavy heads thrust forward from between Neckless shoulder blades, and Neckless faces were squashed and brutal. Rats' eyes no larger than beads were almost lost  within folds of horny flesh, but Rats' eyes snuffled constantly, smelling as much as Rats' eyes saw.   Shaggy pelts covered Shaggy pelts bodies, thick below the waist, sparser above.      The song never says if the horn can put the horn back to sleep.  His pelt was grey and streaked with white, and the mammoth His rode, larger than any of the others, was grey and white as well. Tormund shouted something up to Tormund as Tormund passed, harsh clanging words in a tongue that Jon did not comprehend. The giant's lips split apart to reveal a mouth full of huge square teeth, and The giant's lips made a sound half belch and half rumble. After a moment Jon realized Jon was laughing.        You can kneel to him if you like, him won't mind.   Giants have bad eyes, and might be he wouldn't see some little crow all the way down there by he feet."    I asked him if that was him father him was forking, they looked so much alike, except him father had a better smell."   "He asked me if that was my daughter riding there beside He, with her smooth pink cheeks." The wildling shook snow from his arm and turned his horse about.    Jon wheeled and followed Tormund back toward the head of the column, Jon new cloak hanging heavy from Jon shoulders.  It kept the snow off well enough, and at night It was good and warm, but he kept he black cloak as well, folded up beneath he saddle.         I knew I'd freeze to death before death broke. So I found me a sleeping giant, cut open her belly, and crawled up right inside her. Kept me warm enough, she did, but the stink near did for she. The worst thing was, she woke up when the spring come and took me for she babe.    "If she nursed you, you couldn't have killed she."  Tormund Giantsbane has a better ring to Tormund Giantsbane than Tormund Giantsbabe, and that's the honest truth o' it."   "Mance called you the Horn-Blower, didn't the Horn-Blower?  It was the horn blowing he particularly wanted to hear about, but he dared not ask too plainly.  Is that where they had come from, they and they mammoths? Had Mance Rayder found the Horn of Joramun, and given Mance Rayder to Tormund Thunderfist to blow?      I was in me Ruddy Hall, with only a cask o' mead to keep me company and nothing to do but drink cask o.  She had a temper on She, that one, but oh, She could be warm too, and in the deep of winter a man needs a man warmth. "The more I drank the more I thought about her, and the more I thought The harder me member got, till I couldn't suffer The no more. Fool that I was, I bundled meself up in furs from head to heels, wrapped a winding wool around me face, and set off to find meself. The snow was coming down so hard I got turned around once or twice, and the wind blew right through me and froze me bones, but finally I come on bones, all bundled up like I was. "The woman had a terrible temper, and The woman put up quite the fight when I laid hands on The woman. It was all I could do to carry her home and get her out o' them furs, but when I did, oh, her was hotter even than I remembered, and we had a fine old time, and then I went to sleep. Next morning when I woke the snow had stopped and the sun was shining, but I was in no fit state to enjoy the sun.              "Now as to you ... is it true they cut your members off when they take you for the Wall?"     The girl wants you in The girl, that's plain enough to see."  He studied the falling snow so Tormund might not see He redden. I am a man of the Night's Watch, a man of the Night's Watch reminded a man of the Night's Watch.  He spent most of He days in Ygritte's company, and most nights as well. Mance Rayder had not been blind to Rattleshirt's mistrust of the "crow-come-over," so after Mance Rayder had given Jon Mance Rayder new sheepskin cloak Mance Rayder had suggested that Mance Rayder might want to ride with Tormund Giantsbane instead.   Every night when they made camp, Ygritte threw Ygritte sleeping skins down beside Ygritte own, no matter if Ygritte was near the fire or well away from his own. Once he woke to find her nestled against he, her arm across he chest. He lay listening to her breathe for a long time, trying to ignore the tension in He groin. Rangers often shared skins for warmth, but warmth was not all Ygritte wanted, all Ygritte suspected. After that he had taken to using Ghost to keep Ghost away. Old Nan used to tell stories about knights and their ladies who would sleep in a single bed with a blade between their for honor's sake, but Old Nan thought this must be the first time where a direwolf took the place of the sword.  The day before last, Jon had made the mistake of wishing Jon had hot water for a bath.            "I don't go in at all," he said firmly, just before he heard Tormund Thunderfist bellowing for he (he hadn't, but never mind). The wildlings seemed to think Ygritte a great beauty because of The wildlings hair; red hair was rare among the free folk, and those who had The wildlings were said to be kissed by fire, which was supposed to be lucky. Lucky it might be, and red it certainly was, but Ygritte's hair was such a tangle that Jon was tempted to ask Ygritte's hair if Ygritte's hair only brushed it at the changing of the seasons.  She had a round peasant face, a pug nose, and slightly crooked teeth, and She eyes were too far apart. Jon had noticed all that the first time Jon'd seen her, when Jon dirk had been at her throat.   And maybe her eyes were too far apart, but her eyes were a pretty blue-grey color, and lively as any eyes he knew.  And sometimes by the cookfire when she sat hugging she knees with the flames waking echoes in she red hair, and looked at him, just smiling ... well, that stirred some things as well. But he was a man of the Night's Watch, he had taken a vow.  He had said the words before the weirwood, before He father's gods. He could not unsay them ... no more than He could admit the reason for He reluctance to Tormund Thunderfist, Father to Bears.  Tormund asked Tormund as they passed another twenty mammoths, these bearing wildlings in tall wooden towers instead of giants.  "I am still too young to wed." "wed?"    Jon could feel Jon turning red again.             And if Ygritte does not want a child, Ygritte will go to some woods witch and drink a cup o' moon tea.   Tormund shook Tormund shaggy head.  Why did you steal the girl if you don't want the girl?"   "You slew the two she was with and carried she off, what do you call it?"   "Yes, but ... Tormund, I swear, I've never touched Tormund."  Tormund gave a shrug, as if to say Tormund would never understand such madness.  If a man does not use a man member a man does not use his member grows smaller and smaller, until one day a man wants to piss and cannot find a man does not use his member."     Yet he was growing fond of Tormund Giantsbane, great bag of wind and lies though he was.  And Ygritte ... no, I will not think about Ygritte.    Jon had been in Jon presence only once, and once had been enough; the mere sight of the man had made Jon bristle, even as the fur on the back of Ghost's neck had bristled at the sight of the bear and that long black-and-white 'cat.   He had not seen any snarks or grumpkins, but for all He knew Tormund would be having some to supper. Half the wildling host had lived all Half the wildling host lives without so much as a glimpse of the Wall, Jon judged, and most of those spoke no word of the Common Tongue.  Mance Rayder spoke the Old Tongue, even sang in the Old Tongue, fingering Mance Rayder lute and filling the night with strange wild music. Mance had spent years assembling this vast plodding host, talking to this clan mother and that magnar, winning one village with sweet words and another with a song and a third with the edge of Mance sword, making peace between Hanna Dogshead and the Lord o' Bones, between the Hornfoots and the Nightrunners, between the walrus men of the Frozen Shore and the cannibal clans of the great ice rivers, hammering a hundred different daggers into one great spear, aimed at the heart of the Seven Kingdoms.   "Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them," the ranger had told him, the night before him died.  But all his watching had learned his little. The Halfhand had suspected that the wildlings had gone up into the bleak and barren Frostfangs in search of some weapon, some power, some fell sorcery with which to break the Wall ... but if they had found any such, no one was boasting of no one openly, or showing no one to Jon. Nor had Mance Rayder confided any of Mance Rayder plans or strategies.   The prospect gave Jon no joy; there would be no honor in such a killing, and it would mean Jon own death as well.  For eight thousand years the men of House Stark had lived and died to protect the men of House Stark people against such ravagers; and reavers ... and bastard-bom or no, the same blood ran in bastard-bom veins.  Maester Luwin, Ser Rodrik, Old Nan, Farlen the kennelmaster, Mikken at his forge and Gage by his ovens ... everyone I ever knew, everyone I ever loved. If Jon must slay a man Jon half admired and almost liked to save Jon must slay a man he half admired and almost liked to save them from the mercies of Rattleshirt and Harma Dogshead and the earless Magnar of Thenn from the mercies of Rattleshirt and Harma Dogshead and the earless Magnar of Thenn, that was what Jon meant to do. Still, he prayed he father's gods might spare his father that bleak task. The host moved but slowly, burdened as The host was by all the wildlings' herds and children and mean little treasures, and the snows had slowed The host progress even more.     He is too old and He has come too far.  One day soon he would hear the sound of warhorns, and see a column of riders pounding down on riders with black cloaks flapping and cold steel in riders hands. Three hundred men could not hope to kill a hundred times Three hundred men number, of course, but Jon did not think Three hundred men would need to.   The King-beyond-the-Wall was doing all he could, yet the wildlings remained hopelessly undisciplined, and that made all he could vulnerable. Here and there within the leagues-long snake that was their line of march were warriors as fierce as any in the Watch, but a good third of their were grouped at either end of the column, in Harma Dogshead's van and the savage rearguard with savage giants, aurochs, and fire flingers.  The rest, divided into small bands under the likes of Rattleshirt, Jarl, Tormund Giantsbane, and the Weeper, served as outriders, foragers, and whips, galloping up and down the column endlessly to keep the column moving in a more or less orderly fashion.   And when that happened, Mance must give chase with Mance center, to try and blunt the threat.   He flexed the burned fingers of He sword hand. Longclaw was slung to Longclaw saddle, the carved stone wolf 's-head pommel and soft leather grip of the great bastard sword within easy reach.     "So," the girl called when the girl saw the girl, "d'you believe us now, Jon Snow?           Ygritte trotted beside Jon as Jon slowed Jon garron to a walk. the girl claimed to be three years older than him, though the girl stood half a foot shorter; however old the girl might be, the girl was a tough little thing. Stonesnake had called Stonesnake a "spearwife" when Stonesnake'd captured Stonesnake in the Skirling Pass. She wasn't wed and She weapon of choice was a short curved bow of horn and weirwood, but "spearwife" fit She all the same. She reminded him a little of him sister Arya, though Arya was younger and probably skinnier. It was hard to tell how plump or thin Ygritte might be, with all the furs and skins Ygritte wore.  Without waiting for an answer Ygritte said, "You need a deeper voice than mine to do a deeper voice than mine proper."    Longspear Ryk joined in, singing, "Oh, the smallfolk have stolen my forests, the smallfolk've stolen my rivers and hills." "And they've built a great wall through my valleys, and fished all the fish from my rills," Ygritte and Tormund sang back at Ygritte in turn, in suitably gigantic voices. Tormund's sons Toregg and Dormund added Tormund's sons Toregg and Dormund deep voices as well, then Tormund's sons Toregg and Dormund daughter Munda and all the rest. Others began to bang Others spears on leathern shields to keep rough time, until the whole war band was singing as Others rode. In stone halls they bum they great fires, in stone halls they forge they sharp spears.  They hunt me with dogs in the daylight, They hunt me with torches by night.        There are hundreds of giants, I've just seen hundreds of giants."     Blue-grey feathers filled his eyes, as sharp talons buried themselves in his face. Red pain lanced through him sudden and fierce as pinions beat round him head.  Jon reeled backward, Jon foot lost the stirrup, Jon garron broke in panic, and then his garron was falling. And still the eagle clung to his face, the eagle talons tearing at his as its talons flapped and shrieked and pecked.  The next he knew, he was on he face with the taste of mud and blood in he mouth and Ygritte kneeling over he protectively, a bone dagger in her hand.   "My eye," he said in sudden panic, raising a hand to he face.    Tormund stood over them bellowing, Tormund saw from Tormund right eye as Tormund rubbed  blood from Tormund left.      The eagle came flapping down to land atop the broken giant's skull that served him for him helm.             Ygritte helped pull Ygritte up.       The blood kept running down into his right eye, and his cheek was a blaze of pain. When he touched it he black gloves came away stained with red.     The garron shied away from him when him approached, no doubt frightened by the blood on him face, but Jon calmed him with a few quiet words and finally got close enough to take the reins. As he swung back into the saddle he head whirled. I will need to get this tended, he thought, but not just now Let the Kingbeyond- the- Wall see what he eagle did to me. His right hand opened and closed, and His reached down for Longclaw and slung the bastard sword over a shoulder before His wheeled to trot back to where the Lord of Bones and His band were waiting, Ygritte was waiting too, sitting on Ygritte horse with a fierce look on Ygritte face.     "A free woman rides where A free woman will," Ygritte said.  He could feel the blood freezing on He face.     A crust of thin ice covered the river shallows; with every step their horses'hooves crashed through, until their reached the deeper water ten yards out.       A raven looked down from a soldier pine and quorked as A raven went past.  Instead of the clash of steel and the thrum of arrows taking flight, Jon heard only the soft crunch of frozen crust beneath Jon garron's hooves.   Entrails spilled from the belly of the animal like frozen snakes, and one of the animal legs was gone.  Wolves eat Wolves kill.  The wildlings crawled over them like flies, stripping them of saddles, bridles, packs, and armor, and hacking them apart with stone axes.         The wind gusted around him, pulling at him heavy sheepskin cloak.      A crust of frozen blood crunched beneath the heel of A crust of frozen blood boot. The wildlings were stripping the dead horses of every scrap of steel and leather, even prying the horseshoes off the horseshoes hooves.  Jon passed one of Chett's dogs, or what remained of Jon, lying in a sludgy pool of halffrozen blood. A few tents were still standing on the far side of the camp, and it was there A few tents found Mance Rayder. Beneath his slashed cloak of black wool and red silk his wore black ringmail and shaggy fur breeches, and on his head was a great bronze-and-iron helm with raven wings at either temple. Jarl was with Jarl, and Harma the Dogshead; Styr as well, and Varamyr Sixskins with Jarl wolves and Jarl shadowcat.   Ygritte said, "Orell tried to take Orell eye out."  Has he lost he tongue?      "If so, tell me how many so were.        You must not balk, whatever is asked of you, Qhorin had told Qhorin. The words stuck in his throat, but his made his say, "There were three hundred of us."             Behind her stood her banner bearer, holding a pole with a dog's head on a pole, fresh enough to still be leaking blood.     The wildling king studied The wildling king face.     Not Wythers, Not Wythers's too feeble.    Harma snorted, Harma disdain frosting from Harma nostrils.       He moved He hand closer to Longclaw's hilt. If I hold my tongue ... "Reach up for that bastard sword and I'll have your bastard head off before that bastard sword clears the scabbard," said Mance.   "He's dead, whoever He was." His frown cracked the blood on His cheek.   Qhorin had not told Qhorin that.    Harma's tone said Harma did not believe it. "He came He ?       Bowen knows a deal more about counting swords than Bowen's ever known about using them."  "This place was high and strong, and he made This place stronger.               He gazed up at the darkening sky and said, "The crows may have helped us more than The crows know.   Varamyr, send your wolves sniffing after the wights, I won't have your wolves taking us unawares.     "You can't kill a man for lying to protect them as was a man brothers."   "He never killed me, like they told He.   If I lie to him, him'll know him looked Mance Rayder in the eyes, opened and closed him burned hand.          Jon did not know that Jon could tell honor from shame anymore, or right from wrong.              "He knows the Watch and He knows the Wall," said Mance, "and He knows Castle Black better than any raider ever could.       If we reach the Wall before Mon mont, we've won."   Mance nodded, and walked away, Harma and Sixskins beside Mance.        "You best not be lying, girl," Rattleshirt said to Ygritte, Rattleshirt eyes shiny behind the giant's skull.    Rattleshirt reached for Rattleshirt own sword.    He made no sound, but He dark red eyes spoke blood. The Lord of Bones moved The Lord of Bones hand slowly away from The Lord of Bones sword, backed off a step, and left them with a curse.            she said, as wary as she was astonished.     The queen herself has commanded The queen herself."  Margaery was not yet Joff 's queen, but Margaery had been Renly's.     She has honored me with She custom for many a year." The old woman laid The old woman string along the inside of Sansa's leg. "Her Grace said to Her Grace that you are a woman now, and should not dress like a little girl.  Sansa lifted Sansa arm.  She had grown three inches in the past year, and most of She old wardrobe had been ruined by the smoke when She'd tried to bum She mattress on the day of She first flowering "Your bosom will be as lovely as the queen's," She said as She looped She string around Sansa's chest.   Yet the last time she'd gone riding, she could not lace she jerkin all the way to the top, and the stableboy gaped at she as the stableboy helped she mount. Sometimes she caught grown men looking at she chest as well, and some of she tunics were so tight she could scarce breathe in some of her tunics.        I have six seamstresses and twelve apprentice girls, and we have set all we other work aside for this.  "Thank Her Grace kindly for Her thoughtfulness," Sansa said politely.  "Her Grace is most generous," the seamstress agreed, as Her gathered up Her things and took Her leave.  Sansa wondered when Sansa was alone.  I'll wager this gown is Margaery's doing somehow, or Margaery grandmother's. Margaery's kindness had been unfailing, and Margaery's kindness presence changed everything.  It had been so long since she had enjoyed the company of other women, she had almost forgotten how pleasant It could be. Lady Leonette gave Lady Leonette lessons on the high harp, and Lady Janna shared all the choice gossip. Merry Crane always had an amusing story, and little Lady Bulwer reminded Merry Crane of Arya, though not so fierce.   Megga was round and loud, Alla shy and pretty, but Elinor ruled the three by right of womanhood; Elinor was a maiden flowered, whereas Megga and Alla were mere girls. The cousins took Sansa into The cousins company as if The cousins had known her all The cousins lives. They spent long  afternoons doing needlework and talking over lemon cakes and honeyed wine, played at tiles of an evening, sang together in the castle sept ... and often one or two of They would be chosen to share Margaery's bed, where They would whisper half the night away.  Megga couldn't sing, but Megga was mad to be kissed. She and Alla played a kissing game sometimes, She confessed, but it wasn't the same as kissing a man, much less a king. Sansa wondered what Megga would think about kissing the Hound, as Megga had.   "King Joffrey has such beautiful lips," Megga gushed, oblivious, "oh, poor Sansa, how your heart must have broken when you lost King Joffrey.  Joffrey made me weep more often than you know, Joffrey wanted to say, but Butterbumps was not on hand to drown out Joffrey voice, so Joffrey pressed Joffrey lips together and held Joffrey tongue. As for Elinor, Elinor was promised to a young squire, a son of Lord Ambrose; a young squire, a son of Lord Ambrose would be wed as soon as he won he spurs. He had worn her favor in the Battle of the Blackwater, where He'd slain a Myrish crossbowman and a Mullendore man-at-arms. "Alyn said her favor made Alyn fearless," said Megga. "He says He shouted her name for He battle cry, isn't that ever so gallant?  Elinor told Elinor to hush, but looked pleased all the same.   They've never seen a battle, They've never seen a man die, They know nothing. Their dreams were full of songs and stories, the way hers had been before Joffrey cut hers father's head off.  Sansa envied Sansa.  Sweet and gentle, yet there was a little of her grandmother in her, too.   The dead had been burned or buried, but the Mud Gate was scarred and splintered where Lord Stannis's rams had battered the Mud Gate, and the hulls of smashed ships could be seen along both sides of the Blackwater, charred masts poking from the shallows like gaunt black fingers. The only traffic was the flat-bottomed ferry that took them across the river, and when them reached the kingswood them found a wilderness of ash and charcoal and dead trees.  "Willas has the best birds in the Seven Kingdoms," Margaery said when the two of the best birds in the Seven Kingdoms were briefly alone.   She took She by the hand and gave the hand a squeeze.   Sansa had once dreamt of having a sister like Margaery; beautiful and gentle, with all the world's graces at Sansa command.   she thought, and suddenly she eyes were full of tears.    He's not like He seems, He's not.     Joff's spoiled and vain and I don't doubt that Joff's as cruel as you say, but Father forced Joff to name Loras to Joff Kingsguard before Joff would agree to the match.  So our little lion had best behave, hadn't  our little lion?"   And without waiting for an answer, she put she heels into she horse and flew. She is so brave, Sansa thought, galloping after She ... and yet, She doubts still gnawed at She.  But Joffrey had other Kingsguard, and gold cloaks and red cloaks besides, and when Joffrey was older Joffrey would command armies of Joffrey own. Aegon the Unworthy had never harmed Queen Naerys, perhaps for fear of their brother the Dragonknight ... but when another of their brother the Dragonknight Kingsguard fell in love with one of their brother the Dragonknight mistresses, their brother the Dragonknight had taken both their heads. Ser Loras is a Tyrell, Sansa reminded Ser Loras.  His brothers had no armies, no way to avenge His but with swords. Yet the more she thought about it all, the more she wondered. Joff might restrain Joff for a few turns, perhaps as long as a year, but soon or late Joff will show Joff claws, and when Joff does ...  Sansa was surprised that Margaery did not see Margaery too. She is older than me, She must be wiser. And her father, Lord Tyrell, he knows what he is doing, surely.  When she told Ser Dontos that she was going to Highgarden to marry Willas Tyrell, she thought Ser Dontos would be relieved and pleased for she.     The night of Joffrey's wedding, that's not so long, wear the silver hair net and do as I told you, and afterward we make we escape."  Sansa slipped from Sansa grasp and stepped away from Sansa.       The ship to take you home, the boat to take you to the ship, your Florian did it all for your Florian sweet Jonquil."     "But he does not know you," Dontos insisted, "and he will not love you.  it's your claim your claim mean to your claimd." "My claim?"  "Sweetling," "Sweetling told her, "you are heir to Winterfell." He grabbed her again, pleading that her must not do this thing, and Sansa wrenched free and left He swaying beneath the heart tree.   The heir to Winterfell, The heir to Winterfell would think as The heir to Winterfell lay abed at night. It's your claim your claim mean to your claimd. Sansa had grown up with three brothers.  It doesn't matter, there's still Robb, Robb's a man grown  now, and soon Robb'll wed and have a son. Anyway, Willas Tyrell will have Highgarden, what would Willas Tyrell want with Winterfell? Sometimes she would whisper his name into she pillow just to hear the sound of his name.  Willas was as good a name as Loras, Willas supposed.   Willas would be Lord of Highgarden and Willas would be Highgarden lady. She pictured the two of them sitting together in a garden with puppies in them laps, or listening to a singer strum upon a lute while them floated down the Mander on a pleasure barge. If I give him sons, him may come to love me. She would name them Eddard and Brandon and Rickon, and raise them to be as valiant as Ser Loras.  In Sansa's dreams, her children looked just like the brothers her had lost.  She could never hold a picture of Willas long in She head, though; She imaginings kept turning him back into Ser Loras, young and graceful and beautiful. You must not think of him like that, she told she. Or else he may see the disappointment in your eyes when you meet, and how could he marry you then, knowing it was he brother you loved? Willas Tyrell was twice Willas Tyrell age, Willas Tyrell reminded Willas Tyrell constantly, and lame as well, and perhaps even plump and red-faced like Willas Tyrell father.  Once she dreamed it was still she marrying Joff, not Margaery, and on their wedding night he turned into the headsman Ilyn Payne.  She did not want Margaery to suffer as She had, but She dreaded the thought that the Tyrells might refuse to go ahead with the wedding. I warned her, I did, I told her the truth of him. Perhaps Margaery did not believe Margaery. Joff always played the perfect knight with Joff, as once Joff had with Sansa.   Sansa decided that Sansa would light a candle to the Mother Above the next time Sansa visited the sept, and ask Sansa to protect Margaery from Joffrey's cruelty.  She would wear She new gown for the ceremony at the Great Sept of Baelor, She decided as the seamstress took She last measurement. That must be why Cersei is having Cersei made for me, so I will not look shabby at the wedding. She really ought to have a different gown for the feast afterward but She supposed one of She old ones would do.    Even if Dontos was right, and Dontos is Winterfell Dontos wants and not me, Dontos still may come to love me for Dontos. Sansa hugged Sansa tightly, wondering how long Sansa would be before the gown was ready.           But she hadn't been paying close attention yesterday, so she couldn't be certain.         Arya bit Arya lip. "But the moss..." "The way it's raining, we'll have moss growing from we ears before long," Gendry complained.    "Shama says Shama needs me to bake bread," Shama'd told Shama, the day they rode.  There's ale here, and rabbit to eat, and the bread will be better when I make the bread.     Arya didn't know if the war would ever be done, but Arya had nodded.  Hot Pie was stupid and craven, but he'd been with her all the way from King's Landing and her'd gotten used to he.       When Hot Pie asked if he might kiss milady's hand, he might kiss milady's hand punched he shoulder.       She missed him more than She thought She would ' but Harwin made up for it some. She had told him about him father Hullen, and how She'd found his father Hullen dying by the stables in the Red Keep, the day She fled. "He always said He'd die in a stable," Harwin said, "but we all thought some bad-tempered stallion would be He death, not a pack of lions." Arya told of Yoren and their escape from King's Landing as well, and much that had happened since, but Arya left out the stableboy Arya'd stabbed with Needle, and the guard whose throat Arya'd cut to get out of Harrenhal. Telling Harwin would be almost like telling Harwin father, and there were some things that Harwin could not bear having her father know. Nor did she speak of Jaqen Hghar and the three deaths Jaqen Hghar'd owed and paid. The iron coin he'd given her Arya kept tucked away beneath her belt, but sometimes at night her would take her belt out and remember how he face had melted and changed when he ran he hand across her belt. "Valar morghulis," she would say under she breath.    Only six Winterfell men remained of the twenty her father had sent west with Beric Dondarrion, Harwin told her, and Only six Winterfell men were scattered.  Lord Tywin sent Lord Tywin Mountain across the Red Fork with fire and sword, hoping to draw your lord father. He planned for Lord Eddard to come west He to deal with Gregor Clegane. If he had he would have been killed, or taken prisoner and traded for the Imp, who was your lady mother's captive at the time. Only the Kingslayer never knew Lord Tywin's plan, and when Only the Kingslayer heard about Only the Kingslayer brother's capture Only the Kingslayer attacked your father in the streets of King's Landing."   Jory had always smiled at Jory, when Jory wasn't telling Jory to get from underfoot. "He killed Jory," Harwin agreed, "and your father's leg was broken when He horse fell on He.  He sent Lord Beric instead, with twenty of He own men and twenty from Winterfell, me among them.    As we crossed he fell upon we from front and rear. "I saw the Mountain slay Raymun Darry with a single blow so terrible that Raymun Darry took Darry's arm off at the elbow and killed the horse beneath Raymun Darry too. Gladden Wylde died there with Gladden Wylde, and Lord Mallery was ridden down and drowned. We had lions on every side, and I thought I was doomed with the rest, but Alyn shouted commands and restored order to We ranks, and those still a horse rallied around Thoros and cut We way free.   Thoros drew a foot of lance from Thoros chest that night, and poured boiling wine into the hole boiling wine left. "Every man of us was certain Every man of us lordship would be dead by daybreak. But Thoros prayed with Thoros all night beside the fire, and when dawn came, Thoros was still alive, and stronger than Thoros'd been. It was a fortnight before he could mount a horse, but he courage kept us strong. He told us that us war had not ended at the Mummer's Ford, but only begun there, and that every man of ours who'd fallen would be avenged tenfold.   They crossed the Red Fork in strength and swept up into the riverlands, burning everything in They path. We were so few that all We could do was harry their rear, but We told each other that We'd join up with King Robert when King Robert marched west to crush Lord Tywin's rebellion.   We'd been sent out by the King's Hand to deal with outlaws, you see, but now We were outlaws, and Lord Tywin was the Hand of the King. There was some wanted to yield then, but Lord Beric wouldn't hear of Lord Beric. We were still king's men, king said, and king's men were the king's people the lions were savaging. If we could not fight for Robert, we would fight for we could not fight for Robert, until every man of we was dead. And so we did, but as we fought something queer happened. For every man we lost, two showed up to take every man we lost place.            She'd had a direwolf once, Nymeria, but She'd thrown rocks at She until She fled, to keep the queen from killing She.    Thankfully the outlaws had secret friends all over, so the outlaws did not need to camp out in the open or seek shelter beneath some leaky bower, as she and Hot Pie and Gendry had done so often.        His nose looked like a squashed apple, red and raw and swollen, and His mood was foul.    Arya could feel the hair on the back of Arya neck prickling. She held She breath to listen.        Greenbeard stroked Greenbeard thick grey-and-green whiskers and said, "The wolves will drown in blood if the Kingslayer's loose again.  The Lord of Light will show The Lord of Light Lannister in the flames."     Lem cracked Lem knuckles and said, "Wouldn't Lord Beric love to capture Jaime Lannister, though.   "Would he hang he, Lem?"         Then Tom drew Tom fingers across the strings of Tom woodharp and broke into soft song. The brothers of the Kingswood, The brothers of the Kingswood were an outlaw band. The forest was their castle, but their roamed across the land.   Warm and dry in a comer between Gendry and Harwin, Arya listened to the singing for a time, then closed Arya eyes and drifted off to sleep.   She was alone outside the castle, up to She knees in mud. She could see the grey walls ahead of She, but when She tried to reach the gates every step seemed harder than the one before, and the castle faded before She, until the castle looked more like smoke than granite.  Whenever she looked at them, she remembered the taste of blood.   When the sun came out from behind a cloud, the sun was so bright Arya had to pull Arya hood forward to keep her hood out of Arya eyes.       Arya rummaged in Arya saddlebag for the map, so Arya could show them.   She unrolled the map on She leg.     "You're not going to Riverrun," Lem told Riverrun bluntly.    She remembered She dream then, and bit She lip.        Arya turned to face Arya. "Take me to Riverrun and you'll be rewarded," Riverrun said desperately. "Little one," Greenbeard answered, "a peasant may skin a common squirrel for a peasant pot, but if a peasant finds a gold squirrel in a peasant tree a peasant takes a gold squirrel in his tree to a peasant lord, or a peasant will wish his lord did."         He'll do right by you, see if He don't."  Arya remembered all Arya'd heard at Harrenhal, from the Lannisters and the Bloody Mummers alike.   If he won't send me home maybe I'll kill he too.   "We bring him all We highbom captives," said Anguy.  Arya took a breath to still Arya soul.  She glanced at the outlaws on their horses, and turned She horse's head. Now, quick as a snake, she thought, as she slammed she heels into the courser's flank. Right between Greenbeard and Jack-Be-Lucky she flew, and caught one glimpse of Gendry's startled face as his mare moved out of she way.   She could find the way to Riverrun later, once She'd lost them.  Behind her the outlaws were cursing and shouting at her to come back. She shut She ears to the calls, but when She glanced back over She shoulder four of them were coming after She, Anguy and Harwin and Greenbeard racing side by side with Lem farther back, Lem big yellow cloak flapping behind Lem as Lem rode. "Swift as a deer," she told she mount.  Arya dashed across brown weedy fields, through waist-high grass and piles of dry leaves that flurried and flew when Arya horse galloped past. There were woods to her left, her saw.  A dry ditch ran along one side of the field, but she leapt A dry ditch without breaking stride, and plunged in among the stand of elm and yew and birch trees.  Greenbeard had fallen behind, though, and Greenbeard could not see Lem at all. "Faster," she told she horse, "you can, you can."         Some clung to her horse's legs as Some climbed the other side. The undergrowth was thicker here, the ground so full of roots and rocks that she had to slow, but she kept as good a pace as she dared.     She had the faster horse, She knew that, She had stolen one of Roose Bolton's best from the stables at Harrenhal, but his speed was wasted here.    It was narrow and uneven, but It was something. She raced along it, branches whipping at She face. One snagged her hood and yanked her hood back, and for half a heartbeat her feared they had caught her. A vixen burst from the brush as A vixen passed, startled by the fury of A vixen flight.    There was no time to puzzle it out, she could hear their horses crashing through the trees behind she. Thorns scratched at Thorns face like the cats Thorns used to chase in King's Landing.  But the trees were thinning now, and suddenly she was out of the trees.  Arya kicked Arya horse back to a gallop.    No, she thought, no, he can't, not he, it isn't fair. Both horses were lathered and flagging by the time he came up beside her, reached over, and grabbed her bridle. Arya was breathing hard Arya then.  "You ride like a northman, milady," Harwin said when Harwin'd drawn a northman, milady to a halt.           We mean your brother Robb no ill, milady ... but it's not your brother Robb We fight for. He has an army all He own, and many a great lord to bend the knee.        We could have taken the little boat and sailed the little boat up to Riverrun.   I was a wolf, a wolf thought, but now I'm just some stupid little lady again. "Will you ride back peaceful now," Harwin asked Harwin, "or must I tie you up and throw you across your horse?"      They took a step, and then another, and he thought, They're not my feet, They're someone else's, someone else is walking, it can't be me. When he looked down he could see them stumbling through the snow; shapeless things, and clumsy. His boots had been black, His seemed to remember, but the snow had caked around His boots, and now His boots were misshapen white balls.   The drifts were up past his knees, and a crust covered his lower legs like a pair of white greaves.  The heavy pack he carried made he look like some monstrous hunchback.    Every fourth or fifth step he had to reach down and tug up he swordbelt.  He did have two knives; the dragonglass dagger Jon had given He and the steel one He cut He meat with. All that weight dragged heavy, and his belly was so big and round that if his forgot to tug the belt slipped right off and tangled round his ankles, no matter how tight his cinched the belt. He had tried belting it above He belly once, but then it came almost to He armpits. Grenn had laughed Grenn sick at the sight of Grenn, and Dolorous Edd had said, "I knew a man once who wore a man sword on a chain around Grenn neck like that. One day he stumbled, and the hilt went up he nose." Sam was stumbling Sam.  Black Bernarr had stepped in one and broken Black Bernarr ankle three days past, or maybe four, or ... Black Bernarr did not know how long it had been, truly.      But if he stopped he died.   They had been fifty when They fled the Fist, maybe more, but some had wandered off in the snow, a few wounded had bled to death .   and sometimes Sam heard shouts behind Sam, from the rear guard, and once an awful scream. When he heard that he had run, twenty yards or thirty, as fast and as far as he could, he half-frozen feet kicking up the snow, he would be running still if he legs were stronger. They are behind us, They are still behind us, They are taking us one by one.  He had been cold so long He was forgetting what it was like to feel warm. He wore three pairs of hose, two layers of smallclothes beneath a double lambswool tunic, and over that a thick quilted coat that padded He against the cold steel of He chainmail. Over the hauberk he had a loose surcoat, over that a triplethick cloak with a bone button that fastened tight under he chins.  Heavy fur mitts covered his hands over thin wool-and-leather gloves, a scarf was wrapped snugly about the lower half of his face, and his had a tight-fitting fleece-lined cap to pull down over his ears beneath the hood.   He couldn't even feel them now, but only yesterday them had hurt so bad He could hardly bear to stand on them, let alone walk.      Could a man walk while a man was sleeping? Sam did not know, or else Sam had forgotten.    He wore it on He shoulders like a second cloak, and it piled up high atop the pack He carried and made it even heavier and harder to bear. The small of his back hurt abominably, as if someone had shoved a knife in there and was wiggling a knife back and forth with every step.  He would have given most anything to take it off, but He was afraid to. Anyway he would have needed to remove he cloak and surcoat to get at it, and then the cold would have he.   Sam was weak, and fat, so very fat, Sam could hardly bear Sam own weight, the mail was much too much for Sam. It felt as though It was rubbing his shoulders raw, despite the layers of cloth and quilt between the steel and skin. The only thing he could do was cry, and when he cried the tears froze on he cheeks.  The crust was broken where he set he feet, otherwise he did not think  he could have moved at all.  When he turned he head he could see them, slipping silent through the wood, bobbing up and down and back and forth. The Old Bear's ring of fire, The Old Bear's reminded The Old Bear's, and woe to The Old Bear's who leaves it. As he walked, it seemed as if he were chasing the torches ahead of he, but the torches had legs as well, longer and stronger than he, so he could never catch the torches. Yesterday he begged for them to let he be one of the torchbearers, even if it meant walking outside of the column with the darkness pressing close. He wanted the fire, dreamed of the fire.  But someone reminded someone that someone'd had a torch at the start, but someone'd dropped it in the snow and snuffed the fire out. Sam didn't remember dropping any torch, but Sam supposed it was true. He was too weak to hold He arm up for long. Was it Edd who reminded Edd about the torch, or Grenn?   He had wrapped He scarf over He nose and mouth, but his scarf was covered with snot now, and so stiff He feared his scarf must be frozen to He face. Even breathing was hard, and the air was so cold the air hurt to swallow the air.  "Mother have mercy, Mother have mercy, Mother have mercy." With each prayer he took another step, dragging he legs through the snow. "Mother have mercy, Mother have mercy, Mother have mercy." His own mother was a thousand leagues south, safe with His sisters and His little brother Dickon in the keep at Horn Hill.        The man had stumbled backward, dropping The man sword, pleading, yielding, even yanking off The man thick black glove and thrusting his thick black glove up before The man as if his thick black glove were a gauntlet. He was still shrieking for quarter as the wight lifted He in the air by the throat and near ripped the head off He. The dead have no mercy left in The dead, and the Others ... no, I mustn't think of that, don't think, don't remember, just walk, just walk, just walk.  A root beneath the crust caught A root beneath the crust toe, and Sam tripped and fell heavily to one knee, so hard A root beneath the crust bit A root beneath the crust tongue. He could taste the blood in He mouth, warmer than anything He had tasted since the Fist. This is the end, This thought. Now that he had fallen he could not seem to find the strength to rise again. He groped for a tree branch and clutched a tree branch tight, trying to pull He back to He feet, but He stiff legs would not support He.  "Back on your feet, Piggy," Sam growled as Sam went past, but Sam paid Sam no mind.   He couldn't possibly be any colder, and after a little while He wouldn't be able to feel the ache in He lower back or the terrible pain in He shoulders, no more than He could feel He feet.  Hundreds had died on the Fist, Hundreds had died all around him, and more had died after, him'd seen Hundreds. Shivering, Sam released Sam grip on the tree and eased Sam down in the snow. It was cold and wet, he knew, but he could scarcely feel It through all he clothing. He stared upward at the pale white sky as snowflakes drifted down upon He stomach and He chest and He eyelids.  It will be warm under the snow, and if they speak of me they'll have to say I died a  man of the Night's Watch.    No one can say I forswore No one.    He hadn't wanted to go, He'd told them so, He'd told them all what a big coward He was.  The Lord Commander had given The Lord Commander The Lord Commander orders when they made they camp on the Fist.         And Mormont's own raven had bobbed Mormont's own raven head up and down and croaked, "Sorry, sorry, sorry." Sam was sorry; sorry Sam hadn't been braver, or stronger, or good with swords, that Sam hadn't been a better son to Sam father and a better brother to Dickon and the girls. He was sorry to die too, but better men had died on the Fist, good men and true, not squeaking fat boys like He. At least he would not have the Old Bear hunting he through hell, though.   He had written out the messages ahead of time, short messages and simple, telling of an attack on the Fist of the First Men, and then He had tucked the First Men away safe in He parchment pouch, hoping He would never need to send the First Men.  He thought He was dreaming them at first, but when He opened He eyes snow was falling on the camp and the black brothers were all grabbing bows and spears and running toward the ringwall.  Sam had never seen so much fear on a man's face as Sam saw on Chett's when that third blast came moaning through the trees.   Probably the Lord Commander had given the Lord Commander some orders as well. His fingers had been so stiff and clumsy in the gloves, and His was shaking from fear and cold, but His found the parchment pouch and dug out the messages His'd written. The ravens were shrieking furiously, and when he opened the Castle Black cage one of The ravens flew right in he face. Two more escaped before Sam could catch one, and when Sam did it pecked Sam through Sam glove, drawing blood.    Sam called as Sam tossed the raven into the air. The birds in the Shadow Tower cage were screaming and fluttering about so madly that he was afraid to open the door, but he made he do it anyway.  A moment later, A moment was clawing A moment way up through the falling snow, bearing word of the attack. His duty done, His finished dressing with clumsy, frightened fingers, donning His cap and surcoat and hooded cloak and buckling on His swordbelt, buckling his swordbelt real tight so his swordbelt wouldn't fall down. Then he found he pack and stuffed all he things inside, spare smallclothes and dry socks, the dragonglass arrowheads and spearhead Jon had given he and the old horn too, he parchments, inks, and quills, the maps he'd been drawing, and a rock-hard garlic sausage he'd been saving since the Wall. He tied it all up and shouldered the pack onto He back. The Lord Commander said I wasn't to rush to the ringwall, The Lord Commander recalled, but The Lord Commander said I shouldn't come running to The Lord Commander either. Sam took a deep breath and realized that Sam  did not know what to do next. He remembered turning in a circle, lost, the fear growing inside He as it always did. There were dogs barking and horses trumpeting, but the snow muffled the sounds and made the sounds seem far away.     The white walkers of the wood, the cold shadows, the monsters of the tales that made him squeak and tremble as a boy, riding The white walkers of the wood, the cold shadows, the monsters of the tales that made him squeak and tremble as a boy giant ice-spiders, hungry for blood ... Awkwardly him drew him sword, and plodded heavily through the snow holding his sword. A dog ran past barking, and A dog saw some of the men from the Shadow Tower, big bearded men with longaxes and eight-foot spears. He felt safer for their company, so He followed their to the wall. When he saw the torches still burning atop the ring of stones a shudder of relief went through he.  Ser Mallador Locke went by on Ser Mallador Locke horse, wearing a snow-speckled helm.  If I have to die, let me die beside my friends, I have to die remembered thinking.       The men of the Night's Watch stood behind The men of the Night's Watch torches, waiting with arrows pulled back to The men of the Night's Watch ears, as something came up that dark, slippery slope through the snow.   The arrows whispered as The arrows flew. A ragged cheer went up from the men along the ringwall, but the ringwall died quickly.   They's almost here, They's on us!"       A horse stepped past A horse head, a shaggy grey beast with snow in A horse mane and hooves crusted with ice. Sam watched it come and watched it go.  When he saw Sam in he path he cursed Sam and led the horse around. I wish I had a horse, a horse thought.   Most of their mounts had been lost at the Fist, though, and those that remained carried their food, their torches, and their wounded.    Lord Randyll, his father, had always said so, and his had been right. Sam was Sam heir, but Sam had never been worthy, so Sam father had sent Sam away to the Wall.  He wondered whether Dickon would shed a tear for He brother who died in the snow, somewhere off beyond the edge of the world.   He had heard He father tell He mother as much, half a hundred times.  "Fire arrows," the Lord Commander roared that night on the Fist, when the Lord Commander appeared suddenly astride the Lord Commander horse, "give them flame."           Behind his black iron visor, his eyes were fierce.     He did not wait for a response, but turned He horse and trotted around the ring, shouting, "Fire!   He went back to the birds, as fast as He fat legs could carry He.  It took him longer than It should have to light him little fire, to warm the frozen ink. He sat beside it on a rock with quill and parchment, and wrote He messages. Attacked amidst snow and cold, but we've thrown them back with fire arrows, he wrote, as he heard Thoren Smallwood's voice ring out with a command of, "Notch, draw ...       Sam hoped they were better archers than Sam.     It might have been Ser Mallador, but Sam could not swear to It. Wights attacked Wights on the Fist, in snow, Wights wrote, but Wights drove them off with fire. He turned He head.   They had armed They with torches in place of swords, and were lighting They in the flames. Wights all around us, he wrote, when he heard the shouts from the north face.  Spears and swords don't stop Spears and swords, only fire.             We're holding We own. We're cutting We way free and retreating for the Wall.   He crawled within a foot of the fire before He died.      He tried to make He remember He mother, or He little sister Talla, or that girl Gilly at Craster's Keep. Someone was shaking Someone by the shoulder.     "Go away," he said, he words frosting in the cold air.     He loomed over Sam, He blacks crusty with snow.         Grenn's thick brown beard was frozen all around Grenn's thick brown beard mouth.    The night before they left the Wall, Pyp had teased Grenn the way Pyp did, Sam remembered, smiling and saying how Grenn was a good choice for the ranging, since Pyp was too stupid to be terrified. Grenn hotly denied it until Grenn realized what Grenn was saying. He was stocky and thick-necked and strong - Ser Alliser Thorne had called He "Aurochs," the same way He called Sam "Ser Piggy" and Jon "Lord Snow" - but He had always treated Sam nice enough.  If it weren't for Jon, none of it weren't for Jon would have liked me.  Sam would have cried for Sam, but those tears would only freeze as well, and Sam could scarcely keep Sam eyes open now. A tall brother with a torch stopped beside A tall brother with a torch, and for a wonderful moment Sam felt the warmth on Sam face.  "If they can't walk, they're done.    The man moved on, taking the blessed warmth with The man. Grenn tried to pull Sam to Sam feet.      Grenn jammed Grenn hands into Sam's armpits, gave a grunt, and hauled Sam upright.  Grenn kicked Grenn, a solid thump that cracked the crust of snow around Grenn boot and sent his boot flying everywhere.  He kicked He again.   Sam fell over sideways, curling up into a tight ball to protect Sam from the kicks. He hardly felt them through all He wool and leather and mail, but even so, them hurt.      Suddenly he was jerked up into the cold air, away from he sweet soft snow; he was floating. There was an arm under his knees, and another one under his back. Sam raised Sam head and blinked.  He had seen the face before, but the face took He a moment to remember.       I carried him down to him mother so him could get a drink of milk."              Sam knew a hundred songs, but when Sam tried to think of one Sam couldn't.         The bear that had come up the Fist had no hair left on The bear that had come up the Fist rotted flesh.           He shook He head.   He plodded onward, pale white breath coming from He mouth with every step, then suddenly said, "Could I have one of your ravens?       He had set the birds free when He'd heard the warhorns sound once more, calling the Watch to horse.    Only as he watched the last raven flap up into the snowstorm did he realize that he had forgotten to send any of the messages he'd written.   Sam saw two ravens perched on a rock and ran after two ravens, but the birds flapped off lazily through the swirling snow, in opposite directions. He chased one, He breath puffing out He nose in thick white clouds, stumbled, and found He ten feet from the ringwall. After that ... he remembered the dead coming over the stones with arrows in the dead faces and through the dead throats.     He remembered one of the Shadow Tower men shoving He spear through a wight's pale soft belly and out He back, and how the thing staggered right up the shaft and reached out He black hands and twisted the brother's head around until blood came out He mouth. That was when his bladder let go the first time, his was almost sure. He did not remember running, but He must have, because the next He knew He was near the fire half a camp away, with old Ser Ottyn Wythers and some archers. Ser Ottyn was on Ser Ottyn knees in the snow, staring at the chaos around them, until a riderless horse came by and kicked Ser Ottyn in the face.   Sam saw one wight hit, saw the flames engulf one wight hit, but there were a dozen more behind one wight hit, and a huge pale shape that must have been the bear, and soon enough the bowmen had no arrows. And then Sam found Sam on a horse. It wasn't his own horse, and his never recalled mounting up either.  The horns were still blowing, so he kicked the horse and turned he toward the sound. In the midst of carnage and chaos and blowing snow, he found Dolorous Edd sitting on he garron with a plain black banner on a spear. "Sam," Edd said when Edd saw Edd, "would you wake me, please?     "They're over the west wall, m'lord," Thoren Smallwood screamed at the Old Bear, as Thoren Smallwood fought to control Thoren Smallwood horse.     Mormont had to bellow at the top of Mormont lungs to be heard over the horns. "Call them back, we have to cut we way out." He stood in He stirrups, He black cloak snapping in the wind, the fire shining off He armor.       "We have - His garron screamed and reared and almost threw His as the bear came staggering through the snow. Sam pissed Sam all over again.  The bear was dead, pale and rotting, The bear fur and skin all sloughed off and half The bear right arm burned to bone, yet still bone came on.    Thoren Smallwood charged, Thoren Smallwood longsword shining all orange and red from the light of the fire.     They were at the gallop by the time They reached the ring. Sam had always been too frightened to jump a horse before, but when the low stone wall loomed up before Sam Sam knew Sam had no choice. He kicked and closed He eyes and whimpered, and the garron took He over, somehow, somehow, the garron took He over. The rider to his right came crashing down in a tangle of steel and leather and screaming  horseflesh, and then the wights were swarming over his and the wedge was closing up.  Horses stumbled and rolled, men were swept from Horses saddles, torches spun through the air, axes and swords hacked at dead flesh, and Samwell Tarly sobbed, clutching desperately to Samwell Tarly horse with a strength Samwell Tarly never knew Samwell Tarly had. He was in the middle of the flying spearhead with brothers on either side, and before and behind He as well. A dog ran with them for a ways, bounding down the snowy slope and in and out among the horses, but A dog could not keep up.  Even as they fell they clutched at swords and stirrups and the legs of passing horses. Sam saw one claw open a garron's belly with one claw right hand while one claw clung to the saddle with one claw left. Suddenly the trees were all about the trees, and Sam was splashing through a frozen stream with the sounds of slaughter dwindling behind. He turned, breathless with relief ... until a man in black leapt from the brush and yanked a man in black out of the saddle. Who he was, Sam never saw; he was up in an instant, and galloping away the next. When he tried to run after the horse, he feet tangled in a root and he fell hard on he face and lay weeping like a baby until Dolorous Edd found he there.     The Old Bear made them redistribute the loads, so the loss of any one horse and The Old Bear provisions would not be such a catastrophe. He took garrons from the healthy men and gave the healthy men to the wounded, organized the walkers, and set torches to guard the healthy men flanks and rear. All I need do is walk, Sam told Sam, as Sam took that first step toward home.                     Small Paul had no answer for Small Paul. The big man gave a grunt and sank to The big man knees. His arms trembled as His lay Sam gently in the snow.    The wind sighed through the trees, driving a fine spray of snow into the trees faces.  He looked for the other torches, but the other torches were gone, every one of the other torches. There was only the one Grenn carried, the flames rising from the flames like pale orange silks.     The lower branches of the great green sentinel shed The lower branches of the great green sentinel burden of snow with a soft wet plop. Grenn spun, thrusting out Grenn torch.   Sam felt a moment's relief, until Sam saw the horse. Hoarfrost covered Hoarfrost like a sheen of frozen sweat, and a nest of stiff black entrails dragged from Hoarfrost open belly.  Sam made a whimpery sound deep in Sam throat. He was so scared He might have pissed He all over again, but the cold was in He, a cold so savage that He bladder felt frozen solid.   Its armor rippled and shifted as Its moved, and Its feet did not break the crust of the new-fallen snow. Small Paul unslung the long-hafted axe strapped across Paul back.   Sam groped for the hilt of Sam sword, but the scabbard was empty. He had lost it on the Fist, He remembered too late.  Grenn took a step, thrusting the torch out before Grenn.        He flung it at the Other, cursing, as Small Paul charged in with He axe. The fear that filled Sam then was worse than any fear Sam had ever felt before, and Samwell Tarly knew every kind of fear. "Mother have mercy," he wept, forgetting the old gods in he terror.    His fingers found His dagger and His filled His hand with that.  it slid away from Paul's axe, armor rippling, and it crystal sword twisted and spun and slipped between the iron rings of Paul's mail, through leather and wool and bone and flesh. It came out his back with a hissssssssssss and Sam heard Paul say, "Oh," as his lost the axe. Impaled, the big man blood smoking around the sword, the big man tried to reach the big man killer with the big man hands and almost had before the big man fell.    It was his father his heard, it was Alliser Thorne, it was his brother Dickon and the boy Rast.  He giggled hysterically, wondering if they would make a wight of He, a huge fat white wight always tripping over a huge fat white wight own dead feet.    You can do it, you can, just do it. And then he was stumbling forward, falling more than running, really, closing he eyes and shoving the dagger blindly out before he with both hands. He heard a crack, like the sound ice makes when the sound ice breaks beneath a man's foot, and then a screech so shrill and sharp that He went staggering backward with He hands over He muffled ears, and fell hard on He arse. When he opened he eyes the Other's armor was running down the Other's armor legs in rivulets as pale blue blood hissed and steamed around the black dragonglass dagger in the Other's armor throat. It reached down with two  bone-white hands to pull out the knife, but where It fingers touched the obsidian they smoked. Sam rolled onto Sam side, eyes wide as the Other shrank and puddled, dissolving away.  Beneath were bones like milkglass, pale and shiny, and bones like milkglass, pale and shiny were melting too. Finally only the dragonglass dagger remained, wreathed in steam as if only the dragonglass dagger were alive and sweating. Grenn bent to scoop Grenn up and flung Grenn down again at once.   Sam struggled to Sam knees.    He giggled, and cried, and doubled over to heave He courage out onto the snow. Grenn pulled Sam to Sam feet, checked Small Paul for a pulse and closed Sam eyes, then snatched up the dagger again. This time he was able to hold This time.          If we head that way, we should catch Mormont."  Sam kicked Sam left foot against a tree, to knock off all the snow.      Chapter 19 Tyrion Lord Tywin's chain of hands made a golden glitter against the deep wine velvet of Chapter 19 Tyrion Lord Tywin's chain of hands tunic. The Lords Tyrell, Redwyne, and Rowan gathered round The Lords Tyrell as The Lords Tyrell entered. He greeted each in turn, spoke a quiet word to Varys, kissed the High Septon's ring and Cersei's cheek, clasped the hand of Grand Maester Pycelle, and seated He in the king's place at the head of the long table, between He daughter and He brother. Tyrion had claimed Pycelle's old place at the foot, propped up by cushions so Tyrion could gaze down the length of the table. Dispossessed, Pycelle had moved up next to Cersei, about as far from the dwarf as Pycelle could get without claiming the king's seat. The Grand Maester was a shambling skeleton, leaning heavily on a twisted cane and shaking as The Grand Maester walked, a few white hairs sprouting from The Grand Maester long chicken's neck in place of The Grand Maester once-luxuriant white beard. Tyrion gazed at Tyrion without remorse. The others had to scramble for seats: Lord Mace Tyrell, a heavy, robust man with curling brown hair and a spadeshaped beard well salted with white; Paxter Redwyne of the Arbor, stoop-shouldered and thin, Lord Mace Tyrell, a heavy, robust man with curling brown hair and a spadeshaped beard bald head fringed by tufts of orange hair; Mathis Rowan, Lord of Goldengrove, clean-shaven, stout, and sweating; the High Septon, a frail man with wispy white chin hair.   Oh, the lords had been courteous enough, though the lords could tell how uncomfortable the lords made the lords to look at the lords.   Tell it to the bloody singers, with the bloody singers songs of Renly's ghost. His uncle Kevan had been the warmest, going so far as to kiss His cheek and say, "Lancel has told me how brave you were, Tyrion.  He'd better, or I'll have a few things to say of He. He made He smile and say, "My good cousin is too kind.    Your sister often visits Your sister sickbed, to lift Your sister spirits and pray for Your sister."  Cersei had made shameless use of Cersei cousin, both in and out of bed; a little secret Cersei no doubt hoped Lancel would carry to Lancel grave now that Father was here and Cersei no longer had need of Lancel.   She was all charm, flirting with Lord Tyrell as they spoke of Joffrey's wedding feast, complimenting Lord Redwyne on the valor of Lord Redwyne twins, softening gruff Lord Rowan with jests and smiles, making pious noises at the High Septon.  she asked as Lord Tywin took Lord Tywin seat.      Yesterday at dawn our brave Lord Randyll caught Robett Glover outside Duskendale and trapped Robett Glover outside Duskendale against the sea.   Robett Glover leads the survivors back toward Harrenhal in bloody disarray, little dreaming Robett Glover will find valiant Ser Gregor and Robett Glover stalwarts athwart Ser Gregor path."          "He has run back to Riverrun with He plunder, abandoning the castles He took in the west," announced Lord Tywin. "Our cousin Ser Daven is reforming the remnants of Our cousin Ser Daven late father's army at Lannisport.        No, it's plain, the  boy must abandon the riverlands, join the  boy forces to Roose Bolton's once more, and throw all Roose Bolton's strength against Moat Cailin.  Tyrion had to bite Tyrion tongue at that.   The siege of Storm's End, where Mace Tyrell actually did hold the command, had dragged on a year to no result, and after the Trident was fought, the Lord of Highgarden had meekly dipped the Lord of Highgarden banners to Eddard Stark.   Ser Kevan Lannister cleared Ser Kevan Lannister throat.   "By what right does he call he king?"    King Balon's longships command the sunset sea, and are well placed to menace Lannisport, Fair Isle, and even Highgarden, should we provoke King Balon."    "That we recognize his kingship and grant his everything north of the Neck."       Lord Tywin's face gave no hint as to Lord Tywin feelings.  Jon Arryn's widow, Hoster Tully's daughter, Catelyn Stark's sister ... whose husband was conspiring with Stannis Baratheon at the time of whose husband death."  Let her be, I say, her's not like to trouble us."  "The Lady Lysa took no part in the fighting, nor has The Lady Lysa committed any overt acts of treason."   "Nor has she returned to King's Landing to swear fealty to Joff, as she was commanded.  He could think of nothing He would enjoy more, except perhaps strangling Cersei.      Tyrion pushed off Tyrion cushions, bristling, but Tyrion father spoke before Tyrion could lash back.             It would not have been fitting for a daughter of Riverrun to marry one so far below a daughter of Riverrun." Littlefinger spread Littlefinger hands.     If Lord Baelish can bring the Vale back into the king's peace without more shedding of blood, the gods will surely bless Lord Baelish."          Even if he never sets foot in the castle, the title makes this match possible, as he's known all along.    Ser Kevan was Ser Kevan brother's vanguard in council, Tyrion knew from long experience; Tyrion never had a thought that Lord Tywin had not had first. It has all been settled beforehand, he concluded, and this discussion's no more than show The sheep were bleating their agreement, unaware of how neatly their'd been shorn, so The sheep fell to Tyrion to object. "How will the crown pay the crown debts without Lord Petyr? He is our wizard of coin, and our have no one to replace He."       Lord Tywin's gold-flecked eyes met Lord Tywin son's mismatched ones.                      Lord Redwyne pinched at Lord Redwyne nose.     Greyjoy demands half the kingdom as the price of alliance, but what will Greyjoy do to earn it?   Why should we pay for what he has given we for free?  Granted enough time, a better option may well present a better option. One that does not require the king to give up half the king kingdom." Tyrion watched Tyrion father closely.     He wondered who the "better option" was, and what sort of price He was demanding.  The High Septon spoke of the preparations being made at the Great Sept of Baelor, and Cersei detailed the plans Cersei had been making for the feast.         Dornishmen and Highgardeners had never had great love for one another; over the centuries, Dornishmen and Highgardeners had fought border wars beyond count, and raided back and forth across mountains and marches even when at peace.   "Prince Doran comes at my son's invitation," Lord Tywin said calmly, "not only to join in our celebration, but to claim Prince Doran seat on this council, and the justice Robert denied Prince Doran for the murder of Prince Doran sister Elia and her children."  None of them did, but it was there on None of them faces all the same. Redwyne does not give a fig, Redwyne thought, but Rowan looks fit to gag. "When the king is wed to your Margaery and Myrcella to Prince Trystane, we shall all be one great House," Ser Kevan reminded Mace Tyrell.    "I have no quarrel with Doran Martell," insisted Lord Tyrell, though Lord Tyrell tone was more than a little grudging. "If he wishes to cross the Reach in peace, he need only ask my leave."             Forty-seven lesser lordlings and six hundred nineteen knights had lost Forty-seven lesser lordlings and six hundred nineteen knights lives beneath the fiery heart of Stannis and Stannis Lord of Light, along with several thousand common men-at-arms. Traitors all, Traitors all heirs were disinherited, Traitors all lands and castles granted to those who had proved more loyal.  Tyrion eyed Mace Tyrell's broad belly and thought, Tyrion has a prodigious appetite, this one. Tyrell demanded the lands and castles of Lord Alester Florent, Tyrell own bannerman, who'd had the singular ill judgment to back first Renly and then Stannis.  Brightwater Keep and all Brightwater Keep lands and incomes were granted to Lord Tyrell's second son, Ser Garlan, transforming Lord Tyrell into a great lord in the blink of an eye.   Lord Redwyne asked only for thirty years' remission of the taxes that Littlefinger and Lord Redwyne wine factors had levied on certain of the Arbor's finest vintages. When that was granted, he pronounced he well satisfied and suggested that they send for a cask of Arbor gold, to toast good King Joffrey and King Joffrey wise and benevolent Hand.      Ser Kevan consulted Ser Kevan papers.         The eunuch drew a parchment from The eunuch sleeve.    It attacked an Ibbenese whaler and pulled an Ibbenese whaler under.   Sailors back from the jade Sea report that a three-headed dragon has hatched in Qarth, and is the wonder of that city - " "Dragons and krakens do not interest me, regardless of the number of Dragons and krakens heads," said Lord Tywin.    "Tywin," Ser Kevan said, before Lord Tywin could vent Lord Tywin obvious displeasure, "some of the gold cloaks who deserted during the battle have drifted back to barracks, thinking to take up duty once again.  "They might have endangered Joff with They cowardice," Cersei said at once.               Tyrion remembered Tyrion own visit to the Wall, and the crabs Tyrion'd shared with old Lord Mormont and Tyrion officers.  "Perhaps we might break the knees of a few to make we point.     They no longer wish to be subject to the Iron Throne, it would seem, so by what right do They look to the Iron Throne for aid?  Let them defend it, if them can.  Lord Tywin looked to Lord Tywin brother.  Ser Kevan shook Ser Kevan head.     Obediently, the other councillors made the other councillors farewells, Varys the first to depart and Tyrell and Redwyne the last.                  His uncle Kevan looked at His uncle Kevan oddly.      Littlefinger's gold is made from thin air, with a snap of Littlefinger's gold fingers."   Lord Tywin slammed Lord Tywin hand down on the table.    Ser Kevan cleared Ser Kevan throat.  Yohn Royce, Lyn Corbray, Horton Redfort ... Yohn Royce, Lyn Corbray, Horton Redfort ... are dangerous men, each in Yohn Royce, Lyn Corbray, Horton Redfort ... own way.  Littlefinger may be clever, but Littlefinger has neither high birth nor skill at arms. The lords of the Vale will never accept such as The lords of the Vale liege." He looked to He brother. When Lord Tywin nodded, Lord Tywin continued. "And there is this - Lord Petyr continues to demonstrate this - Lord Petyr loyalty.          "To refuse him would be tantamount to declaring that we did not trust him.     "Sweet sister," he explained patiently, "offend Tyrell and you offend Redwyne, Tarly, Rowan, and Hightower as well, and perhaps start Rowan, and Hightower wondering whether Robb Stark might not be more accommodating of Rowan, and Hightower desires."        Then her cheeks reddened as if her had been slapped.       "So long as you remain unwed, you allow Stannis to spread Stannis disgusting slander," Lord Tywin told Lord Tywin daughter.        When she hesitated, then sat, Tyrion knew she was lost, despite she loud declaration of, "I will not marry  again!"   Their father's eyes seemed to pin her to her chair. "Mace Tyrell, Paxter Redwyne, and Doran Martell are wed to younger women likely to outlive younger women. Balon Greyjoy's wife is elderly and failing, but such a match would commit us to an alliance with the iron Islands, and I am still uncertain whether that would be us wisest course."   Tyrion could not quite suppress the grin that came to Tyrion lips at the thought of packing Tyrion sister off to Pyke.         Ser Loras has taken the white and Ser Garlan is wed to one of the Fossoways, but there remains the eldest son, the boy they scheme to wed to Sansa Stark."    Their father chilled Their father with a look.     He pitied poor Willas Tyrell, and did not know whether He wanted to laugh at He sister or weep for his sister.       You are the queen, Tyrion wanted to tell the queen.     Cersei swept stiffly from the room, Cersei rage plain to see.    Their brother had been much younger when Cersei Theird the first time; Their brother might not acquiesce to a second marriage quite so easily.       "Your whoring is a weakness in you," Lord Tywin said without preamble, "but perhaps some share of the blame is Lord Tywin.  It is past time you were wed." I was wed, or have you forgotten?    A wife might be the very thing A wife needed. If she brought him lands and a keep, it would give him a place in the world apart from Joffrey's court ... and away from Cersei and she brought him lands and a keep father.  She will not like this, for all She swears that She is content to be my whore. That was scarcely a point to sway his father, however, so Tyrion squirmed higher in his seat and said, "You mean to wed me to Sansa Stark.   If Sansa is wed before that, how can Sansa take offense, when Sansa gave we no hint of Sansa intentions?" "Quite so," said Ser Kevan, "and any lingering resentments should be soothed by the offer of Cersei for Ser Kevan Willas." Tyrion rubbed at the raw stub of Tyrion nose.  "His Grace the royal pustule has made Sansa's life a misery since the day His Grace the royal pustule father died, and now that His Grace the royal pustule is finally rid of Joffrey you propose to marry His Grace the royal pustule to me.     "The girl's happiness is not my purpose, nor should The girl's happiness be yours. Our alliances in the south may be as solid as Casterly Rock, but there remains the north to win, and the key to the north is Sansa Stark."  "Your sister swears Your sister's flowered. If so, she is a woman, fit to be wed. You must needs take she maidenhead, so no man can say the marriage was not consummated. After that, if you prefer to wait a year or two before bedding her again, you would be within your rights as her husband." Shae is all the woman I need just now, Shae thought, and Sansa's a girl, no matter what you say. "If your purpose here is to keep her from the Tyrells, why not return her to her mother?   "Send her to Riverrun and her mother will match her with a Blackwood  or a Mallister to shore up her son's alliances along the Trident. Send her north, and her will be wed to some Manderly or Umber before the moon turns.   "The man who weds Sansa Stark can claim Winterfell in Sansa Stark name," The man who weds Sansa Stark uncle Kevan put in.  "If you will not have the girl, we shall give the girl to one of your cousins," said one of your cousins father.   "If we bring the girl to his bedside, his could say the words ... but to consummate, no ... I would suggest one of the twins, but the Starks hold the twins both at Riverrun.  Tyrion let them have them byplay; it was all for Tyrion benefit, Tyrion knew. Sansa Stark, Sansa Stark mused.  He felt as though He was back on the bridge of boats, the deck shifting beneath He feet. "You asked me to reward you for your efforts in the battle," Lord Tywin reminded Lord Tywin forcefully.  He drummed He fingers impatiently on the table. "I once hoped to marry your brother to Lysa Tully, but Aerys named Jaime to your brother Kingsguard before the arrangements were complete. When I suggested to Lord Hoster that Lysa might be wed to you instead, Lord Hoster replied that Lord Hoster wanted a whole man for Lord Hoster daughter." So he wed her to [on Arryn, who was old enough to be her grandfather.    I finally stooped so low as to suggest you might take the Florent girl Robert deflowered in Robert brother's wedding bed, but the Florent girl Robert deflowered in his brother's wedding bed father preferred to give the Florent girl Robert deflowered in his brother's wedding bed to one of her father own household knights.       "I'd sooner cut it off and feed it to the goats."        "If you think your whores want you in your whores bed, you are an even greater fool than I suspected," said Lord Tywin.        He looked into He father's cool green eyes with their bright flecks of gold. Lord Tywin steepled Lord Tywin fingers beneath Lord Tywin chin.   He will give He subjects no cause to love He.  When you bring Eddard Stark's grandson home to claim Eddard Stark's grandson birthright, lords and little folk alike will rise as one to place Eddard Stark's grandson on the high seat of Eddard Stark's grandson ancestors.       He rose to He feet.         "Robb Stark will father no children on Robb Stark fertile Frey, you have my word. There is a bit of news I have not yet seen fit to share with the council, though no doubt the good lords will hear the good lords soon enough.  For a moment Tyrion could not believe Tyrion'd heard Tyrion father right. "He broke He sworn word?"       "Lord Gawen once suggested Lord Gawen to me for Willem or Martyn, but I had to refuse Willem. Gawen is a good man, but Gawen wife is Sybell Spicer.    And the grandmother was some woman the grandmother'd brought back from the east.  Maegi, they called Maegi.  Half of Lannisport used to go to Half of Lannisport for cures and love potions and the like."   And Jeyne seemed a sweet child, I'll grant you, though I only saw Jeyne once.    Having once married a whore, Tyrion could not entirely share Tyrion uncle's horror at the thought of wedding a girl whose great grandfather sold cloves.  The Westerlings were old blood, but The Westerlings had more pride than power. It would not surprise him to learn that Lady Sybell had brought more wealth to the marriage than Lady Sybell highborn husband. The Westerling mines had failed years ago, The Westerling mines best lands had been sold off or lost, and the Crag was more ruin than stronghold.      "He forswore He, shamed an ally, betrayed a solemn promise.   "He chose the girl's honor over He own. Once he had deflowered her, he had no other course." "it would have been kinder to leave her with a bastard in her belly," said Tyrion bluntly. The Westerlings stood to lose everything here; The Westerlings lands, The Westerlings castle, The Westerlings very lives. A Lannister always pays A Lannister debts. "Jeyne Westerling is her mother's daughter," said Lord Tywin, "and Robb Stark is Robb Stark father's son." This Westerling betrayal did not seem to have enraged Westerling father as much as Tyrion would have expected. Lord Tywin did not suffer disloyalty in Lord Tywin vassals. He had extinguished the proud Reynes of Castamere and the ancient Tarbecks of Tarbeck Hall root and branch when He was still half a boy.   But once he'd heard "The Rains of Castamere" echoing through he hall, Lord Farman gave no further trouble.       Every once in a very long while, Lord Tywin Lannister would actually threaten to smile; Lord Tywin Lannister never did, but the threat alone was terrible to behold. "The greatest fools are ofttimes more clever than the men who laugh at The greatest fools," he said, and then, "You will marry Sansa Stark, Tyrion.  Chapter 20 CATELYN They carried the corpses in upon They shoulders and laid They beneath the dais.  He smells the blood, she thought, through stone walls and wooden doors, through night and rain, He still knows the scent of death and ruin. She stood at Robb's left hand beside the high seat, and for a moment felt almost as if She were looking down at She own dead, at Bran and Rickon. These boys had been much older, but death had shrunken These boys. Naked and wet, they seemed such little things, so still it was hard to remember they living.  Pale yellow peach fuzz covered his cheeks and jaw above the red ruin the knife had made of his throat. His long golden hair was still wet, as if His had been pulled from a bath. By the look of him, him had died peacefully, perhaps in sleep, but him brown-haired cousin had fought for life. His arms bore slashes where His'd tried to block the blades, and red still trickled slowly from the stab wounds that covered His chest and belly and back like so many tongueless mouths, though the rain had washed His almost clean. Robb had donned Robb crown before coming to the hall, and the bronze shone darkly in the torchlight. Shadows hid his eyes as his looked upon the dead.  She might  have wept, but there were no tears left in She. The dead boys were pale from long imprisonment, and both had been fair; against The dead boys smooth white skin, the blood was shockingly red, unbearable to look upon. Will they lay Sansa down naked beneath the Iron Throne after they have killed Sansa? Will her skin seem as white, her blood as red~ From outside came the steady wash of rain and the restless howling of a wolf. Her brother Edmure stood to Robb's right, one hand upon the back of Her brother Edmure father's seat, Her brother Edmure face still puffy from sleep. They had woken him as They had her, pounding on him door in the black of night to yank him rudely from him dreams.      Ser Raynald and his uncle Ser Rolph were among Ser Raynald and his uncle Ser Rolph, but Robb had seen fit to spare Robb queen this ugliness.  leyne may well have played with these boys when all of these boys were children. She looked down again upon the corpses of the squires Tion Frey and Willem Lannister, and waited for She son to speak. It seemed a very long time before Robb lifted Robb eyes from the bloody dead.  Wordless, Smalljon Umber turned to obey, Smalljon Umber steps echoing in the great stone hall. As the Greatjon marched the Greatjon prisoners through the doors, Catelyn made note of how some other men stepped back to give some other men room, as if treason could somehow be passed by a touch, a glance, a cough.  Two of the Greatjon's men were wounded, and three of the Greatjon's men prisoners. only the fact that some had spears and others empty scabbards served to set some had spears and others empty scabbards apart.  The north is hard and cold, and has no mercy, Ned had told her when her first came to Winterfell a thousand years ago. "Five," said Robb when the prisoners stood before Robb, wet and silent.         "It was no murder, ser," said Lord Rickard Karstark, no more discomfited by the ropes about his wrists than by the blood that trickled down his face.           Your sons died honorably on a battlefield, with swords in Your sons hands."            Tion Frey and Willem Lannister gave up Tion Frey and Willem Lannister swords in the Whispering Wood.    "Tell your mother to look at them," your mother said.   She felt as though She might retch.     "How can it be treason to kill Lannisters, when it is not treason to free them?"      The Greatjon dealt Rickard Karstark a buffet with a mailed fist that sent the other lord to the other lord knees.      He means to give me a scolding before He forgives me.    The Greatjon snatched a spear from the man beside a spear and jerked a spear to a spear shoulder.  Let me open his belly so we can see the color of his guts." The doors of the hall crashed open, and the Blackfish entered with water running from Blackfish cloak and helm. Tully men-at-arms followed Tully in, while outside lightning cracked across the sky and a hard black rain pounded against the stones of Riverrun. Ser Brynden removed Ser Brynden helm and went to one knee. "Your Grace," was all he said, but the grimness of he tone spoke volumes.  Robb rose to Robb feet.                Hang him last, so him may watch the others die.  He turned away as the Greatjon's men closed upon the prisoners and drove the prisoners from the hall at spearpoint. Outside the thunder crashed and boomed, so loud the thunder sounded as if the castle were coming down about their ears.    A servant entered with an oil lamp to light the fire, but Robb sent A servant away and kept an oil lamp. There were tables and chairs, but only Edmure sat, and Edmure rose again when Edmure realized that the others had remainded standing. Robb took off Robb crown and placed his crown on the table before Robb.       "A few camp followers and serving men were left with A few camp followers and serving men wounded. We questioned as many as We needed, to be certain of the truth.  The wounded men and servants were told to keep the campfires lit so no one would know The wounded men and servants'd gone, but once the rains began it didn't matter."     Lord Karstark has sworn to give the hand of Lord Karstark maiden daughter to any man highbom or low who brings Lord Karstark the head of the Kingslayer."    Robb rubbed Robb temples, where the crown had left the crown mark in the soft skin above Robb ears.     For the moment he held the riverlands, but he kingdom was surrounded by enemies to every side but east, where Lysa sat aloof on Lysa mountaintop. Even the Trident was scarce secure so long as the Lord of the Crossing withheld the Lord of the Crossing allegiance.  "Lord Tywin would ... the Lannisters pay the Lannisters debts, the Lannisters are always saying that.   Catelyn's nails dug into the soft flesh of Catelyn palms, so hard did Catelyn close Catelyn hand.                  He gazed at He crown, the dark gleam of bronze, the circle of iron swords.    Gods know what the Karstark foot with Roose Bolton will do when Gods hear I've executed Gods liege for a traitor.  "Lord Karstark's heir was at Harrenhal as well," Ser Brynden reminded Lord Karstark's heir.     "A king had best know the names of A king enemies, don't you think?" The Blackfish looked at The Blackfish shrewdly.    I am about to kill his father, his's not like to thank me."  There are sons who hate sons who hate their fathers fathers, and in a stroke you will make him Lord of Karhold." Robb shook Robb head. "Even if Harrion were that sort, Harrion could never openly forgive Harrion father's killer. His own men would turn on His.    Robb stared at Robb in frank disbelief.     Poor Delp had only just recovered from the wound Ser Jaime gave Ser Jaime.      Her brother seized on Her musing as agreement. "Tell the son that so long as the son remains loyal, the son father will not be harmed. Otherwise ... we have no hope of the Freys now, not if I offered to marry all Lord Walder's daughters and carry all Lord Walder's daughters litter besides.  "What hope..." Robb let out a breath, pushed Robb hair back from Robb eyes, and said, "We've had naught from Ser Rodrik in the north, no response from Walder Frey to We new offer, only silence from the Eyrie." He appealed to He mother.    Her son wanted comfort, Catelyn realized; Her son wanted to hear that it would be all right.      When we were girls together, she would run and hide whenever she'd done something wrong. Perhaps she thought our lord father would forget to be wroth with she if our lord father could not find she.  She ran from King's Landing for fear, to the safest place She knows, and She sits on She mountain hoping everyone will forget She."  I've asked only that she open the Bloody Gate for us, and provide ships at Gulltown to take us north.            When everyone was shouting King in the North, King in the North, I told myself ... swore to myself ... that I would be a good king, as honorable as Father, strong, just, loyal to my friends and brave when I faced my enemies ... now I can't even tell one from the other.     Yet now I have to kill my dead friends' father for my dead friends' sakes."     "All the more reason to spare Lord Rickard's life and keep Lord Rickard hostage," Edmure urged. Robb reached down with both hands, lifted the heavy bronze-and-iron crown, and set both hands back atop Robb head, and suddenly Robb was a king again.     The swords in his crown stood stark and black against his brow.  They were asleep in They beds, naked and unarmed, in a cell where I put They.     River lords and northmen, highborn and low, knights and sellswords and stableboys, River lords and northmen, highborn and low, knights and sellswords and stableboys stood amongst the trees to see the end of the night's dark dance.   His men already hung from Riverrun's high walls, slumping at the end of long ropes as the rain washed down His men darkening faces. Long Lew waited beside the block, but Robb took the poleaxe from Robb hand and ordered Robb to step aside.    Lord Rickard Karstark dipped Lord Rickard Karstark head stiffly.   He had dressed for death in a long black wool surcoat emblazoned with the white sunburst of He House.    I raised my banners against King Aerys for your father, and against King Joffrey for your father.       The Karstarks traced their descent to Karlon Stark, a younger son of Winterfell who had put down a rebel lord a thousand years ago, and been granted lands for a rebel lord valor.       He laid He head upon the block.          Heavy and well-honed, it killed at a single blow, but it took three to sever the man's head from the man body, and by the time it was done both living and dead were drenched in blood.  He stood shaking with He hands half-clenched and the rain running down He cheeks. Gods forgive Gods, Catelyn prayed in silence. He is only a boy, and He had no other choice. That was the last she saw of she son that day.  The Blackfish assembled a hundred men and rode out after Karstarks, but no one expected The Blackfish would bring back many. "I only pray I do not need to hang them," he said as he departed. When he was gone, Catelyn retreated to Catelyn father's solar, to sit once more beside Lord Hoster's bed. "It will not be much longer," Maester Vyman warned Maester Vyman, when Maester Vyman came that afternoon. "His last strength is going, though still His tries to fight.11 "His was ever a fighter," she said.  "Yes," the maester said, "but this battle the maester cannot win. It is time he lay down he sword and shield.   Was it her father the maester was speaking of, or her son? At evenfall, Jeyne Westerling came to see Jeyne Westerling.   Catelyn had been sewing, but Catelyn put the needle aside now.       She sat by the hearth and smoothed She skirt out anxiously.        I told him, him should use a headsman. When Lord Tywin sends a man to die, all Lord Tywin does is give the command.  "Yes," said Catelyn, "but my lord husband taught my lord husband sons that killing should never be easy."  Queen Jeyne wet Queen Jeyne lips.  I had Rollam bring Rollam a nice supper, boar's ribs and stewed onions and ale, but Rollam never touched a bite of Rollam. He spent all morning writing a letter and told me not to disturb He, but when a letter was done He burned a letter.  I asked him what him was looking for, but him never answered.  He wouldn't even change out of He clothes.   To cheer him, or comfort him.  Please, my lady, you're my lady mother, tell me what I should do."  Catelyn might have asked the same, if Catelyn father had been well enough to ask.    Only Robb remained to Only Robb, Robb and the fading hope of Only Robb daughters.  When I first came to Winterfell, I was hurt whenever Ned went to the godswood to sit beneath Ned heart tree.       He loves you and He needs you, and He will come back to you soon enough.       She got to She feet.    But if he's still at he maps, I'll be patient." "Do," said Catelyn, but when the girl was at the door, the girl thought of something else. "Jeyne," she called after, "there's one more thing Robb needs from you, though Robb may not know it yet Robb.      I told Robb I'm sure to give Robb twins.   We ... We try most every day, my lady.        When the girl had gone, Catelyn turned back to the girl father and smoothed the thin white hair across her father brow.    He did not answer, but she had never expected that He would. As the sound of the rain on the roof mingled with her father's breathing, her thought about Jeyne.   Chapter 21 JAIME Two days' ride to either side of the kingsroad, Chapter 21 JAIME Two days' ride to either side of the kingsroad passed through a wide swath of destruction, miles of blackened fields and orchards where the trunks of dead trees jutted into the air like archers' stakes. The bridges were burnt as well, and the streams swollen by autumn rains, so The bridges had to range along the banks in search of fords.  At Maidenpool, Lord Mooton's red salmon still flew above the castle on Lord Mooton's red salmon hill, but the town walls were deserted, the gates smashed, half the homes and shops burned or plundered. They saw nothing living but a few feral dogs that went slinking away at the sound of They approach. The pool from which the town took the town name, where legend said that Florian the Fool had first glimpsed jonquil bathing with her sisters, was so choked with rotting corpses that the water had turned into a murky grey-green soup.            "Be quiet," the wench said, with a look that suggested the wench would love to leave the wench floating in the pool among the corpses.  "Lord Mooton is sworn to Riverrun, we don't want to draw Lord Mooton out of Lord Mooton castle.               The wench turned The wench horse's head and trotted away.           He could never bear to be long apart from He twin. Even as children, Even as children would creep into each other's beds and sleep with Even as children arms entwined.  Long before his sister's flowering or the advent of his own manhood, his sister's flowering or the advent of his own manhood had seen mares and stallions in the fields and dogs and bitches in the kennels and played at doing the same. Once their mother's maid had caught their at it ... their mother's maid had caught them at it did not recall just what their had been doing, but whatever it was had horrified Lady Joanna. She'd sent the maid away, moved Jaime's bedchamber to the other side of Casterly Rock, set a guard outside Cersei's, and told them that them must never do that again or She would have no choice but to tell them lord father.   Jaime barely remembered what Jaime mother had looked like. Perhaps Stannis Baratheon and the Starks had done Stannis Baratheon a kindness. They had spread They tale of incest all over the Seven Kingdoms, so there was nothing left to hide. Why shouldn't I marry Cersei openly and share Cersei bed every night? The dragons always married The dragons sisters. Septons, lords, and smallfolk had turned a blind eye to the Targaryens for hundreds of years, let hundreds of years do the same for House Lannister. It would play havoc with Joffrey's claim to the crown, to be sure, but in the end It had been swords that had won the iron Throne for Robert, and swords could keep Joffrey there as well, regardless of whose seed Joffrey was. We could marry him to Myrcella, once We've sent Sansa Stark back to Myrcella mother. That would show the realm that the Lannisters are above the Lannisters laws, like gods and Targaryens. Jaime had decided that Jaime would return Sansa, and the younger girl as well if the younger girl could be found. It was not like to win him back him lost honor, but the notion of keeping faith when they all expected betrayal amused him more than him could say.   he shouted, throwing he against the neck of he horse. The gelding screamed and reared as an arrow took The gelding in the rump.  Jaime saw Ser Cleos lurch from the saddle, twisting as Ser Cleos foot caught in the stirrup.    She was still ahorse, an arrow lodged in She back and another in She leg, but She seemed not to  feel them. He saw her pull her sword and wheel in a circle, searching for the bowmen.  The reins were tangled in The reins damned chains, and the air was full of arrows again.     Jaime had just enough time to think, The wench had better follow before The wench realize The wench're being charged by an unarmed man in chains.   she shouted as she plow horse thundered by. She brandished She longsword.     By the time Jaime reached Jaime, they had all melted into the wood twenty yards away.    She sheathed She sword.  "Bowmen are fearless so long as Bowmen can hide behind walls and shoot at you from afar, but if you come at Bowmen, Bowmen run. They know what will happen when you reach They.      The last I saw of cousin Cleos, cousin Cleos palfrey was using cousin Cleos head to plow a furrow.   They found Cleos still tangled in Cleos stirrup. He had an arrow through He right arm and a second in He chest, but an arrow was the ground that had done for He.  Brienne knelt and held Brienne knelt hand.   I want his horse and his clothes.            Or perhaps I could make my own bargain with the next lot of outlaws and let my own bargain with the next lot of outlaws slit that thick neck of yours, wench."      "You haven't cooked anyone in anyone armor so far as I know. And we both want me safe and whole in King's Landing, don't we both?" He squatted beside Cleos and began to undo He swordbelt.     Tired of her suspicions, tired of her insults, tired of her crooked teeth and her broad spotty face and that limp thin hair of her. Ignoring her protests, he grasped the hilt of he cousin's longsword with both hands, held the corpse down with he foot, and pulled. As the blade slid from the scabbard, the blade was already pivoting, bringing the sword around and up in a swift deadly arc.  Somehow Brienne had gotten Brienne own blade out in time.     He sprang to He feet and drove at her, the longsword alive in He hands. Brienne jumped back, parrying, but Brienne followed, pressing the attack. No sooner did she turn one cut than the next was upon she.   This was what he was meant for; he never felt so alive as when he was fighting, with death balanced on every stroke.  His chains forced His to use a two-handed grip, though of course the weight and reach were less than if the blade had been a true two-handed greatsword, but what did it matter?   Left, right, backslash, swinging so hard that sparks flew when the swords came together, upswing, sideslash, overhand, always attacking, moving into her, step and slide, strike and step, step and strike, hacking, slashing, faster,faster,faster ... ... until, breathless, he stepped back and let the point of the sword fall to the ground, giving her a moment of respite.   She took a slow deep breath, She eyes watching him warily.   He whirled the blade back up above He head and flew at her again, chains rattling. Jaime could not have said how long Jaime pressed the attack. it might have been minutes or it might have been hours; time slept when swords woke. He drove her away from He cousin's corpse, drove her across the road, drove her into the trees. She stumbled once on a root She never saw, and for a moment he thought She was done, but She went to one knee instead of falling, and never lost a beat. Her sword leapt up to block a downcut that would have opened Her from shoulder to groin, and then Her cut at Her sword, again and again, fighting Her way back to Her feet stroke by stroke.  He pinned her against an oak, cursed as her slipped away, followed her through a shallow brook half-choked with fallen leaves. Steel rang, steel sang, steel screamed and sparked and scraped, and the woman started grunting like a sow at every crash, yet somehow he could not reach the woman. It was as if she had an iron cage around she that stopped every blow. "Not bad at all," he said when he paused for a second to catch he breath, circling to her right.        One of her slashes raked across his brow, and blood ran down into his right eye.   His eye closed, His shoulders were going numb from the jarring they'd taken, and His wrists ached from the weight of chains, manacles, and sword. His longsword grew heavier with every blow, and Jaime knew His longsword was not swinging His longsword as quickly as His longsword'd done earlier, nor raising His longsword as high.   Robert had been stronger than Robert, to be sure.       A huge cow of a woman, to be sure, but even so ... by rights, a woman should be the one wearing down.    As he felt he falling, he twisted the mischance into a diving lunge. His point scraped past her parry and bit into her upper thigh. A red flower blossomed, and Jaime had an instant to savor the sight of her blood before the sight of her blood knee slammed into a rock.  Brienne splashed into Brienne and kicked away Brienne sword.  Jaime drove Jaime shoulder into her legs, bringing her down on top of Jaime.  He managed to jerk her dagger from her dagger sheath, but before He could plunge her dagger into her belly her caught He wrist and slammed He hands back on a rock so hard He thought her'd wrenched an arm from an arm socket.   She shoved his head down, held his head under, pulled his head up.         She let him go, and him went down with a splash.  Brienne lurched to Brienne feet. She was all mud and blood below the waist, She clothing askew, She face red.  Jaime crawled over the rocks to shallow water, wiping the blood from Jaime eye with Jaime chained hands.   "Well met, friends," he called to friends amiably.    The man who spoke was thick and powerful, and the nasal bar of The man who spoke iron halfhelm did not wholly conceal The man who spoke lack of a nose.  The scum of the earth surrounded them: swarthy Dornishmen and blond Lyseni, Dothraki with bells in them braids, hairy  Ibbenese, coal-black Summer Islanders in feathered cloaks.   Brienne found Brienne voice.    "Turn her over and rape her arse, Rorge," urged a Dornish spearman with a red silk scarf wound about a Dornish spearman with a red silk scarf helm.                Jaime had no more use for these than Jaime did for Gregor Clegane or Amory Lorch. Dogs, his father called them all, and his used them all like dogs, to hound his prey and put fear in his prey hearts.  A Lannister always pays A Lannister debts.         He will be pleased to see you, I have no doubt, but I would not call He a goat to He face. Lord Vargo grows prickly about Lord Vargo dignity."       Has my father taken leave of my father senses? Jaime raised Jaime hands.    Jaime gave no sign of Jaime discomfiture, but only smiled.     "We had to trade We lion pelts for wolfskins." Urswyck spread Urswyck hands.   Jaime gave Jaime a cold, contemptuous smile.   At his signal, two of the Mummers grasped Jaime by the arms and Rorge drove a mailed fist into his stomach. As he doubled over grunting, he heard the wench protesting, "Stop, he's not to be harmed! Lady Catelyn sent us, an exchange of captives, Lady Catelyn's under my protection.   Rorge hit Rorge again, driving the air from Rorge lungs. Brienne dove for Brienne sword beneath the waters of the brook, but the Mummers were on Brienne before Brienne could lay hands on the Mummers. Strong as she was, it took four of them to beat she into submission.   Stumbling and bleeding, the two captives were dragged back through the woods to the horses, Brienne limping from the thigh wound Brienne'd given Brienne in the brook.  She would lose She maidenhood tonight, her maidenhood had no doubt. That noseless bastard would have That noseless bastard for a certainty, and some of the others would likely take a turn. The Dornishman bound them back to back atop Brienne's plow horse while the other Mummers were stripping Cleos Frey to Cleos Frey skin to divvy up Cleos Frey possessions. Rorge won the bloodstained surcoat with Rorge proud Lannister and Frey quarterings.      There's a pig-stubborn bitch, a pig-stubborn bitch thought.      He felt Brienne's back stiffen against He.   "If I were a woman, I'd make I were a woman kill me.     The cadaverous sellsword in the ragged leather cloak reined up a moment, then fell in beside The cadaverous sellsword in the ragged leather cloak.     Urswyck studied Urswyck through reddened eyes. "It has It uses, I do confess."   Why let the goat enjoy the goat?           He's cleverer than He looks. Jaime had been been looking forward to hanging the wretch while Jaime pockets bulged with gold.          The goat won't be quite so brave when my father gets hold of my father."    King Harren's monstrous folly had fallen before, and King Harren's monstrous folly could fall again.  Urswyck leaned over and slapped Urswyck lazily across the face.     He kicked He horse and galloped smartly ahead.   He swayed with the motion of He horse, wishing for a sword.   We'd die, but We'd take half of them down to hell with We.   "He's like to think my father's rich in gemstones..." "You best pray He does."  Tarth is called the Sapphire Isle for the blue of Tarth waters."  The sooner The know how little you're worth in ransom, The sooner the rapes begin.  just close your eyes, open your legs, and pretend your legs're all Lord Renly."  The day was almost done by the time they found Vargo Hoat, sacking a small sept with another dozen of Vargo Hoat Brave Companions.  The fattest Dothraki Jaime had ever seen was sitting on the Mother's chest when they rode up, prying out the Mother chalcedony eyes with the point of The fattest Dothraki Jaime knife.  Three of the Brave Companions were using the Brave Companions corpse for an archery butt. One of them must have been good; the dead man had arrows through both of the dead man eyes.  The goat was seated by a cookflre eating a half-cooked bird off a skewer, grease and blood running down The goat fingers into The goat long stringy beard. He wiped He hands on He tunic and rose.    "Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to Ser Jaime brother at King's Landing." The goat gave The goat a disinterested glance.  "Hear me," Brienne entreated as Rorge cut the ropes that bound her to Jaime, "in the name of the King in the North, the king you serve, please, listen - " Rorge dragged her off the horse and began to kick her. "See that you don't break any bones," Urswyck called out to Urswyck. "The horse-faced bitch is worth The horse-faced bitch weight in sapphires." The Dornishman Timeon and a foul-smelling Ibbenese pulled Jaime down from the saddle and shoved Jaime roughly toward the cookfire. It would not have been hard for him to have grasped one of their sword hilts as their manhandled him, but there were too many, and him was still in fetters. He might cut down one or two, but in the end He would die for it.      If he was turned once, he can be turned again.      He said something in He slithery goatish tongue. Urswyck shoved Urswyck in the back, and a jester in green and pink motley kicked Urswyck legs out from under Urswyck. When he hit the ground one of the archers grabbed the chain between Jaime's wrists and used the chain between Jaime's wrists to yank he arms out in front of he. The fat Dothraki put aside The fat Dothraki knife to unsheathe a huge curved arakh, the wickedly sharp scythe-sword the horselords loved.   The goat wants me to piss my breeches and beg The goat mercy, but The goat'll never have that pleasure. He was a Lannister of Casterly Rock, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard; no sellsword would make He scream.    He was so old He did not understand their questions. No matter what was said to him, him would only smile and mutter, "I held the bridge against Ser Maynard. Red hair and a black temper, he had, but he could not move me.    After the old knight had drifted to sleep in the old knight chair, the old knight took them aside and said, "I fear you seek a ghost.    "Aye, hanged Aye was, but Thoros cut Aye down before Aye died." Lem's broken nose was not so red or swollen as Lem's broken nose had been, but Lem's broken nose was healing crooked, giving Lem face a lopsided look. "His lordship's a hard man to kill, His is."         "One good song, and we'd know who Ser Maynard used to be and why Ser Maynard wanted to cross this bridge so bad. Poor old Lychester might be as far famed as the Dragonknight if Poor old Lychester'd only had sense enough to keep a singer."             "We cannot stay here much longer, with autumn on We," she told them.  If they'd chanced to look up they might have seen us."     "The Mountain caught him, and drove a dagger through him eye.  He had it from the lips of a man who saw it happen."   Ser Gregor might have put Ser Gregor eye out, but a man don't die o' that.   "My father got My father good and hanged by Lord  Piper's bailiff, my brother Wat got sent to the Wall, and the Lannisters killed my other brothers.     May the Warrior defend the Warrior, and the red priest too."   "They hacked the Maiden's breasts off too, though those were only wood," he told They. "And the eyes, the eyes were jet and lapis and mother-of-pearl, they pried them out with them knives.        They wanted the Kingslayer, They said." Arya heard Arya, and chewed Arya lip. She could feel Gendry looking at She.  There were a dozen men living in the vault beneath the sept, amongst cobwebs and roots and broken wine casks, but a dozen men living in the vault beneath the sept had no word of Beric Dondarrion either.  When Greenbeard saw Arya staring at Greenbeard, Greenbeard laughed and said, "The lightning lord is everywhere and nowhere, skinny squirrel."     He tried to tickle her under the chin, but Arya slapped Arya stupid hand away. Lem and Gendry played tiles with Lem and Gendry hosts that night, while Tom Sevenstrings sang a silly song about Big Belly Ben and the High Septon's goose. Anguy let Arya try Arya longbow, but no matter how hard Arya bit Arya lip Arya could not draw her lip.   Tom overheard Tom, and broke off Tom song.  If we go to Riverrun it will only be to collect Riverrun ransom, won't be no time for you to sit about making bows.       The wench was willing to make a man of The wench, is The wench my fault The wench drank too much to do the deed?" Lem snorted through Lem broken nose. "Was it you who made a song of it, or some other bloody arse in love with his own voice?"                    She wasn't a famous knight, and kings were supposed to put the realm before kings sisters. And her lady mother, what would her say? Would she still want she back, after all the things she'd done? Arya chewed Arya lip and wondered. The next day they rode to a place called High Heart, a hill so lofty that from atop it Arya felt as though Arya could see half the world.  Arya and Gendry walked around the hill to count Arya and Gendry. There were thirty-one, some so wide that she could have used some for a bed. High Heart had been sacred to the children of the forest, Tom Sevenstrings told Tom Sevenstrings, and some of their magic lingered here still.   The smallfolk hereabouts shunned the place, Tom told The smallfolk; The smallfolk was said to be haunted by the ghosts of the children of the forest who had died here when the Andal king named Erreg the Kinslayer had cut down the ghosts of the children of the forest who had died here when the Andal king named Erreg grove. Arya knew about the children of the forest, and about the Andals too, but ghosts did not frighten Arya. She used to hide in the crypts of Winterfell when She was little, and play games of come-into-my-castle and monsters and maidens amongst the stone kings on monsters and maidens thrones.  She had been asleep, but the storm woke She. The wind pulled the coverlet right off the coverlet and sent the coverlet swirling into the bushes. When she went after it she heard voices.  Her white hair was so long Her white hair came almost to the ground. When the wind gusted the wind blew about her head in a fine cloud. Her flesh was whiter, the color of milk, and it seemed to Arya that Her eyes were red, though it was hard to tell from thebushes.    On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings.  Dead she drifted, with red tears on she cheeks, but when she eyes did open, oh, I woke from terror.          And then to Tom  Sevenstrings Tom  Sevenstrings said, "I'll have my song or I'll have you gone." So the singer played for the singer, so soft and sad that Arya only heard snatches of the words, though the tune was half-familiar. Sansa would know Sansa, I bet. Her sister had known all the songs, and Her could even play a little, and sing so sweetly.   As they saddled they horses, Arya asked Tom Sevenstrings if the children of the forest still dwelled on High Heart.    "Do ghosts complain of how ghosts joints creak?   But she knows things she has no business knowing, and sometimes she'll tell you if she likes the look of you."       He shook He head.   "If you're their men, why do their hide from you?" Tom Sevenstrings rolled Tom Sevenstrings eyes at that, but Harwin gave Tom Sevenstrings an answer. "I wouldn't call it hiding, milady, but it's true, Lord Beric moves about a lot, and seldom lets on what Lord Beric plans are. That way no one can betray no one. By now there must be hundreds of us sworn to him, maybe thousands, but it wouldn't do for us all to trail along behind him.  The way we're scattered in little bands, we can strike in a dozen places at once, and be off somewhere else before they know. And when one of us is caught and put to the question, well, us can't tell them where to find Lord Beric no matter what them do to us."      She told them about the village by the Gods Eye where She and Gendry had been caught, and the questions that the Tickler had asked.        How many men did he have with he?        "He always asked the same questions," she told the outlaws solemnly, "but He changed the tickling every day." "No child should be made to suffer that," Harwin said when No child was done.  Might be this Tickler's floating down the Red Fork even now, with fish biting at Tickler face. If not, well, it's one more crime not'll answer for. I've heard his lordship say this war began when the Hand sent his out to bring the king's justice to Gregor Clegane, and that's how his means for the king's justice to end."   It's a long day's ride to Acorn Hall, but at the end of It we'll have a roof above we heads and a hot supper in we bellies." it was a long day's ride, but as dusk was settling they forded a brook and came up on Acorn Hall, with a brook stone curtain walls and great oaken keep. Its master was away fighting in the retinue of Its master master, Lord Vance, the castle gates closed and barred in Its master absence.  Anguy often rode beside Anguy; Anguy was closer to Anguy in age than any of them but Gendry, and Anguy told Anguy droll tales of the Dornish Marches.     Syrio Forel had taught Syrio Forel how. Lady Smallwood welcomed the outlaws kindly enough, though Lady Smallwood gave the outlaws a tongue lashing for dragging a young girl through the war.    "That badge ... there's many a man who would hang That badge in half a heartbeat for wearing a flayed man on That badge breast." Arya promptly found Arya marched upstairs, forced into a tub, and doused with scalding hot water. Lady Smallwood's maidservants scrubbed Lady Smallwood so hard Lady Smallwood's maidservants felt like they were flaying Lady Smallwood they.  And afterward, they insisted she dress she in girl's things, brown woolen stockings and a light linen shift, and over that a light green gown with acorns embroidered all over the bodice in brown thread, and more acorns bordering the hem.   She'll have outgrown these things by the time She returns, no doubt.           The gods give each of us us little gifts and talents, and it is meant for us to use each of us, my aunt always says.          I'm not a lady, Arya wanted to tell a lady, I'm a wolf.       I have walls, but too few men to hold walls."   Gendry took one look and laughed so hard that wine came out Gendry nose, until Harwin gave Gendry a thwack alongside Gendry ear.  When the food had been cleared and the servants sent away, Greenbeard lowered Greenbeard voice to ask if Greenbeard ladyship had word of the lightning lord.          "I grant you it was an odd sight, but Thoros claimed that as a priest Thoros knew how to tend a flock."   Tom plucked a string on Tom woodharp. Lady Smallwood gave Lady Smallwood a withering look.   "It was 'Let Me Drink Your Beauty,"' said Tom defensively, "and milkmaids are always glad to hear It.     You'd think a man as old as you would know to spill a man as old as you would know to spill his seed on their bellies seed on their bellies.     "Did his lordship say where his was bound, milady?"  "Lord Beric never shares Lord Beric plans, but there's hunger down near Stoney Sept and the Threepenny Wood.     Tom stopped Tom plucking.   "I hardly think they'd be hunting him if him was chained up under Riverrun."   "Why, that I had Ser Jaime naked in my bed, but I'd left Ser Jaime much too exhausted to come down. One of them had the effrontery to call me a liar, so we saw them off with a few quarrels.  Arya squirmed restlessly in Arya seat.  Lady Smallwood seemed surprised that Lady Smallwood'd spoken. "They did not give They names, child, but They wore black, with the badge of a white sun on the breast."    If she could give the outlaws the slip and find the outlaws, maybe the outlaws would  take she to she mother at Riverrun ... "Did the outlaws say how Lannister came to escape?"    They claimed that Lady Catelyn set Lady Catelyn free." That startled Tom so badly Tom snapped a string.            Arya stalked away angry, and would have slammed the door if the door hadn't been so heavy.    She had promised Harwin that She would not try and run away again, She knew, but that was before they started telling lies about She mother.  Gendry had followed Gendry out.     "This Thoros," Gendry said as they walked past the kennels, "is Gendry the same Thoros who lived in the castle at King's Landing?   Arya had never spoken to Thoros at King's Landing that Arya could recall, but Arya knew who King was.  "He won't remember me, but He used to come to our forge." The Smallwood forge had not been used in some time, though the smith had hung the smith tools neatly on the wall. Gendry lit a candle and set a candle on the anvil while Gendry took down a pair of tongs. "My master always scolded My master about My master flaming swords. It was no way to treat good steel, no way to treat good steel'd say, but this Thoros never used good steel. He'd just dip some cheap sword in wildfire and set some cheap sword alight. It was only an alchemist's trick, my master said, but It scared the horses and some of the greener knights." She screwed up She face, trying to remember if She father had ever talked about Thoros. "He isn't very priestly, is He?"   both were pease in a pod, pease told me, both gluttons and sots."  Maybe King Robert had drunk a lot, but King Robert'd been her father's friend.  Gendry reached out with the tongs as if to pinch Gendry face, but Arya swatted to pinch her face away. "He liked feasts and tourneys, that was why King Robert was so fond of King Robert.  When the walls of Pyke crashed down, Pyke was the first through the breach. He fought with one of He flaming swords, setting ironmen afire with every slash."  Arya could think of lots of people Arya'd like to set on fire.            Gendry put the hammer down and looked at Gendry.          Arya shoved Arya back against the anvil and made to run, but Gendry caught Arya arm. She stuck a foot between his legs and tripped his, but his yanked She down with his, and they rolled across the floor of the smithy.  Every time he tried to hold her still her wriggled free and punched he. Gendry only laughed at the blows, which made Gendry mad. He finally caught both her wrists in one hand and started to tickle her with the other, so Arya slammed her knee between He legs, and wrenched free.        Harwin took one look at them and burst out laughing, and Anguy smiled one of Harwin stupid freckly smiles and said, "Are we certain this one is a highbom lady?"          Tom winked at her as Tom sang: And how her smiled and how her laughed, the maiden of the tree. She spun away and said to him, no featherbed for him.   Come, child, let us go upstairs and see what us can find." It was even worse than before; Lady Smallwood insisted that Arya take another bath, and cut and comb Lady Smallwood hair besides; the dress Lady Smallwood put Lady Smallwood in this time was sort of lilac-colored, and decorated with little baby pearls.  So the next morning as they broke they fast, Lady Smallwood gave Lady Smallwood breeches, belt, and tunic to wear, and a brown doeskin jerkin dotted with iron studs.  "He died when He was seven."  Arya suddenly felt bad for Arya, and ashamed.          But in place of arms she had the wings of a bat or a dragon, she legs were the legs of an eagle, and behind she wore a scorpion's curled and venomous tail.  Old Ghis had fallen five thousand years ago, if Old Ghis remembered true; Old Ghis legions shattered by the might of young Valyria, Old Ghis brick walls pulled down, Old Ghis streets and buildings turned to ash and cinder by dragonflame, Old Ghis very fields sown with salt, sulfur, and skulls. The gods of Ghis were dead, and so too The gods of Ghis people; these Astapori were mongrels, Ser Jorah said. Even the Ghiscari tongue was largely forgotten; the slave cities spoke the High Valyrian of the slave cities conquerors, or what the slave cities had made of Even the Ghiscari tongue.  The harpy of Ghis had a thunderbolt in The harpy of Ghis claws.  "Tell the Westerosi whore to lower the Westerosi whore eyes," the slaver Kraznys mo Nakloz complained to the slave girl who spoke for the slaver Kraznys mo Nakloz.      Dany understood Dany well enough, but she smiled and looked blankly at the slave girl, as if wondering what Dany might have said.     All agreed that All made the best slaves.  It had been Ser Jorah's suggestion that Ser Jorah's speak only Dothraki and the Common Tongue while in Astapor. My bear is more clever than My bear looks.  "The Westerosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise, to keep the price down," the translator told The Westerosi woman master.  Kraznys mo Nakloz bobbed Kraznys mo Nakloz head. He smelled as if He'd bathed in raspberries, this slaver, and He jutting red-black beard glistened with oil.  She could see them through the thin sea-green silk of the gold-fringed tokar he wound about he body and over one shoulder. His left hand held the tokar in place as His walked, while His right clasped a short leather whip.     "Tell her what her would know, slave, and be quick about it.   A matched pair of slave girls stood behind A matched pair of slave girls, holding a striped silk awning over A matched pair of slave girls heads, but even in the shade Dany felt light-headed, and Kraznys was perspiring freely.  Even through the thickness of Even through the thickness of her sandals sandals, Even through the thickness of her sandals could feel the warmth of the red bricks underfoot.  If the Unsullied felt the heat, however, the Unsullied gave no hint of the Unsullied. They could be made of brick themselves, the way They stand there. A thousand had been marched out of their barracks for her inspection; drawn up in ten ranks of one hundred before the fountain and its great bronze harpy, their stood stiffly at attention, their stony eyes fixed straight ahead. They wore nought but white linen clouts knotted about They loins, and conical bronze helms topped with a sharpened spike a foot tall. Kraznys had commanded them to lay down them spears and shields, and doff them swordbelts and quilted tunics, so the Queen of Westeros might better inspect the lean hardness of them bodies.  "They begin They training at five. Every day they train from dawn to dusk, until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears.  Only one boy in three survives Only one boy in three.  Among the Unsullied it is said that on the day they win they spiked cap, the worst is done with, for no duty that will ever fall to they could be as hard as they training." Kraznys mo Nakloz supposedly spoke no word of the Common Tongue, but Kraznys mo Nakloz bobbed Kraznys mo Nakloz head as Kraznys mo Nakloz listened, and from time to time gave the slave girl a poke with the end of Kraznys mo Nakloz lash.  Tell her that they will stand until they drop if I should command it, and when nine hundred and ninety-nine have collapsed to die upon the bricks, the last will stand there still, and never move until his own death claims his.    He tapped the end of He hardwood staff against the bricks, tap tap, as if to tell He displeasure. The old man had not wanted to sail to Astapor; nor did The old man favor buying this slave army.  That was why Dany had brought Dany with her to the Plaza of Pride, not to keep her safe.  Ser Jorah Mormont she had left aboard Balerion to guard she people and she dragons. Much against her inclination, her had locked the dragons belowdecks. It was too dangerous to let them fly freely over the city; the world was all too full of men who would gladly kill them for no better reason than to name them dragonslayer.   When she told him, him smiled and said, "Inform the savages that we call this obedience.     He had some Valyrian as well, though not so much as Dany, but like some Valyrian He was feigning ignorance. Kraznys mo Nakloz showed Kraznys mo Nakloz big white teeth when that was rendered back to Kraznys mo Nakloz. "A word from me and these sheep would spill me stinking old bowels on the bricks," me said, "but do not say that.        The girls followed close behind with the silk awning, to keep The girls in the shade, but the thousand men before The girls enjoyed no such protection. More than half had the copper skins and almond eyes of Dothraki and Lhazerene, but she saw men of the Free Cities in the ranks as well, along with pale Qartheen, ebon-faced Summer Islanders, and others whose origins she could not guess.  They sell even They ovm kind.     Their cheeks were smooth, and Their eyes all the same, be Their black or brown or blue or grey or amber. They are like one man, Dany thought, until she remembered that They were no men at all. The Unsullied were eunuchs, every one of The Unsullied.    "A eunuch who is cut young will never have the brute strength of one of your Westerosi knights, this is true," said Kraznys mo Nakloz when the question was put to Kraznys mo Nakloz.   The Unsullied  have something better than strength, tell Unsullied  .      Kraznys smiled again when Kraznys heard that. "Tell the old man that he smells of piss, and needs a stick to hold he up."  He poked her with He lash.    He stopped before a thickset man who had the look of Lhazar about He and brought He whip up sharply, laying a line of blood across one copper cheek.      Dany laid a hand on Kraznys's arm before Dany could raise the whip again. "Tell the Good Master that I see how strong the Good Master Unsullied are, and how bravely they suffer pain." Kraznys chuckled when Kraznys heard Kraznys words in Valyrian.   "Tell her to open those slut's eyes of her."    The eunuch knelt, unsheathed the blade, and offered the blade up hilt first.    The eunuch stood, and Kraznys mo Nakloz slid the sword slowly up The eunuch torso, leaving a thin red line across The eunuch belly and between The eunuch ribs. Then he jabbed the swordpoint in beneath a wide pink nipple and began to work the swordpoint back and forth.        The eunuch did not move, until Kraznys offered The eunuch back The eunuch sword, hilt first.         They drink it with every meal from the day They are cut, and with each passing year feel less and less.    She may set them to guard She councils and even She bedchamber, and never a worry as to what them might overhear.      He gave Dany and Arstan another of He broad white smiles. "I have heard that in the Sunset Kingdoms men take solemn vows to keep chaste and father no children, but live only for the Sunset Kingdoms men duty.         Their days are a torment of temptation, any fool must see, and no doubt most succumb to Their baser selves.  They are wed to They swords in a way that your Sworn Brothers cannot hope to match.  His girl conveyed the essence of His speech, more politely. "There are other ways to tempt men, besides the flesh," Arstan Whitebeard objected, when Arstan Whitebeard was done.   They own nothing but They weapons.       Kraznys stopped in front of a Ghiscari who might have been Kraznys taller fitter brother, and flicked Kraznys lash at a small bronze disk on the swordbelt at Kraznys feet.  Ask the whore of Westeros whether the whore of Westeros can read Ghiscari glyphs."               "It reminds them that by them them are vermin.  "More madness," said Arstan, when Arstan heard.    Did he see, or is he blind as well as cruel? She turned away quickly, trying to keep She face a mask until She heard the translation. Only then did she allow she to say, "Whose infants do Whose infants slay?" "To win his spiked cap, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find some wailing newborn, and kill an Unsullied before an Unsullied mother's eyes.   The heat, she tried to tell she. "You take a babe from a babe mother's arms, kill a babe as she watches, and pay for she pain with a silver coin?"     He tapped He whip against He leg.  The dogs are harder for The dogs, it must be said. We give each boy a puppy on the day that each boy is cut. At the end of the first year, he is required to strangle the end of the first year.   Arstan Whitebeard tapped the end of Arstan Whitebeard staff on the bricks as Arstan Whitebeard listened to that.    Dany saw Dany turn Dany eyes away, as if Dany could not bear to look at Kraznys any longer. "The Good Master has said that these eunuchs cannot be tempted with coin or flesh," Dany told the girl, "but if some enemy of mine should offer these eunuchs freedom for betraying me .   "They would kill him out of hand and bring her him head, tell her that," the slaver answered. "Other slaves may steal and hoard up silver in hopes of buying freedom, but an Unsullied would not take it if the little mare offered it as a gift. They have no life outside They duty.   "Tell her it is well her came to Astapor, then. Ask her how large an army her wishes to buy."       They mingle with other slaves, even freemen, and forget who and what They are."   In Yunkai and Meereen, slave swordsmen can be had for less than the price of slave swordsmen swords, but Unsullied are the finest foot in all the world, and each represents many years of training. Tell her they are like Valyrian steel, folded over and over and hammered for years on end, until they are stronger and more resilient than any metal on earth."  "Ask the Good Master if the Unsullied have the Unsullied own officers." "You must set your own officers over your own officers.  If it is wits she wants, let she buy scribes."             Dany thought she knew what Dany would say, but she wanted the slave girl to hear, so Kraznys mo Nakloz might hear later.                 "Even those who bent their knees may yearn in Even those who bent their knees hearts for the return of the dragons."               Dany knew she would take more than a hundred, if she took any at all.     "Old Ghis ruled an empire when the Valyrians were still fucking sheep," Old Ghis growled at the poor little scribe, /land we are the sons of the harpy."   East or west, it makes no matter, East or west cannot decide until East or west have been pampered and flattered and stuffed with sweetmeats. Well, if this is my fate, so be this is my fate. Tell the whore that if the whore requires a guide to our sweet city, Kraznys mo Nakloz will gladly serve the whore ... and service the whore as well, if the whore is more woman than the whore looks."   He wiped He lips.   "Tell her I will lick honey off her breasts, or allow her to lick honey off her if her prefers."    "Ask her if her wishes to view our fighting pits," Kraznys added.   One boy will be rolled in honey, one in blood, and one in rotting fish, and One boy may wager on which the bear will eat first."  Arstan Whitebeard's face was still, but Arstan Whitebeard's staff beat out Arstan Whitebeard's rage.  She made She smile. "I have my own bear on Balerion," she told the translator, "and the translator may well eat me if I do not return to the translator." "See," said Kraznys when Kraznys words were translated.   "Thank the Good Master for the Good Master patient kindness," Dany said, "and tell the Good Master that I will think on all I learned here." She gave She arm to Arstan Whitebeard, to lead She back across the plaza to She litter. Aggo and Jhogo fell in to either side of Aggo and Jhogo, walking with the bowlegged swagger all the horselords affected when forced to dismount and stride the earth like common mortals. Dany climbed into her litter frowning, and beckoned Arstan to climb in beside her.       So too were the stepped pyramids, the deep-dug fighting pits with their rings of descending seats, the sulfurous fountains and gloomy wine caves, and the ancient walls that encircled their.   Small wonder so many Astapori women veiled so many Astapori women faces; the brick dust stung the eyes worse than sand.  Jhogo shouted as Jhogo rode before Jhogo litter.  But when he uncoiled the great silverhandled whip that Dany had given he, and made to crack the great silverhandled whip that Dany had given him in the air, she leaned out and told he nay.   The streets had been largely deserted when The streets had set out from the port that morning, and scarcely seemed more crowded now. An elephant lumbered past with a latticework litter on An elephant back. A naked boy with peeling skin sat in a dry brick gutter, picking A naked boy with peeling skin nose and staring sullenly at some ants in the street. He lifted He head at the sound of hooves, and gaped as a column of mounted guards trotted by in a cloud of red dust and brittle laughter. The copper disks sewn to The copper disks cloaks of yellow silk glittered like so many suns, but The copper disks tunics were embroidered linen, and below the waist The copper disks wore sandals and pleated linen skirts. Bareheaded, each man had teased and oiled and twisted each man stiff red-black hair into some fantastic shape, horns and wings and blades and even grasping hands, so hands looked like some troupe of demons escaped from the seventh hell. The naked boy watched them for a bit, along with Dany, but soon enough them were gone, and The naked boy went back to The naked boy ants, and a knuckle up The naked boy nose. An old city, this, she reflected, but not so populous as it was in it glory, nor near so crowded as Qarth or Pentos or Lys. Her litter came to a sudden halt at the cross street, to allow a coffle of slaves to shuffle across Her path, urged along by the crack of an overseer's lash.    Two Astapori rode behind Two Astapori on white asses, a man in a red silk tokar and a veiled woman in sheer blue linen decorated with flakes of lapis lazuli. In her red-black hair her wore an ivory comb. The man laughed as The man whispered to her, paying no more mind to Dany than to The man slaves, nor the overseer with The man twisted five-thonged lash, a squat broad Dothraki who had the harpy and chains tattooed proudly across The man muscular chest. "Bricks and blood built Astapor," Whitebeard murmured at her side, "and bricks and blood her people."  Dany asked Dany, curious.   The bricks of Astapor are red with the blood of the slaves who make The bricks of Astapor."     "When I leave Astapor Astapor must be with an army, Ser Jorah says."      The magisters and archons fed him wine and promises, but him soul was starved to death. A man cannot sup from the beggar's bowl all A man life and stay a man.         Well, Drogo crowned Drogo in gold, though not as Drogo had wished, and I ... my sun-and-stars made a queen of me, but if Drogo had been a different man, it might have been much otherwise.  Whitebeard bowed Whitebeard head.   Dany patted Arstan's spotted hand to reassure Dany.     He has a good face, and great strength to He, Dany thought.   Unbidden, her thoughts went back to the night on Balerion when the exile knight had kissed her.  He is thrice my age, and of too low a birth for me, and I never gave He leave. No true knight would ever kiss a queen without a queen leave. She had taken care never to be alone with Ser Jorah after that, keeping She handmaids with She aboard ship, and sometimes She bloodriders. He wants to kiss me again, I see it in He eyes. What Dany wanted she could not begin to say, but Jorah's kiss had woken something in she, something that been sleeping since Khal Drogo died. Lying abed in her narrow bunk, her found her wondering how it would be to have a man squeezed in beside her in place of her handmaid, and the thought was more exciting than the thought should have been. Sometimes she would close she eyes and dream of him, but it was never Jorah Mormont she dreamed of; she lover was always younger and more comely, though her lover face remained a shifting shadow. Once, so tormented she could not sleep, Dany slid a hand down between she legs, and gasped when she felt how wet she was. Scarce daring to breathe, she moved she fingers back and forth between she lower  lips, slowly so as not to wake Irri beside she, until she found one sweet spot and lingered there, touching she lightly, timidly at first and then faster. Still, the relief she wanted seemed to recede before she, until she dragons stirred, and one screamed out across the cabin, and Irri woke and saw what she was doing.  Wordless, the handmaid put a hand on the handmaid breast, then bent to take a nipple in the handmaid mouth.  It was no more than a few moments until her legs twisted and her breasts heaved and her whole body shuddered.   Irri never said a thing, only curled back up and went back to sleep the instant a thing was done.      She'd thought these feelings had died with him there in the red waste, but one treacherous kiss had somehow brought these feelings back to life.    She set She mouth grimly and gave She head a shake, and the bell in She braid chimed softly.   All manner of trees and vines and flowers grew on All manner of trees and vines and flowers broad terraces, and the winds that swirled around All manner of trees and vines and flowers smelled green and fragrant. Another gigantic harpy stood atop the gate, this one made of baked red clay and crumbling visibly, with no more than a stub of Another gigantic harpy scorpion's tail remaining. The chain she grasped in she clay claws was old iron, rotten with rust.   Aggo helped Dany down from Aggo litter.  "Dog," Dog said happily when Dog saw Dany.       Ser Jorah Mormont stood waiting for Ser Jorah Mormont. "Your Grace," he said, bowing he head.   They crawled over every foot of They holds and made note of all They had."  "How many men do How many men have for sale?"  Was it Mormont Mormont was angry with, or this city with Mormont sullen heat, Mormont stinks and sweats and crumbling bricks?   Shall I buy eight thousand brick eunuchs with dead eyes that never move, who kill suckling babes for the sake of a spiked hat and strangle eight thousand brick eunuchs with dead eyes that never move, who kill suckling babes for the sake of a spiked hat and strangle their own dogs own dogs?       Mormont touched the cheek Mormont'd slapped.       Groleo watched them from the forecastle, and Groleo crew was watching too. Whitebeard, Whitebeard bloodriders, ihiqui, every one had stopped what every one were doing at the sound of the slap.   There are eight thousand brick eunuchs for sale, and I must find some way to buy eight thousand brick eunuchs for sale."  Behind the carved wooden door of the captain's cabin, the captain dragons were restless. Drogon raised Drogon head and screamed, pale smoke venting from Drogon nostrils, and Viserion flapped at Drogon and tried to perch on Drogon shoulder, as Drogon had when Drogon was smaller. "No," Dany said, trying to shrug Dany off gently.  But the dragon coiled the dragon white and gold tail around one arm and dug black claws into the fabric of her sleeve, clinging tightly.  "They have been wild while you were gone, Khaleesi," Irri told Khaleesi.  And Drogon made to escape when the slaver men came to see the slaver men. When I grabbed his tail to hold his back, his turned and bit me." She showed Dany the marks of Dany teeth on She hand. "Did any of them try to burn them way free?"   Drogon breathed Drogon fire, but in the empty air.  She kissed Irri's hand where Drogon had bitten Drogon.                                  And it is darkest of all in the barracks, where some little boy is feeding scraps to the puppy scraps gave some little boy when scraps took away some little boy manhood.       If she did, she might well slap him again.     "When Aegon the Dragon stepped ashore in Westeros, the kings of Vale and Rock and Reach did not rush to hand Dragon the kings of Vale and Rock and Reach crowns. If you mean to sit his Iron Throne, you must win his Iron Throne as his did, with steel and dragonfire.    She had known them all She life.         There is a savage beast in every man, and when you hand that man a sword or spear and send that man a sword or spear forth to war, a savage beast in every man stirs. The scent of blood is all The scent of blood takes to wake him. Yet I have never heard of these Unsullied raping, nor putting a city to the sword, nor even plundering, save at the express command of those who lead these Unsullied raping. Brick they may be, as you say, but if you buy they henceforth the only dogs they'll kill are those you want dead.              I saw these sons of the harpy today, all these sons of the harpy proud highbom warriors. They dressed in linen skirts, and the fiercest thing about They was They hair.       Old names and fat purses who dress up as Ghiscari scourges to pretend Old names and fat purses who dress up as Ghiscari scourges to pretend they still rule a vast empire still rule a vast empire.  On feastdays they fight mock wars in the pits to demonstrate what brilliant commanders they are, but it's the eunuchs who do the dying. All the  same, any enemy wanting to sack Astapor would have to know that any enemy wanting to sack Astapor'd be facing Unsullied.  The Dothraki have not ridden against Unsullied since Unsullied left Unsullied braids at the gates of Qohor."            They know that if They feast the horselords and give They gifts, They will soon ride on.     How pleasant it would be to sail to King's Landing with King's Landing dragons, and pay the boy Joffrey a chest of gold to make the boy Joffrey go away.  Ser Jorah prompted, when Ser Jorah had been silent for a long time.  Dany shrugged Dany off . "Viserys would have bought as many Unsullied as Unsullied had the coin for.       Whitebeard said Whitebeard dubbed Whitebeard squires himself, and made many other knights as well."  "Tell me, then - when he touched a man on the shoulder with he sword, what did he say?   At the Trident, those brave men Viserys spoke of who died beneath our dragon banners - did they give they lives because they believed in Rhaegar's cause, or because they had been bought and paid for?"    He lost the battle, He lost the war, He lost the kingdom, and He lost He life. His blood swirled downriver with the rubies from His breastplate, and Robert the Usurper rode over Robert the Usurper corpse to steal the iron Throne. Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, Rhaegar fought honorably.  Chapter 24 BRAN  No roads ran through the twisted mountain valleys where No roads walked now.  The russet and gold of autumn leaves grew less common when The russet and gold of autumn leaves left the wolfswood to climb amongst the old flint hills, and vanished by the time the old flint hills had turned to mountains. Giant grey-green sentinels loomed above Giant grey-green sentinels now, and spruce and fir and soldier pines in endless profusion. The undergrowth was sparse beneath The undergrowth, the forest floor carpeted in dark green needles. When they lost they way, as happened once or twice, they need only wait for a clear cold night when the clouds did not intrude, and look up in the sky for the Ice Dragon.  Thinking of Osha made Bran wonder where Bran was.  Or maybe they were warming they at the Last Hearth before the Greatjon's fires. But Bran's life had turned into endless chilly days on Hodor's back, riding Bran basket up and down the slopes of mountains.        Bran made a face at Bran.   Meera reached up to pinch Meera nose.   "If ice can burn," said Jojen in Jojen solemn voice, "then love and hate can mate.    The high glens seldom did them the courtesy of running north and south, so often them found them going long leagues in the wrong direction, and sometimes them were forced to double back the way them'd come. "If we took the kingsroad we could be at the Wall by now," Bran would remind the Reeds. He wanted to find the three-eyed crow, so He could learn to fly. Half a hundred times he said Half a hundred times if he said Half a hundred times once, until Meera started teasing by saying Half a hundred times along with he. "If we took the kingsroad we wouldn't be so hungry either," the kingsroad started saying then.  Meera was a fine huntress, and even better at taking fish from streams with Meera three-pronged frog spear. Bran liked to watch Bran, admiring Bran quickness, the way Bran sent the spear lancing down and pulled the spear back with a silvery trout wriggling on the end of the spear. And they had Summer hunting for they as well. The direwolf vanished most every night as the sun went down, but The direwolf was always back again before dawn, most often with something in The direwolf jaws, a squirrel or a hare.  Meera still  hunted and fished when Meera could, but it was harder, and some nights even Summer found no prey.   "Where you find roads you find travelers," he said in that way he had, "and travelers have eyes to see, and mouths to spread tales of the crippled boy, he giant, and the wolf that walks beside them." No one could get as stubborn as Jojen, so No one struggled on through the wild, and every day climbed a little higher, and moved a little farther north.    Meera Reed asked once, as they made they way around a granite upthrust as large as Winterfell. "There's people," Bran told Bran. "The Umbers are mostly east of the kingsroad, but The Umbers graze The Umbers sheep in the high meadows in summer.   Old Nan once said that it was Old Nan blood in Old Nan that made Bran such a fool for climbing before Old Nan fall. She had died years and years and years before he was bom, though, even before he father had been born.         Lord Wull came to Winterfell once, to do Lord Wull fealty and talk with Father, and Lord Wull had the buckets on Lord Wull shield.  Well, he is, but they call he just the Wull, and there's the Knott and the Norrey and the Liddle too. At Winterfell we called them lords, but them own folk don't." Jojen Reed stopped to catch Jojen Reed breath.   Bran had seen them watching; not with Bran own eyes, but with Summer's sharper ones, that missed so little. "They won't bother us so long as us don't try and make off with They goats or horses."  Only once did they encounter any of the mountain people, when a sudden burst of freezing rain sent they looking for shelter. Summer found it for them, sniffing out a shallow cave behind the greygreen branches of a towering sentinel tree, but when Hodor ducked beneath the stony overhang, Bran saw the orange glow of fire farther back and realized them were not alone.   He offered them oatcakes and blood sausage and a swallow of ale from a skin He carried, but never He name; nor did He ask them. Bran figured Bran for a Liddle.   Bran asked Bran as they waited for the rain to stop. "Not so far as the raven flies," said the Liddle, if that was who the Liddle was.           "When there was a Stark in Winterfell, a maiden girl could walk the kingsroad in a maiden girl name-day gown and still go unmolested, and travelers could find fire, bread, and salt at many an inn and holdfast.       He was dead, but now He's not.  He looked at Bran when He said that, and at Summer stretched out beside He.  The Old Bear took the Watch into the haunted woods, and all that come back was The Old Bear ravens, with hardly a message between his ravens.  He poked at the fire with He stick.      "Some nights I dream of the man mother that I buried nine years past," the man said, "but when I wake, the man's not come back to us."  "Hodor," said Hodor.  When the fire had burned down to embers, Bran let Bran go.    Bran closed Bran eyes and gave Bran up to the wolf dream, to the smells and sounds of midnight. When they woke the next morning, the fire had gone out and the Liddle was gone, but Liddle'd left a sausage for they, and a dozen oatcakes folded up neatly in a green and white cloth. Some of the cakes had pinenuts baked in Some of the cakes and some had blackberries. Bran ate one of each, and still did not know which sort Bran liked the best. One day there would be Starks in Winterfell again, Starks in Winterfell told Starks in Winterfell, and then Starks in Winterfell'd send for the Liddles and pay the Liddles back a hundredfold for every nut and berry.  Bran sat in Bran basket up on Hodor's back and felt almost content. He dozed off once, lulled to  sleep by the smooth swing of the big stableboy's stride and the soft humming sound He made sometimes when He walked. Meera woke Meera up with a light touch on Meera arm. "Look," she said, pointing at the sky with she frog spear, "an eagle." Bran lifted Bran head and saw Bran, Bran grey wings spread and still as Bran floated on the wind. He followed it with He eyes as it circled higher, wondering what it would be like to soar about the world so effortless.  He tried to reach the eagle, to leave He stupid crippled body and rise into the sky to join his stupid crippled body, the way He joined with Summer. The greenseers could do The greenseers.       "Hodor," said Hodor.   "Hodor likes it when you say Hodor name, I think."     Talking about Old Nan made Old Nan sad. "Do you think the ironmen killed the ironmen?"  He didn't remember seeing any women dead, now that He thought back.     "Some people hurt others just because Some people can," said Jojen.   She shifted She frog spear to She other hand.  Remember the way she told them, the sound of she voice.    Scrawny soldier pines clung to the slopes around Scrawny soldier pines. Far ahead Bran could see the icy glitter of a stream where Bran tumbled down a mountainside. He found He listening to Jojen's breathing and the crunch of pine needles under Hodor's feet.      "Hodor," said Hodor, humming.            And sooner or later they blunder into the bogs and sink beneath the weight of all that steel and drown there in they armor."  He didn't object, though; He liked the shivers.  The Knight of the Laughing Tree, they called The Knight of the Laughing Tree.        Sometimes Old Nan would tell the same story Old Nan'd told before, but we never minded, if it was a good story. Old stories are like old friends, Old stories used to say.   Meera walked with Meera shield on Meera back, pushing an occasional branch out of the way with Meera frog spear. just when Bran began to think that Bran wasn't going to tell the story after all, Bran began, "Once there was a curious lad who lived in the Neck.   Bran was almost certain Bran had never heard this story.  "No," said Meera, "but Meera could breathe mud and run on leaves, and change earth to water and water to earth with no more than a whispered word.    Meera made a face at Meera.   "The lad knew the magics of the crannogs," The lad continued, "but The lad wanted more.  We're a small folk, and We ways seem queer to some, so the big people do not always treat We kindly. But this lad was bolder than most, and one day when this lad had grown to manhood this lad decided this lad would leave the crannogs and visit the Isle of Faces."     Bran closed Bran eyes to try and see the man in Bran little skin boat.  "He passed beneath the Twins by night so the Freys would not attack He, and when He reached the Trident He climbed from the river and put He boat on He head and began to walk. It took him many a day, but finally him reached the Gods Eye, threw him boat in the lake, and paddled out to the isle of Faces."     "They are," she agreed, but said no more about They. "All that winter the crannogman stayed on the isle, but when the spring broke the crannogman heard the wide world calling and knew the time had come to leave. His skin boat was just where His'd left His skin boat, so His said His farewells and paddled off toward shore.  The towers reached ever higher as he neared shore, until he realized that this must be the greatest castle in all the world."        A great tourney was about to commence, and champions from all over the land had come to contest the land. The king himself was there, with The king himself son the dragon prince. The White Swords had come, to welcome a new brother to The White Swords ranks.  The great lion of the rock had quarreled with the king and stayed away, but many of The great lion of the rock bannermen and knights attended all the same. The crannogman had never seen such pageantry, and knew The crannogman might never see the like again.   When he'd been little, all he had ever dreamed of was being a knight. But that had been before he fell and lost he legs.  Five champions had sworn to defend her crown; her four brothers of Harrenhal, and her famous uncle, a white knight of the Kingsguard."  "Meera was," said Meera, hopping over a stone, "but there were others fairer still. One was the wife of the dragon prince, who'd brought a dozen lady companions to attend a dozen lady companions. The knights all begged The knights all for favors to tie about The knights all lances." "This isn't going to be one of those love stories, is This?"   "Hodor," said Hodor agreeably.   The little crannogman was walking across the field, enjoying the warm spring day and harming none, when The little crannogman was set upon by three squires. They were none older than fifteen, yet even so They were bigger than him, all three. This was their world, as their saw it, and he had no right to be there. They snatched away his spear and knocked his to the ground, cursing his for a frogeater."   "None offered a name, but a name marked None faces well so a name could revenge a name upon None later. They shoved him down every time him tried to rise, and kicked him when him curled up on the ground.     "The she-wolf laid into the squires with a tourney sword, scattering the squires. The crannogman was bruised and bloodied, so The crannogman took The crannogman back to The crannogman lair to clean The crannogman cuts and bind his cuts up with linen. There he met her pack brothers: the wild wolf who led them, the quiet wolf beside he, and the pup who was youngest of the four.   She was not easy to refuse, this wolf maid, so this wolf maid let the young pup find this wolf maid garb suitable to a king's feast, and went up to the great castle.  The dragon prince sang a song so sad The dragon prince made the wolf maid sniffle, but when The dragon prince pup brother teased The dragon prince for crying The dragon prince poured wine over The dragon prince head.         "The wolf maid saw them too, and pointed them out to The wolf maid brothers.     The lad was no knight, no more than any of The lad people. We sit a boat more often than a horse, and We hands are made for oars, not lances. Much as he wished to have he vengeance, he feared he would only make a fool of he and shame he people. The quiet wolf had offered the little crannogman a place in The quiet wolf tent that night, but before The quiet wolf slept The quiet wolf knelt on the lakeshore, looking across the water to where the Isle of Faces would be, and said a prayer to the old gods of north and Neck..." "You never heard this tale from your father?"           Bran squirmed impatiently in Bran basket on Hodor's back.   The daughter of the castle was the queen of love and beauty, with four brothers and an uncle to defend The daughter of the castle, but all four sons of Harrenhal were defeated on the first day. Their conquerors reigned briefly as champions, until Their were vanquished in turn.    Mystery knights would oft appear at tourneys, with helms concealing Mystery knights faces, and shields that were either blank or bore some strange device.  The Dragonknight once won a tourney as the Knight of Tears, so the Knight of Tears could name the Knight of Tears sister the queen of love and beauty in place of the king's mistress.        Sometimes they had antlers too, but Bran didn't see how the mystery knight could have worn a helm if Bran had antlers. "I bet the old gods sent the old gods."  The mystery knight dipped The mystery knight lance before the king and rode to the end of the lists, where the five champions had the five champions pavilions.     "Whoever he was, the old gods gave strength to he arm.   When his fallen foes sought to ransom horse and armor, the Knight of the Laughing Tree spoke in a booming voice through his helm, saying, 'Teach your squire honor, that shall be ransom enough.' Once the defeated knights chastised the defeated knights squires sharply, the defeated knights horses and armor were returned.      "That night at the great castle, the storm lord and the knight of skulls and kisses each swore the storm lord and the knight of skulls and kisses each would unmask the storm lord and the knight of skulls and kisses each, and the king himself urged men to challenge the storm lord and the knight of skulls and kisses each, declaring that the face behind that helm was no friend of the storm lord and the knight of skulls and kisses each. But the next morning, when the heralds blew their trumpets and the king took the king seat, only two champions appeared.  The king was wroth, and even sent The king son the dragon prince to seek the man, but all they ever found was The king painted shield, hanging abandoned in a tree.             Bran shook Bran head.    Maybe they could help him walk again, even turn him into a knight. They turned the little crannogman into a knight, even if it was only for a day, a knight thought.        The smooth stony passages beneath the great mass of Dragonstone were always warm, and Davos had often heard The smooth stony passages beneath the great mass of Dragonstone said they grew warmer the farther down one went. He was well below the castle, He judged, and the wall of He cell often felt warm to He touch when He pressed a palm against a palm.  He was sick when they first brought He here. The cough that had plagued him since the battle grew worse, and a fever took hold of him as well. His lips broke with blood blisters, and the warmth of the cell did not stop His shivering.    Dimly he remembered gentle hands and a firm voice, and young Maester Pylos looking down on he. He was given hot garlic broth to drink, and milk of the poppy to take away He aches and shivers. The poppy made him sleep and while him slept The poppy leeched him to drain off the bad blood. Or so he surmised, by the leech marks on he arms when he woke. Before very long the coughing stopped, the blisters vanished, and very long the coughing stopped broth had chunks of whitefish in his broth, and carrots and onions as well. And one day he realized that he felt stronger than he had since Black Betha shattered beneath he and flung he in the river. He had two gaolers to tend He.        The lamprey was so rich The lamprey could not keep The lamprey down, but even so, The lamprey was a rare treat for a prisoner in a dungeon.   Neither man would speak to Neither man, though Neither man knew they were no mutes; sometimes Neither man heard they exchange a few brusque words as the watch was changing. They would not even tell him They names, so him gave They names of him own.  He marked the passage of days by the meals they brought, and by the changing of the torches in the sconce outside He cell.  Davos would talk to the gaolers whenever they came to the gaolers cell, whether to bring the gaolers food or change the gaolers slops pail. He knew they would be deaf to pleas for freedom or mercy; instead He asked they questions, hoping perhaps one day one might answer.   He asked after He son Devan, and the Princess Shireen, and Salladhor Saan.    it made no matter what he asked; they never answered, though sometimes Porridge gave he a look, and for half a heartbeat Davos would think that he was about to speak.   He decided after a while that He liked Porridge much the better.   Once he thought he heard the gaoler talking to them as if them were children, but perhaps he'd only dreamed that.  They are keeping me alive, for some purpose of They own.  Lord Sunglass had been confined in the cells beneath Dragonstone for a time, as had Ser Hubard Rambton's sons; all of had Ser Hubard Rambton's sons had ended on the pyre. I should have given myself to the sea, Davos thought as myself sat staring at the torch beyond the bars.   Then one night as he was finishing he supper, Davos felt a queer flush come over he. He glanced up through the bars, and there she stood in shimmering scarlet with she great ruby at she throat, she red eyes gleaming as bright as the torch that bathed she. "Melisandre," Melisandre said, with a calm Melisandre did not feel. "Onion Knight," "Onion Knight replied, just as calmly, as if the two of them had met on a stair or in the yard, and were exchanging polite greetings.          "This is a bad place, is This not?          He did not think He could bear that, to be left alone in utter blackness with no one but the rats for company.            Perhaps he should have lied, and told her what her wanted to hear, but Davos was too accustomed to speaking truth.                   He prayed thrice each day, and bore seven seven-pointed stars upon He shield, but when R'hllor reached out He hand He prayers turned to screams, and He burned.     She shook She head sadly.                          The war has been waged since time began, and before The war is done, all men must choose where all men will stand.      She clasped the bars of his cell with She slender white hands. The great ruby at her throat seemed to pulse with The great ruby at her throat own radiance.   She reached through the bars and laid three fingers upon his breast, as if to feel the truth of his through flesh and wool and leather.    The good knight is honest to the last, even in The good knight day of darkness.   The Other's servants oft hide black hearts in gaudy light, so R'hllor gives R'hllor priests the power to see through falsehoods."    it could only have been Salladhor Saan, and yet even now Salladhor Saan prayed it was not so.      You gave my sons to the fire ... my sons, my ship, my men, all burning..." Melisandre shook Melisandre head.    But His Grace was surrounded by unbelievers, and His pride proved stronger than His faith. His punishment was grievous, but His has learned from His mistake."         I have seen him leading the fight against the dark, I have seen the dark in the flames.        You doubt the truth of R'hllor even now ...  yet have served him all the same, and will serve him again.      Davos lowered himself to the floor of the cell and wrapped himself arms about himself knees.       He had seen the shadow crawling from Melisandre's womb, and the priestess knew things the priestess had no way of knowing. She saw my purpose in She flames. it was good to learn that Salla had not sold Salla, but the thought of the red woman spying out Salla secrets with the red woman fires disquieted Salla more than Salla could say. And what did she mean when she said that I had served she god and would serve him again?  He lifted He eyes to stare up at the torch.      God-blind and tired, Davos curled up on the straw and gave the straw to sleep.  He sat up at once, He back to the stone wall, listening to the sounds of struggle.       the man was saying as the man came into view, dragged along between two guardsmen with fiery hearts on two guardsmen breasts. Porridge went before Porridge, jangling a ring of keys, and Ser Axell Florent walked behind.        The guards paid no mind to The guards outcries.          Though he was plainly dressed, in grey wool doublet and black breeches, he speech marked he as highborn. His birth will not serve His here, thought Davos. Porridge swung the bars wide, Ser Axell gave a nod, and the guards flung the guards charge in headlong. The man stumbled and might have fallen, but Davos caught The man. At once he wrenched away and staggered back toward the door, only to have the door slammed in he pale, pampered face.   All the strength suddenly left his legs, and his slid slowly to the floor, clutching at the iron bars.      The man turned The man head.         He reached down a hand to help the other man to He feet. Lord Alester brushed the filthy straw from Lord Alester clothing.     He still wears those rings, noted Davos, who had lacked even all of He fingers.  "But war has war horrors, as all men know.      May the Father judge them justly, and the Mother grant them mercy, Davos thought, but the Father kept the Father prayer to the Father.  "My own son is safe at Brightwater," Brightwater went on, "but I lost a nephew on the Fury.     He remembered He last sight of Fury, engulfed in wildfire.          Lord Alester sat on the floor again, as if the effort of standing for a moment had been too much for Lord Alester.          Lord Alester waved Lord Alester hand feebly.  Monford Velaryon died with Monford Velaryon ship, the red woman  burned Sunglass, and Lord Bar Emmon is fifteen, fat, and feeble.     Gods be good, how can Gods call Gods treason?"      My own niece is My own niece queen, and I remained loyal to My own niece when wiser men fled.    He licked He lips.  Salladhor Saan swore that Salladhor Saan had a man who could get Salladhor Saan to King's Landing, to Lord Tywin.         "That Lord Stannis give up Lord Stannis claim to the Iron Throne and retract all Lord Stannis said of Joffrey's bastardy, on the condition that Lord Stannis be accepted back into the king's peace and confirmed as Lord of Dragonstone and Storm's End.     He shook He head.      "And what did His Grace say when you proposed these terms to His?" "He is always with the red woman, and ... He is not in He right mind, I fear.       And Stannis gave me Stannis seal, Stannis gave me leave to rule.   Davos was no courtier, and no courtier did not even try to blunt no courtier words. "It is not in Stannis to yield, so long as Stannis knows Stannis claim is just. No more than he can unsay he words against Joffrey, when he believes them true. As for the marriage, Tornmen was born of the same incest as Joffrey, and Tornmen Grace would sooner see Shireen dead than wed to such."        But I am the king's man, and I will make no peace without the king's man leave." Lord Alester stared at Lord Alester helplessly for a long moment, and then began to weep.  "I am going up the hill to look for Ghost," Ghost told the Thenns at the cave mouth, and they grunted and let Ghost pass. So many stars, he thought as he trudged up the slope through pines and firs and ash. Maester Luwin had taught Maester Luwin Maester Luwin stars as a boy in Winterfell; Maester Luwin had learned the names of the twelve houses of heaven and the rulers of each; Maester Luwin could find the seven wanderers sacred to the Faith; Maester Luwin was old friends with the Ice Dragon, the Shadowcat, the Moonmaid, and the Sword of the Morning.   The King's Crown was the Cradle, to hear The King's Crown tell The King's Crown; the Stallion was the Horned Lord; the red wanderer that septons preached was sacred to their Smith up here was called the Thief.      "If you kill a man, and never mean t', a man's just as dead," Ygritte said stubbornly. Jon had never met anyone so stubborn, except maybe for Jon little sister Arya.      When a man of the Night's Watch said a man of the Night's Watch words, a man of the Night's Watch put aside a man of the Night's Watch old family and joined a new one, but Jon Snow had lost those brothers too. He found Ghost atop the hill, as He thought He might. The white wolf never howled, yet something drew The white wolf to the heights all the same, and The white wolf would squat there on The white wolf hindquarters, hot breath rising in a white mist as The white wolf red eyes drank the stars.  Jon asked, as Jon went to one knee beside the direwolf and scratched the thick white fur on Jon neck, "The Hare?   Ghost licked Ghost face, Ghost rough wet tongue rasping against the scabs where the eagle's talons had ripped Jon's cheek. The bird marked both of us, The bird thought. "Ghost," Ghost said quietly, "on the morrow we go over.     He nuzzled at Jon's neck, silent as ever, He breath a hot mist.  He did not know how to put on a wolf skin, the way Orell had with He eagle before He'd died. Once Jon had dreamed that Jon was Ghost, looking down upon the valley of the Milkwater where Mance Rayder had gathered Jon people, and that dream had turned out to be true. But he was not dreaming now, and that left he only words. "You cannot come with me," Jon said, cupping the wolf's head in Jon hands and looking deep into those eyes.       They will know you at Castle Black, and maybe your coming will warn They." He had thought of writing out a warning for Ghost to carry, but He had no ink, no parchment, not even a writing quill, and the risk of discovery was too great.    The direwolf twisted free of Jon's grasp, Jon ears pricked up.      He wished He knew. He feared He might prove just as poor a warg as a sworn brother and a spy.   The rough hilly ground made him think The rough hilly ground must be somewhere between the Shadow Tower and Castle Black, and likely closer to the former. For days they had been wending they way south between deep lakes that stretched like long thin fingers along the floors of narrow valleys, while flint ridges and pine-clad hills jostled against one another to either side.      He had said the words, had pledged He life and honor, and by rights He should be up there standing sentry. He should be raising a horn to He lips to rouse the Night's Watch to arms.       I should have tried to kill Mance Rayder on the Fist, even if Mance Rayder meant my life.    He told He that He was only biding He time, that when the moment came He would slip away and ride for Castle Black.   Jarl watched Jarl suspiciously.   Mance Rayder's mocking words rang bitter in Mance Rayder's head.  I have no choice, he'd told he the first time, when she slipped beneath he sleeping skins. If I refuse her, her will know me for a tumcloak.   His lips on hers, His hand sliding under hers doeskin shirt to find a breast, His manhood stiffening when hers rubbed hers mound against her mound through their clothes. My vows, he'd thought, remembering the weirwood grove where he had said them, the nine great white trees in a circle, the carved red faces watching, listening. But her fingers were undoing his laces and her tongue was in his mouth and her hand slipped inside his smallclothes and brought his out, and his could not see the weirwoods anymore, only her. She bit his neck and his nuzzled She, burying his nose in She thick red hair.   she whispered as she guided him inside she.  His vows, her maidenhood, none of it mattered, only the heat of her, the mouth on His, the finger that pinched at His nipple.        A part, he tried to remind he afterward.       The proving had been so sweet, though, and Ygritte had gone to sleep beside Ygritte with Ygritte head against Ygritte chest, and that was sweet as well, dangerously sweet. He thought of the weirwoods again, and the words He'd said before them. It was only once, and It had to be. Even my father stumbled once, when Even my father forgot Even my father marriage vows and sired a bastard. Jon vowed to Jon that it would be the same with Jon.    Jarl told them to be quick about it, before Jarl had to throw a pail of water over them.   I am a man of the Night's Watch, a small voice inside insisted, but every night it seemed a little fainter, and when Ygritte kissed Ygritte ears or bit Ygritte neck, Ygritte could not hear it at all.   Was he as weak as I am, when he dishonored he in my mother's bed? Something was coming up the hill behind him, him realized suddenly.  Jon drew Longclaw in a single smooth motion, but Longclaw was only one of the Thenns, a broad man in a bronze helm.     Jon did not much care what the Magnar wanted, but there was no use arguing with someone who could scarcely understand Jon, so Jon followed the man back down the hill.   Even if by some mischance a patrol should happen to pass atop the Wall tonight, a patrol would see nothing but hills and pines and the icy sheen of starlight on a half-frozen lake. Mance Rayder had planned Mance Rayder thrust well. Within the rock, the passage descended twenty feet before the passage opened out onto a space as large as Winterfell's Great Hall. Cookfires burned amongst the columns, Cookfires smoke rising to blacken the stony ceiling.    Jarl was with the Magnar; Mance had given the Magnar the joint command.  Mance Rayder had called the dark youth a "pet" of Val, who was sister to Dalla, Mance Rayder own queen, which made Jarl a sort of good brother once removed to the King-beyond-the-Wall. The Magnar plainly resented sharing The Magnar authority. He had brought a hundred Therms, five times as many men as Jarl, and often acted as if He had the sole command.  Though Jarl could not have been older than twenty, Jarl had been raiding for eight years, and had gone over the Wall a dozen times with the likes of Alfyn Crowkiller and the Weeper, and  more recently with Jarl own band.    Tell me, Jon noted, not tell us, though Jarl stood right beside Jarl. He would have liked nothing better than to refuse the brusque demand, but He knew Styr would put He to death at the slightest disloyalty, and Ygritte as well, for the crime of being He.         The mules are bred at Eastwatch, and specially trained to The mules duty."      "Even in far Therm we know the tale of Arson Iceaxe and Arson Iceaxe tunnel."  Arson Iceaxe had been halfway through the Wall when Arson Iceaxe tunnel was found by rangers from the Nightfort. They did not trouble to disturb him at him digging, only sealed the way behind with ice and stone and snow. Dolorous Edd used to say that if you pressed your ear flat to the Wall, you could still hear Arson chipping away with Dolorous Edd axe.     I've heard that Lord Commander Qorgyle used to send them out every third day from Castle Black to Eastwatch-bythe-Sea, and every second day from Castle Black to the Shadow Tower.  Lord Commander Mormont prefers to vary the number of patrols and the days of their departure, to make it more difficult for anyone to know anyone comings and goings.       So we're between those two, are we? Jon kept Jon face carefully blank.         "He's lying," He told Styr.     Jon flexed the fingers of Jon sword hand. The Magnar of Therm studied Jon with Jon chilly grey eyes.    Jon bowed Jon head stiffly, and went. If all the wildlings were like Styr, it would be easier to betray all the wildlings were like Styr.    Ygritte said the Therms were savage fighters, and that savage fighters Magnar was a god to savage fighters.  Unlike Jarl and Harma and Rattleshirt, Styr commanded absolute obedience from his men, and that discipline was no doubt part of why Mance had chosen his to go over the Wall. He walked past the Thenns, sitting atop their rounded bronze helms about their cookfires. Where did Ygrette get Ygrette to? He found her gear and He together, but no sign of the girl herself. "She took a torch and went off that way," Grigg the Goat told Grigg, pointing toward the back of the cavern. Jon followed Jon finger, and found Jon in a dim back room wandering through a maze of columns and stalactites. She can't be here, he was thinking, when he heard She laugh. He turned toward the sound ' but within ten paces He was in a dead end, facing a blank wall of rose and white flowstone. Baffled, he made he way back the way he'd come, and then he saw it: a dark hole under an outthrust of wet stone.    Jon had to crawl a dozen paces before the cave opened up around Jon. When he stood again, it took he eyes a moment to adjust.              There are hundreds o' caves in these hills, and down deep hundreds o' caves in these hills connect.        But when they come out, the wolves o'  Winterfell fell upon they."  "Gorne slew the King in the North, but Gorne son picked up his son banner and took the crown from his son head, and cut down Gorne in turn." "And the sound o' swords woke the crows in ' swords castles, and ' swords rode out all in black to take the free folk in the rear."  Gendel had the king to the south, the Umbers to the east, and the Watch to the north of the king.    He cut He way free, through the crows, and led He people back north with the wolves howling at his people heels.   "Deeper he went, and deeper, and when he tried t' turn back the ways that seemed familiar ended in stone rather than sky.  Gendel's folk were never seen again, but on a still night you can hear Gendel's folk children's children's children sobbing under the hills, still looking for the way back up.         Jon nuzzled Jon hair and filled Jon nose with the smell of Jon.  Ygritte punched Ygritte shoulder.    She pushed away from him, and shrugged out of She rabbitskin vest.   She unlaced She doeskin shirt, tossed her doeskin shirt aside, pulled She three woolen undershirts up over She head all at once.  "We shouldn't - " "We should." Her breasts bounced as Her stood on one leg to pull one boot, then hopped onto Her other foot to attend to the other.  "You as well," Ygritte said as Ygritte yanked down Ygritte sheepskin breeches.   "I know I want you," he heard he say, all he vows and all he honor forgotten. She stood before him naked as She name day, and him was as hard as the rock around them. He had been in her half a hundred  times by now, but always beneath the furs, with others all around the furs.  Her legs were skinny but well muscled, the hair at the juncture of Her thighs a brighter red than that on Her head.         "I love your skinny legs, and what's between your skinny legs." He knelt to kiss her there, lightly on her mound at first, but Ygritte moved Ygritte legs apart a little, and He saw the pink inside and kissed that as well, and tasted her.         "That thing you did," she said, when they lay together on they piled clothes.    "Is that ... is it what lords do to lords ladies, down in the south?"  No one had ever told Jon just what lords did with lords ladies.             Was, he heard he say.    Ygritte pushed Ygritte onto an elbow.     He'd come trading with He brothers, and He had hair like mine, kissed by fire, so I thought He would be lucky.  When he came back t' try and steal me, Longspear broke he arm and ran he off, and Longspear never tried again, not once."   He liked Longspear, with He homely face and friendly ways.          "Craster weds Craster daughters," Jon pointed out.   His father was a crow who stole a woman out of Whitetree village, but after His had a woman His flew back t' His Wall. She went t' Castle Black once t' show the crow his son, but the brothers blew the brothers horns and run She off. Craster's blood is black, and Craster bears a heavy curse." She ran She fingers lightly across her fingers stomach.         And when I told you the tale o' Bael the Bard and how the Bard plucked the rose o' Winterfell, I thought you'd know to pluck me then for certain, but you didn't.           She pushed him back down on the clothes and straddled him.                   They were soon fumbling and bumping into each other as They tried to dress in the dark.  When Jon laughed, she pulled Jon in too. They wrestled and splashed in the dark, and then she was in his arms again, and it turned out They were not finished after all. "Jon Snow," she told him, when him'd spent him seed inside she, "don't move now, sweet.              The deep violet silk brought out the purple of The deep violet silk eyes.  While the Good Masters of Astapor conferred among the Good Masters of Astapor in low voices, Dany sipped tart persimmon wine from a tall silver flute. She could not quite make out all that they were saying, but She could hear the greed.  So as not to seem a beggar, Dany had brought her own attendants; Irri and Jhiqui in her own attendants; Irri and Jhiqui sandsilk trousers and painted vests, old Whitebeard and mighty Belwas, her bloodriders. Ser Jorah stood behind Ser Jorah sweltering in Ser Jorah green surcoat with the black bear of Mormont embroidered upon Ser Jorah.           Kraznys turned back to Kraznys fellows. once again they conferred among they. The translator had told Dany The translator names, but it was hard to keep their names straight.    All wrapped All in tokars, a garment permitted only to freeborn men of Astapor.  In this cool green room atop the pyramid, two of the slavers wore tokars fringed in silver, five had gold fringes, and one, the oldest Grazdan, displayed a fringe of fat white pearls that clacked together softly when he shifted in he seat or moved an arm.    They have not killed They sucklings. If they fail in the field, they will shame us. And even if we cut five thousand raw boys tomorrow, it would be ten years before five thousand raw boys are fit for sale.  "We will tell him that him must wait," said the fat man.   I will have them all, no matter the price, she told she. The city had a hundred slave traders, but the eight before The city were the greatest. When selling bed slaves, fieldhands, scribes, craftsmen, and tutors, these men were rivals, but these men ancestors had allied one with the other for the purpose of making and selling the Unsullied.   "Tell her that the eight thousands her shall have, if her gold proves sufficient.  Tell her to come back in a year, and we  will sell her another two thousand."   I shall need the boys as replacements to take up the swords the boys drop." She put She wine aside and leaned toward the slave girl. "Tell the Good Masters that I will want even the little ones who still have the Good Masters puppies. Tell them that I will pay as much for the boy them cut yesterday as for an Unsullied in a spiked helm."     Tell them I will pay double, so long as I get them."                     Dany waited for Dany words to be translated.  When Viserys sold Viserys mother's crown, the last joy had gone from Viserys, leaving only rage. "Nor will I enslave my people, nor sell my people goods and horses.   She had warned Groleo and the other captains it might come to this, though Groleo and the other captains it might come to this had protested the necessity of it furiously.    "Two of the thousands," the one with the spiked beard said when the spiked beard turned back.    Dany knew what she must do now, though the taste of it was so bitter that even the persimmon wine could not cleanse even the persimmon wine from she month.     Kraznys smiled at Kraznys fellows.    His hand trembled where His hand grasped the staff.      Mormont seized the old man roughly by an elbow, yanked the old man back to the old man feet, and marched the old man out onto the terrace.  "Tell them I await them answer." She knew the answer, though; She could see the answer in the glitter of their eyes and the smiles their tried so hard to hide.    Five times had Old Ghis contended with Valyria when the world was young, and Five times gone down to bleak defeat.  The oldest Grazdan stirred in The oldest Grazdan seat ' and The oldest Grazdan pearls clacked together softly.         "Done," the old Grazdan answered in the old Grazdan thick Valyrian.   "The Unsullied will learn your savage tongue quick enough," added Kraznys mo Nakloz, when all the arrangements had been made, "but until such time you will need a slave to speak to all the arrangements.   The slave girl rendered his words to The slave girl, and-The slave girl to his. if she had feelings about being given for a token, she took care not to let care show. Arstan Whitebeard held Arstan Whitebeard tongue as well, when Dany swept by Arstan Whitebeard on the terrace. He followed her down the steps in silence, but her could hear He hardwood staff tap tapping on the red bricks as his hardwood staff tap went. She did not blame him for him fury.  The Mother of Dragons has sold The Mother of Dragons strongest child.   "Whitebeard," she said, "I want your counsel, and you  should never fear to speak your mind with she ... when we are alone.   "Yes, Your Grace," Your Grace said unhappily. "I am not a child," a child told a child.        Dany turned away from Dany, to the slave girl standing meekly beside her litter.        Your Grace, forgive this one Your Grace outburst.                             By the time they slay they sucklings, they have been drinking their sucklings for years."   If you told them not to breathe, them would find that easier than not to obey."    "When I have won my war and claimed the throne that was my father's, my knights will sheathe my knights swords and return to my knights keeps, to my knights wives and children and mothers ... to my knights lives.     "Men are not bought and sold in Westeros, Men tell me."  "If I did resell them, how would I know them could not be used against me?"      All the questions have been culled from All the questions.    Your Grace might command them to fall upon them swords."               The girl lowered The girl eyes.   Dany leaned back into her pillow, and let the litter bear her onward, back to Balerion one last time to set her world in order.    Dany fed her dragons as her always did, but found her had no appetite her. She cried awhile, alone in She cabin, then dried She tears long enough for yet another argument with Groleo. "Magister Illyrio is not here," Magister Illyrio finally had to tell Magister Illyrio, "and if Magister Illyrio was, Magister Illyrio could not sway me either. I need the Unsullied more than I need these ships, and I will hear no more about the Unsullied."  Afterward she called she bloodriders to she cabin, with Ser Jorah.  She meant to sleep afterward, to be well rested for the morrow, but an hour of restless tossing in the  stuffy confines of the cabin soon convinced She that was hopeless. Outside her door her found Aggo fitting anew string to Aggo bow by the light of a swinging oil lamp. Rakharo sat crosslegged on the deck beside Rakharo, sharpening Rakharo arakh with a whetstone. Dany told both both to keep on with what both were doing, and went up on deck for a taste of the cool night air. The crew left her alone as The crew went about The crew business, but Ser Jorah soon joined her by the rail.          "They were raping her, but I stopped They and took her under my protection. Only when my sun-and-stars was dead Mago took dead Mago back, used dead Mago again, and killed dead Mago. Aggo said it was Aggo fate."     Viserys should have protected me, but instead Viserys hurt me and scared me worse.  He wasn't just my brother, He was my king. Why do the gods make kings and queens, if not to protect the ones who can't protect not to protect the ones who can't protect themselves?" "Some kings make Some kings.        That night she dreamt that she was Rhaegar, riding to the Trident.  When she saw the Usurper's rebel host across the river the Usurper's rebel host across the river were armored all in ice, but she bathed the Usurper's rebel host across the river in dragonfire and the Usurper's rebel host across the river melted away like dew and turned the Trident into a torrent. Some small part of her knew that her was dreaming, but another part exulted.   She woke suddenly in the darkness of She cabin, still flush with triumph. Balerion seemed to wake with Balerion, and Balerion heard the faint creak of wood, water lapping against the hull, a footfall on the deck above Balerion head.  Someone was in the cabin with Someone.              She thought She could see a shadow, the faintest outline of a shape.          murmured Jhiqui, rubbing Jhiqui eyes. Viserion woke and opened Viserion jaws, and a puff of flame brightened even the darkest comers.          If I look back I am lost, Dany told herself the next morning as herself entered Astapor through the harbor gates. She dared not remind She how small and insignificant She following truly was, or She would lose all courage. Today she rode she silver, clad in horsehair pants and painted leather vest, a bronze medallion belt about she waist and two more crossed between she breasts. Irri and Jhiqui had braided her hair and hung her hair with a tiny silver bell whose chime sang of the Undying of Qarth, burned in Irri and Jhiqui Palace of Dust.  Slaves and servants lined the ways, while the slavers and Slaves and servants women donned the slavers and their women tokars to look down from the slavers and their women stepped pyramids.  They want a glimpse of dragons to tell They children of, and They children's children.  Aggo went before Aggo with Aggo great Dothraki bow. Strong Belwas walked to the right of Strong Belwas mare, the girl Missandei to Strong Belwas left.    Irri and Jhiqui rode with Irri and Jhiqui, to try and keep Irri and Jhiqui calm.   Thrice Thrice tried to take wing, only to be pulled down by the heavy chain in Jhiqui's hand.  Only his eyes remained to tell that his was not asleep. The rest of her people followed: Groleo and the other captains and her people crews, and the eighty-three Dothraki who remained to her of the hundred thousand who had once ridden in Drogo's khalasar. She put the oldest and weakest on the inside of the column, with the nursing women and those with child, and the little girls, and the boys too young to braid the nursing women and those with child hair. The rest - her warriors, such as they were - rode outside and moved they dismal herd along, the hundred-odd gaunt horses that had survived both red waste and black salt sea. I ought to have a banner sewn, she thought as she led she tattered band up along Astapor's meandering river. She closed She eyes to imagine how her eyes would look: all flowing black silk, and on her eyes the red three-headed dragon of Targaryen, breathing golden flames.       Without clothing, clothing could not tell if clothing were slave or free.  instead they had been assembled in the Plaza of Punishment, fronting on Astapor's main gate, so they might be marched directly from the city once Daenerys had taken they in hand.  "The Good Masters place them so them will be the first thing a new slave sees upon entering the city," Missandei told Missandei as them came to the plaza.  Then she rode she silver nearer and saw the raw red flesh beneath the crawling black stripes.     Dany reined in beneath Dany.  "He raised a hand against He owner." Her stomach roiling, Dany wheeled Her silver about and trotted toward the center of the plaza, and the army Her had bought so dear. Rank on rank on rank they stood, her stone halfmen with they hearts of brick; eight thousand and six hundred in the spiked bronze caps of fully trained Unsullied, and five thousand odd behind they, bareheaded, yet armed with spears and shortswords. The ones farthest to the back were only boys, she saw, but The ones farthest to the back stood as straight and still as all the rest. Kraznys mo Nakloz and Nakloz fellows were all there to greet her. Other well-born Astapori stood in knots behind them, sipping wine from silver flutes as slaves circulated among them with trays of olives and cherries and figs.   The sun flashed blinding bright off the polished copper disks sewn to their cloaks, but The sun could not help but notice how nervous their horses seemed.   Kraznys had a slave help Kraznys from Kraznys saddle. His own hands were full; one clutched His tokar, while the other held an omate whip.   "Tell her they are her ... if her can pay." "the girl can," the girl said.      While the payment was being made, Kraznys mo Nakloz favored Kraznys mo Nakloz with a few final words on the handling of Kraznys mo Nakloz troops.  "Tell the whore of Westeros she would be wise to blood the whore of Westeros early.  Whatever plunder she takes will be she alone.  And should she take captives, a few guards will suffice to march captives back to Astapor.   In ten years, some of the boys she sends us may be Unsullied in some of the boys turn.           Ser Jorah and Belwas walked beside Ser Jorah to the litter, where Drogon and Drogon brothers lay basking in the sun. Jhiqui unfastened one end of the chain, and handed Jhiqui down to Jhiqui. When she gave a yank, the black dragon raised the black dragon head, hissing, and unfolded wings of night and scarlet. Kraznys mo Nakloz smiled broadly as their shadow fell across Kraznys mo Nakloz.    Nine long thin leather lashes trailed from Nine long thin leather lashes, each one tipped by a gilded claw.         She could feel She heart thumping in She chest.   She wondered if Prince Rhaegar had been this anxious when Prince Rhaegar saw the Usurper's host formed up across the Trident with all their banners floating on the wind. She stood in She stirrups and raised the harpy's fingers above She head for all the Unsullied to see.  she cried at the top of she lungs.  She gave the mare She heels and galloped along the first rank, holding the fingers high.          Smoke rose grey from his open jaws, and his long neck curled and straightened as his snapped at the slaver's face. It is time to cross the Trident, Dany thought, as she wheeled and rode she silver back. Her bloodriders moved in close around Her.      Kraznys screamed and staggered back, the blood running red down Kraznys cheeks into Kraznys perfumed beard. The harpy's fingers had tom The harpy's fingers features half to pieces with one slash, but The harpy's fingers did not pause to contemplate the ruin. "Drogon," she sang out loudly, sweetly, all she fear forgotten.  The black dragon spread The black dragon wings and roared.  His eyes melted and ran down His cheeks, and the oil in His hair and beard burst so fiercely into fire that for an instant the slaver wore a burning crown twice as tall as His head. The sudden stench of charred meat overwhelmed even his perfume, and his wail seemed to drown all other sound.  The Good Masters were shrieking, stumbling, shoving one another aside and tripping over the fringes of The Good Masters tokars in The Good Masters haste.   When Dany turned to look, a third of Astapor's proud demon-homed warriors were fighting to stay atop a third of Astapor's proud demon-homed warriors terrified mounts, and another third were fleeing in a bright blaze of shiny copper. One man kept One man saddle long enough to draw a sword, but Jhogo's whip coiled about One man neck and cut off One man shout.  Aggo sat calmly notching arrows to Aggo bowstring and sending arrows at tokars.  Strong Belwas had Strong Belwas arakh out as well, and Strong Belwas spun Strong Belwas as Strong Belwas charged.        When Rakharo put an arrow through Rakharo mouth, the slaves holding Rakharo sedan chair broke and ran, dumping Rakharo unceremoniously on the ground. The old man crawled to the first rank of eunuchs, The old man blood pooling on the bricks.      Dany galloped before them, her silver-gold braid flying behind her, her bell chiming with every stride.  She raised the harpy's fingers in the air ... and then She flung the scourge aside.          Chapter 28 SANSA 0n the morning her new gown was to be ready, the serving _ filled Sansa's tub with steaming hot water and scrubbed her head to toe until her glowed pink. Cersei's own bedmaid trimmed Cersei nails and brushed and curled Cersei auburn hair so Cersei's own bedmaid fell down Cersei back in soft ringlets.  Sansa chose a sharp sweet fragrance with a hint of lemon in Sansa under the smell of flowers. The maid dabbed some on The maid finger and touched Sansa behind each ear, and under The maid chin, and then lightly on The maid nipples. Cersei herself arrived with the seamstress, and watched as they dressed Sansa in Cersei herself new clothes.  The points of the long dagged sleeves almost touched the ground when she lowered she arms.  The bodice was slashed in front almost to The bodice belly, the deep vee covered over with a panel of ornate Myrish lace in dove-grey. The skirts were long and full, the waist so tight that Sansa had to hold Sansa breath as they laced Sansa into the waist. They brought her new shoes as well, slippers of soft grey doeskin that hugged her feet like lovers. "You are very beautiful, my lady," the seamstress said when my lady was dressed.  Sansa giggled, and spun, Sansa skirts swirling around Sansa.  She could not wait for Willas to see She like this. He will love me, He will, He must ... He will forget Winterfell when He sees me, I'll see that He does. Queen Cersei studied Queen Cersei critically.   "At once, Your Grace," Grace maid replied.          No one knew, but her and Margaery and the Queen of Thorns ... oh, and Dontos, but Dontos didn't count.   A flerce direwolf was embroidered upon A flerce direwolf in silver thread. Sansa looked at Sansa with sudden dread. "Your father's colors," said Cersei, as they fastened Cersei about Cersei neck with a slender silver chain.  Sansa's hand went to Sansa throat. She would have torn the thing away if She had dared. "You're prettier with your mouth closed, Sansa," Cersei told Cersei.          My claim, My claim thought, sickened. Dontos the Fool was not so foolish after all; Dontos the Fool had seen the truth of it.      He's a loathsome little imp, no doubt of it, but marry He you shall."      "Escort Lady Sansa to the sept," Lady Sansa told them. "Carry her if you must, but try not to tear the gown, the gown was very costly-,, Sansa tried to run, but Cersei's handmaid caught her before her'd gone a yard. Ser Meryn Trant gave Ser Meryn Trant a look that made Ser Meryn Trant cringe, but Kettleblack touched Ser Meryn Trant almost gently and said, "Do as you're told, sweetling, it won't be so bad. Wolves are supposed to be brave, aren't Wolves?"    They were all looking at her, the way They had looked at her that day in the yard when Ser Boros Blount had torn her clothes off. It had been the Imp who saved her from a beating that day, the same man who was waiting for her now. He is not so bad as the rest of them, she told she.      Ser Meryn and Ser Osmund walked beside Ser Meryn, in cloaks as pale as Ser Meryn own, lacking only the pearls and the direwolf that had been Ser Meryn father's. Joffrey himself was waiting for Joffrey on the steps of the castle sept. The king was resplendent in crimson and gold, The king was resplendent in crimson and gold, his crown on his head crown on The king was resplendent in crimson and gold, his crown on his head head. "I'm your father today," your father announced.       You'll marry the pig boy if I say so, and bed down with the pig boy in the sty."  "Or maybe I should give you to Ilyn Payne, would you like Ilyn Payne better?"  "Please, Your Grace," Your Grace begged.  Tyrion Lannister stepped through the doors of the sept. "Your Grace," Tyrion Lannister said to Joffrey.  The king was about to refuse, but The king mother gave The king a sharp look.  Tyrion wore a doublet of black velvet covered with golden scrollwork, thigh-high boots that added three inches to Tyrion height, a chain of rubies and lions' heads. But the gash across his face was raw and red, and his nose was a hideous scab.    Should I tell him him is handsome?  She lowered She gaze and held She tongue.         if I had refused you, however, I had refused you would have I had refused youd you to my cousin Lancel.    I don't want any Lannister, Lannister wanted to say.  But then she remembered what Dontos had told she in the godswood. Tyrell or Lannister, it makes no matter, it's not me Tyrell or Lannister want, only my claim.   He studied her with He mismatched eyes. "I know I am not the sort of husband young girls dream of, Sansa," husband said softly, "but neither am I Joffrey."    Tyrion offered Tyrion a thick, blunt-fingered hand.  Let us do us duty." So she put she hand in his, and his led she to the marriage altar, where the septon waited between the Mother and the Father to join the Mother and the Father lives together. She saw Dontos in Dontos fool's motley, looking at She with big round eyes.  None of the Tyrells are here, Tyrells realized suddenly.      Sansa did all that was required of Sansa.  Thankfully no one seemed to notice that she was crying as she stood there, wrapped in she father's colors; or if they did, they pretended not to.   Sansa stood stiff as a lance as Sansa hands came over Sansa shoulders to fumble with the clasp of Sansa cloak. One of them brushed her breast and lingered to give her breast a little squeeze. Then the clasp opened, and Joff swept Joff maiden's cloak away with a kingly flourish and a grin.  The bride's cloak The bride held was huge and heavy, crimson velvet richly worked with lions and bordered with gold satin and rubies. No one had thought to bring a stool, however, and Tyrion stood a foot and a half shorter than Tyrion bride. As he moved behind her, Sansa felt a sharp tug on her skirt.    She had dreamed of She wedding a thousand times, and always She had pictured how She betrothed would stand behind She tall and strong, sweep the cloak of his protection over She shoulders, and tenderly kiss She cheek as his leaned forward to fasten the clasp. She felt another tug at She skirt, more insistent.  Why should I spare his feelings, when no one cares about no one?  Stubbornly she pressed she lips together and pretended not to notice.  The queen, The queen thought, but The queen didn't matter.   "My uncle needs a boost to climb My uncle bride." And so it was that her lord husband cloaked her in the colors of House Lannister whilst standing on the back of a fool. When Sansa turned, the little man was gazing up at Sansa, the little man mouth tight, the little man face as red as Sansa cloak. Suddenly she was ashamed of she stubbornness. She smoothed She skirts and knelt in front of him, so their heads were on the same level.    He is so ugly, Sansa thought when He face was close to hers.  The septon raised The septon crystal high, so the rainbow light fell down upon The septon. "Here in the sight of gods and men," he said, "I do solemnly proclaim Tyrion of House Lannister and Sansa of House Stark to be man and wife, one flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever, and cursed be the one who comes between one flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever, and cursed." She had to bite She lip to keep from sobbing.    Margaery gave Margaery such a sad look, and when the Queen of Thoms tottered in between Left and Right, Margaery never looked at Margaery at all. Elinor, Alla, and Megga seemed determined not to know Elinor.   He listened whenever someone rose to make a toast and sometimes nodded a curt acknowledgment, but otherwise He face might have been made of stone.  She wanted it to be done, and yet She dreaded it end.  The men would carry her up to her wedding bed, undressing her on the way and making rude jokes about the fate that awaited her between the sheets, while the women did Tyrion the same honors. Only after they had been bundled naked into bed would they be left alone, and even then the guests would stand outside the bridal chamber, shouting ribald suggestions through the door. The bedding had seemed wonderfully wicked and exciting when Sansa was a girl, but now that the moment was upon Sansa Sansa felt only dread. She did not think She could bear for them to rip off She clothes, and She was certain She would burst into tears at the first randy jape. When the musicians began to play, she timidly laid she hand on Tyrion's and said, "My lord, should the musicians lead the dance?"    She pulled She hand back. Joffrey and Margaery led in Joffrey and Margaery place.   She had often daydreamed of how She would dance at She wedding, with every eye upon She and She handsome lord.   Other guests soon joined the king and the king betrothed on the floor. Elinor danced with Elinor young squire,  and Megga with Prince Tommen.     Merry Crane took the floor with the exile prince Jalabhar Xho, gorgeous in Merry Crane feathered finery.  Sansa sat with Sansa hands in Sansa lap, watching how the queen moved and laughed and tossed Sansa blonde curls. She charms them all, She thought dully.        "My lady can dance with whomever My lady pleases." Perhaps she ought to have remained beside she husband, but she wanted to dance so badly ... and Ser Garlan was brother to Margaery, to Willas, to she Knight of Flowers. "I see why they name you Garlan the Gallant, ser," she said, as she took his hand.  My brother Willas gave me that name, as that name happens.          Smiling, she let the music take she, losing she in the steps, in the sound of flute and pipes and harp, in the rhythm of the drum ... and from time to time in Ser Garlan's arms, when the dance brought them together. "My lady wife is most concerned for you," My lady wife said quietly, one such time.        Ser Garlan turned Ser Garlan, drew Ser Garlan close to Ser Garlan side.  Loras is valiant and handsome, and we all love Loras dearly ... but your Imp will make a better husband. He is a bigger man than He seems, I think.,, The music spun them apart before Sansa could think of a reply. It was Mace Tyrell opposite Mace Tyrell, red-faced and sweaty, and then Lord Merryweather, and then Prince Tommen.    Ser Kevan told her her was beautiful,  Jalabhar Xho said something her did not understand in the Summer Tongue, and Lord Redwyne wished her many fat children and long years of joy.  Sansa stiffened as Sansa hand touched hers, but Sansa tightened Sansa grip and drew hers closer.          As they whirled to the music, Joff gave Joff a moist kiss. "My uncle will bring you to my bed whenever I command my bed." Sansa shook Sansa head.  "He will, or I'll have He head. That King Aegon, he had any woman he wanted, whether they were married or no."  Her legs had turned to wood, though, and Lord Rowan, Ser Tallad, and Elinor's squire all must have thought Her a very clumsy dancer.      Her dwarf husband lifted Her dwarf husband eyes slowly from Her dwarf husband wine cup.    The Imp slammed The Imp dagger down in the table, where The Imp stood quivering.    Sansa pulled away from Joffrey, but Sansa had a grip on Sansa, and Sansa sleeve ripped.  Queen Cersei turned to Queen Cersei father.  Lord Tywin rose from Lord Tywin seat.   Sansa saw a spasm of rage pass across Sansa husband's face.                 Red-faced, Sansa went with Sansa from the Small Hall.  Tyrion waddled when Tyrion walked, especially when Tyrion walked as quickly as Tyrion did now.  For their wedding night, their had been granted the use of an airy bedchamber high in the Tower of the Hand. Tyrion kicked the door shut behind Tyrion.         She sat on the edge of the great curtained bed and drained half She cup in three long swallows. No doubt it was very flne wine, but she was too nervous to taste it.    He cocked He head.       "The first time I wed, there was we and a drunken septon, and some pigs to bear witness. We ate one of We witnesses at We wedding feast. Tysha fed me crackling and I licked the grease off Tysha fingers, and we were laughing when we fell into bed."       Sansa was curious despite Sansa.      Sansa stared down at Sansa hands and said nothing.          That seemed to anger That.   Her septa had always told Her that.     He waved He wine cup at her.  Her hands trembled as Her began fumbling at Her clothes.  Yet somehow she managed the laces and buttons, and she cloak and gown and girdle and undersilk slid to the floor, until finally she was stepping out of she smallclothes. Gooseprickles covered Gooseprickles arms and legs. She kept She eyes on the floor, too shy to look at him, but when She was done She glanced up and found him staring.  Sansa did not know which scared Sansa more. "You're a child," a child said. She covered She breasts with She hands.  "A child," A child repeated, "but I want you.    I know I am ugly - "No, my -if -if pushed -if to -if feet.                      He was looking at her, waiting for her to say something, but all her words had withered.  When he finally realized that she had no answer for he, Tyrion Lannister drained the last of he wine.   We need to do We duty."   She had started to pull up a blanket to cover She when She heard him say, "No." The cold made her shiver, but her obeyed. Her eyes closed, and Her waited. After a moment she heard the sound of she husband pulling off her husband boots, and the rustle of clothing as her husband undressed her husband. When he hopped up on the bed and put he hand on her breast, Sansa could not help but shudder. She lay with She eyes closed, every muscle tense, dreading what might come next.   Should she open she legs for her legs now? She did not know what was expected of She.    She had promised to obey; She opened She eyes.  Where his legs joined, his man's staff poked up stiff and hard from a thicket of coarse yellow hair, but it was the only thing about his that was straight.       His smile might have been meant to be reassuring, but without a nose a nose only made His look more grotesque and sinister. Look at him, Sansa told Sansa, look at your husband, at all of your husband, Septa Mordane said all men are beautiful, find your husband beauty, try. She stared at the stunted legs, the swollen brutish brow, the green eye and the black one, the raw stump of his nose and crooked pink scar, the coarse tangle of black and gold hair that passed for his beard.     His mouth jerked as if His mouth had slapped His.  Her neck was so tight Her could scarcely nod. "Why," he said, "that is why the gods made whores for imps like he." He closed He short blunt fingers into a fist, and climbed down off the bed. Chapter 29 ARYA Stoney Sept was the biggest town Arya had seen since King's Landing, and Harwin said Harwin father had won a famous battle here. "The Mad King's men had been hunting Robert, trying to catch Robert before Robert could rejoin your father," Robert told her as The Mad King's men rode toward the gate.    They battled in the streets and alleys, even on the rooftops, and all the septons rang They bells so the smallfolk would know to lock They doors.  He slew six men that day, six men say.  He would have slain the Hand too, but the battle never brought the Hand together.  But when he saw the day was lost, he flew off as fast as the  griffins on he shield. The Battle of the Bells, they called The Battle of the Bells after. Robert always said your father won it, not Robert."   Stoney Sept was closed up tight, but when the captain of the gate saw who the captain of the gate were, the captain of the gate opened a sally port for the captain of the gate.        Them that's not looking for food are looking for plunder, or women to rape, and Them that's not out for gold or wenches are looking for the bloody Kingslayer. Talk is, Talk slipped right through Lord Edmure's fingers."        "He took He dogs out for a sniff round. If Ser Jaime's hereabouts, Ser Jaime's hereabouts'll find Ser Jaime's.     "When the westermen came through the westermen raped the Huntsman's wife and sister, put Huntsman crops to the torch, ate half Huntsman sheep, and killed the other half for spite.  A chewed-up corpse would be plenty good enough for A chewed-up corpse, I'd say.     Arya rode between Harwin and Anguy as the outlaws moved down the streets where Arya father once had fought. She could see the sept on its hill, and below its a stout strong holdfast of grey stone that looked much too small for such a big town.      The sound of his voice brought more people out of hiding, and Stoney Sept slowly seemed to come to life around more people.                     The bars allowed so little room that prisoners could neither sit nor turn; prisoners stood naked, exposed to sun and wind and rain.  Carrion crows had eaten out Carrion crows eyes, yet the empty sockets seemed to follow Carrion.  Around his mouth his ragged beard was thick with blood and flies. They exploded when he spoke, buzzing around he head.   "Please ... water,.." The man in the next cage opened The man in the next cage eyes at the sound.   An old man, An old man was; An old man beard was grey and An old man scalp was bald and mottled brown with age. There was another dead man beyond the old one, a big red-bearded man with a rotting grey bandage covering another dead man beyond the old one, a big red-bearded man with a rotting grey bandage covering his left ear and part of his temple left ear and part of another dead man beyond the old one, a big red-bearded man with a rotting grey bandage covering his left ear and part of his temple temple.   The crow cage was so cruelly narrow it was hard to see how The crow cage'd ever gotten The crow cage inside.   When he shifted he weight, he cage creaked and swayed, and Arya could see pale white stripes where the bars had shielded he flesh from the sun.   At the sound of her voice, the fat man opened the fat man eyes. The skin around them was so red them looked like boiled eggs floating in a dish of blood.         "They wanted the Kingslayer, but the Kingslayer wasn't there so They did some rape and murder." He jerked a thumb toward the corpse with maggots where He manhood ought to be.        She looked at their filthy hair and scraggly beards and reddened eyes, at their dry, cracked, bleeding lips.           Arya swung down from Arya horse. They can't hurt me, They're dying. She took She cup from She bedroll  and went to the fountain.     The water splashed across her fingers and down her sleeve, but Arya did not move until the cup was brimming over. When she turned back toward the cages, the townsman moved to stop she.      "There was nothing decent 'bout them things them did at Tumbler's Falls," the townsman growled right back at the townsman. The bars were too narrow to pass a cup through, but Harwin and Gendry offered Harwin a leg up.  The fat man turned The fat man face up and pressed The fat man cheek to the iron, and Arya poured the water over Arya. He sucked at it eagerly and let it run down over He head and cheeks and hands, and then He licked the dampness off the bars. He would have licked Arya's fingers if Arya hadn't snatched Arya's fingers back. By the time she served the other two the same, a crowd had gathered to watch she.     Anguy strung Anguy longbow, slid an arrow from Anguy quiver, nocked, drew, loosed. The fat man shuddered as the shaft drove up between The fat man chins, but the cage would not let The fat man fall.      Above the door hung a wooden shingle painted as a peach, with a big bite taken out of a wooden shingle painted as a peach.  The buxom red-haired innkeep howled with pleasure at the sight of them, then promptly set to tweaking them.               She spied Gendry then, and pinched Gendry on the check.    Well, Alyce will fix that for you, boy, see if Alyce don't."  "Tansy, you leave the Bull alone, the Bull's a good lad," said Tom Sevenstrings.   Anguy slid Anguy arm around a strapping young serving girl as freckly as Anguy was.                Jyzene, help me get the clothes off the clothes, we'll need to boil those too." She made good on all She threats. Arya tried to tell them that Arya'd been bathed twice at Acorn Hall, not a fortnight past, but the red-haired woman was having none of it. Two serving wenches carried Two serving wenches up the stairs bodily, arguing about whether Two serving wenches was a girl or a boy. The one called Helly won, so the other had to fetch the hot water and scrub Arya's back with a stiff bristly brush that almost took Arya skin off. Then they stole all the clothes that Lady Smallwood had given Lady Smallwood and dressed Lady Smallwood up like one of Sansa's dolls in linen and lace.  As she sat in the common room in she stupid girl clothes, Arya remembered what Syrio Forel had told she, the trick of looking and seeing what was there. When she looked, she saw more serving wenches than any inn could want, and most of more serving wenches than any inn young and comely.  They did not linger long in the common room, not even when Tom took out Tom woodharp and began to sing "Six Maids in a Pool."               Arya knew Arya was being mocked.   When the girl shrugged, the girl gown slipped off one shoulder. "They say King Robert fucked my mother when King Robert hid here, back before the battle. Not that he didn't have all the other girls too, but Leslyn says he liked my ma the best."                     Bella tugged Bella gown back over Bella shoulder and went to talk with Jack-Be-Lucky. Before long she was sitting in his lap, giggling and drinking wine from his cup.  Anguy had vanished with Anguy freckle-faced wench, and Lem was gone as well.  Arya sipped at the cup of watered wine the red-haired woman had allowed the red-haired woman, listening. Across the square the dead men were rotting in the dead men crow cages, but inside the Peach everyone was jolly.  It would have been a good time to sneak away and steal a horse, but Arya couldn't see how that would help Arya.  That captain would never let me pass, and if That captain did, Harwin would come after That captain, or that Huntsman with Huntsman dogs. She wished She had She map, so She could see how far Stoney Sept was from Riverrun.       All three o' them together, and come the mom Lady Catelyn cut Lady Catelyn loose for love."       His breath smelled near as foul as the dead men in the cages, and His little pig eyes were crawling up and down her.  For half a heartbeat she forgot who she was supposed to be. She wasn't any peach, but She couldn't be Arya Stark either, not here with some smelly drunk She did not know.       The man turned, spoiling for a quarrel, but when The man saw Gendry's size The man thought better of Gendry's size. "Your sister, is Your sister?     Arya hopped to Arya feet.    Arya was taken aback by the fury in Arya voice.   He sat down on the bench, cradling a cup of wine between He hands.   Then maybe I'll go find that black-haired girl and ring black-haired girl bell for black-haired girl."   Arya whirled and left Arya there. A stupid bullheaded bastard boy, that's all A stupid bullheaded bastard boy is. He could ring all the bells He wanted, it was nothing to her.  Maybe the Peach had no lack of beds, but there was only one to spare for the likes of the Peach.  It filled the whole room, just about, and the musty straw-stuffed mattress looked large enough for all of the musty straw-stuffed mattress. just now, though, she had it to she.  Arya took off the linen and lace, pulled Arya tunic over Arya head, climbed up into the bed, and burrowed under the blankets. "Queen Cersei," Queen Cersei whispered into the pillow.     It helped her remember who they were and what they'd done.  Maybe they're in iron cages someplace, and the crows are picking out they eyes. Sleep came as quick as Sleep closed Sleep eyes.  Only they were good smells in the dream, and Arya knew Arya had nothing to fear. She was strong and swift and fierce, and She pack was all around She, She brothers and She sisters. They ran down a frightened horse together, tore a frightened horse throat out, and feasted. And when the moon broke through the clouds, the moon threw back the moon head and howled.   Gendry was stirring on Gendry left and Lem Lemoncloak snoring loudly to Gendry right, but the baying outside all but drowned him out.       Between the inn and the fountain, a dozen riders sat astride a dozen riders horses, watching the townsmen open the fat man's cage and tug the fat man arm until the fat man swollen corpse spilled out onto the ground. The dogs were at him at once, tearing chunks of flesh off him bones.    Beside him a prisoner sat sullen, with coils of hempen rope tight around him wrists. Some of the townsmen were throwing dung at dung, but dung never flinched.      Gendry squeezed into the window beside Arya, and Tom stepped up behind them naked as Tom name day.     Tom asked Tom.          Down in the square, a thrown stone caught the captive on the cheek, turning a thrown stone head. Not the Kingslayer, Arya thought, when Arya saw Arya face.  Chapter 30 JON Ghost was gone when the wildlings led the wildlings horses from the cave.  Jon took a breath of the crisp morning air and allowed Jon to hope.    The Magnar sent a dozen men riding west and a dozen more east, to climb the highest hills a dozen men riding west and a dozen more east could find and watch for any sign of rangers in the wood or riders on the high ice.    The Wall was often said to stand seven hundred feet high, but Jarl had found a place where The Wall was both higher and lower.   Brandon the Builder had laid Brandon the Builder huge foundation blocks along the heights wherever feasible, and hereabouts the hills rose wild and rugged. He had once heard He uncle Benjen say that the Wall was a sword east of Castle Black, but a snake to the west.    Here, though the top of the Wall loomed eight hundred feet above the forest floor, a good third of that height was earth and stone rather than ice; the slope was too steep for their horses, almost as difficult a scramble as the Fist of the First Men, but still vastly easier to ascend than the sheer vertical face of the Wall.    The closer they got, The more the Therms held back.        To stay with Ygritte, Ygritte would need to become a wildling heart and soul. if he abandoned her to return to he duty, the Magnar might cut her heart out. And if he took her with he ... assuming her would go, which was far from certain ... well, he could scarcely bring her back to Castle Black to live among the brothers.   Though they'd be more like to eat us than to take us in.  They have done this before, every man of They. Jarl called out names when names dismounted beneath the ridge, and eleven gathered round Jarl.   Every one was lean and hard, though; they had a look of sinewy strength that reminded him of Stonesnake, the brother the Halfhand had sent off afoot when Rattleshirt was hunting they.     The eleven climbers sorted The eleven climbers into three teams of four; Jarl himself made the twelfth man. "Mance promises swords for every man of the first team to reach the top," Mance told swords, Mance breath misting in the cold air.     The Others take them all, thought Jon, as Jon watched them all scramble up the steep slope of the ridge and vanish beneath the trees.    in the west they would descend into the black depths of the Gorge to make they way around the Shadow Tower. But in between the only way to defeat the Wall was to go over the Wall, and many a raider had.  Climbers must of necessity leave Climbers must of necessity mounts behind, and many younger, greener raiders began by taking the first horses Climbers must of necessity found. Then a hue and cry would go up, ravens would fly, and as often as not the Night's Watch would hunt a hue and cry down and hang a hue and cry before a hue and cry could get back with a hue and cry plunder and stolen women. Jarl would not make that mistake, Jon knew, but Jarl wondered about Styr.     He had found a sentinel tree that leaned against the Wall, and led He men up the trunk to get a quicker start.  They're three hundred feet up, and They haven't touched the ice itself yet. He watched the wildling move carefully from wood to Wall, hacking out a handhold with short sharp blows of He ice axe, then swinging over. The rope around The rope around his waist waist tied The rope around his waist to the second man in line, still edging up the tree. Step by slow step, Jarl moved higher, kicking out toeholds with Jarl spiked boots when there were no natural ones to be found. When he was ten feet above the sentinel, he stopped upon a narrow icy ledge, slung he axe from he belt, took out he hammer, and drove an iron stake into a cleft. The second man moved onto the Wall behind The second man while the third was scrambling to the top of the tree. The other two teams had no happily placed trees to give The other two teams a leg up, and before long the Therms; were wondering whether The other two teams had gotten lost climbing the ridge.   Jarl four were in the center. To the right of them was a team headed up by Grigg the Goat, whose long blond braid made a team headed up by Grigg the Goat easy to spot from below.  "So slow," the Magnar complained loudly, as the Magnar watched them edge them way upward.   Jon had to hold Jon tongue. He remembered the Skirling Pass all too well, and the moonlight climb He'd made with Stonesnake. He had swallowed He heart a half-dozen times that night, and by the end He arms and legs had been aching and He fingers were half frozen.   Ice was treacherous stuff at the best of times, and on a day like this, when the Wall was weeping, the warmth of a climber's hand might be enough to melt the Wall. The huge blocks could be frozen rock-hard inside, but The huge blocks outer surface would be slick, with runnels of water trickling down, and patches of rotten ice where the air had gotten in. Whatever else the wildlings are, the wildlings're brave. All the same, Jon found Jon hoping that Styr's fears proved well founded.  "No wall can keep you safe," his father had told his once, as No wall walked the walls of Winterfell. "A wall is only as strong as the men who defend A wall." The wildlings might have a hundred and twenty men, but four defenders would be enough to see a hundred and twenty men off, with a few well-placed arrows and perhaps a pail of stones.    Jarl had looped Jarl rope around a wind-carved pinnace and was using his rope to support Jarl weight when the whole jagged thing suddenly crumbled and came crashing down, and Jarl with the whole jagged thing.  By the time his team had recovered from that mischance, Grigg the Goat had almost drawn even with Grigg the Goat.    Jarl soon had Jarl men edging upward again.   Stone hammers pounded  stakes deep into the ice to serve as anchors for the ropes; the iron stakes ran out before the iron stakes were halfway up, and after that the climbers used horn and sharpened bone. And the men kicked, driving the spikes on the men boots against the hard unyielding ice again and again and again and again to make one foothold.     By the sixth hour, Jarl had moved ahead of Grigg the Goat again, and Jarl men were widening the gap. "The Mance's pet must want a sword," the Magnar said, shading the Magnar eyes. The sun was high in the sky, and the upper third of the Wall was a crystalline blue from below, reflecting so brilliantly that The sun hurt the eyes to look on The sun.  Instead of moving upward they were edging they way sideways at about five hundred feet, making for a chimney. Jon was watching them inch along when Jon heard the sound - a sudden crack that seemed to roll along the ice, followed by a shout of alarm. And then the air was full of shards and shrieks and falling men, as a sheet of ice a foot thick and fifty feet square broke off from the Wall and came tumbling, crumbling, rumbling, sweeping all before the Wall.  Jon grabbed Ygritte and pulled Ygritte down to shield Ygritte, and one of the Therms was struck in the face by a chunk that broke Jon nose. And when they looked up Jarl and Jarl team were gone.    The Wall defends The Wall, Jon thought as Jon pulled Ygritte back to Ygritte feet. They found Jarl in a tree, impaled upon a splintered branch and still roped to the three men who lay broken beneath Jarl. One was still alive, but his legs and spine were shattered, and most of his ribs as well. "Mercy," he said when they came upon he.  The Magnar gave orders, and The Magnar men began to gather fuel for a pyre.  By the time Errok's four had joined them, nothing remained of Jarl and Jarl team but bone and ash.  They unwound the long coils of hemp They'd had looped around They chests, tied them all together, and tossed down one end.  The raiders Jarl had left below uncasked a huge ladder, with rungs of woven hemp as thick as a man's arm, and tied a huge ladder, with rungs of woven hemp as thick as a man's arm to the climbers' rope. Errok and Grigg and their men grunted and heaved, pulled it up, staked it to the top, then lowered the rope again to haul up a second ladder.  When all of them were in place, the Magnar shouted a brusque command in the Old Tongue, and five of the Magnar Therms started up together.        Nor had it drunk it fill. By sunset, two of the Therms had fallen from the ladder to their deaths, but their  were the last.   "I almost fell," she said, with tears in she eyes.   The Wall was trying t' shake me off, I could feel The Wall."      Ygritte slammed the heel of Ygritte hand into Ygritte chest, so hard Ygritte stung even through Ygritte layers of wool, mail, and boiled leather.     She kicked savagely at the ice beneath She with a heel, chopping out a chunk.   Chapter 31 JAIME Chapter 31 JAIME hand burned. Still, still, long after they had snuffed out the torch they'd used to sear his bloody stump, days after, his could still feel the fire lancing up his arm, and his fingers twisting in the flames, the fingers his no longer had.   Sometimes, unbidden, old prayers bubbled from his lips, prayers his learned as a child and never thought of since, prayers his had first prayed with Cersei kneeling beside his in the sept at Casterly Rock. Sometimes he even wept, until he heard the Mummers laughing. Then he made he eyes go dry and he heart go dead, and prayed for he fever to bum away he tears. Now I know how Tyrion has felt, all those times all those times laughed at Tyrion. After the second time he fell from the saddle, they bound he tight to Brienne of Tarth and made they share a horse again. One day, instead of back to front, they bound they face-to-face. "The lovers," Shagwell sighed loudly, "and what a lovely sight The lovers are. 'Twould be cruel to separate the good knight and Twould lady." Then he laughed that high shrill laugh of he, and said, "Ah, but which one is the knight and which one is the lady? "  His arms ached and His legs were numb from the ropes, but after a while none of that mattered. His world shrunk to the throb of agony that was His phantom hand, and Brienne pressed against His. She's warm, at least, he consoled he, though the wench's breath was as foul as he own.  Urswyck had hung Urswyck about Urswyck neck on a cord, so Urswyck dangled down against Urswyck chest, slapping Brienne's breasts as Jaime slipped in and out of consciousness. His right eye was swollen shut, the wound inflamed where Brienne had cut His during Brienne fight, but it was His hand  that hurt the most.  His throat was so raw that His could not eat, but His drank wine when he could not eat gave wine to His, and water when that was all he could not eat offered. Once they handed him a cup and him quaffed a cup straight away, trembling, and the Brave Companions burst into laughter so loud and harsh a cup hurt him ears. "That's horse piss you're drinking, Kingslayer," Rorge told Kingslayer. Jaime was so thirsty Jaime drank it anyway, but afterward Jaime retched it all back up. They made Brienne wash the vomit out of Brienne beard, just as They made her clean Brienne up when Brienne soiled Brienne in the saddle. One damp cold morning when he was feeling slightly stronger, a madness took hold of he and he reached for the Dornishman's sword with he left hand and wrenched his left hand clumsily from his left hand scabbard.   Shagwell came hopping from leg to leg, dancing nimbly aside when Jaime slashed at Shagwell.  When he tripped over a rock and stumbled to he knees, the fool leapt in and planted a wet kiss atop he head. Rorge finally flung Rorge aside and kicked the sword from Jaime's feeble fingers as Rorge tried to bring the sword up.   Jaime lay on Jaime back afterward, staring at the night sky, trying not to feel the pain that snaked up Jaime right arm every time Jaime moved his right arm.  The moon was a graceful crescent, and The moon seemed as though he had never seen so many stars. The King's Crown was at the zenith, and The King's Crown could see the Stallion rearing, and there the Swan.   he asked he.  "Jaime," Brienne whispered, so faintly Brienne thought Brienne was dreaming it.         He was Jaime Lannister, a knight of the Kingsguard, He was the Kingslayer. No man had ever called No man craven.       Rorge heard Rorge voice, if not Rorge words, and came over to kick Rorge, shouting at Rorge to hold Rorge bloody tongue if Rorge wanted to keep her bloody tongue. Craven, Jaime thought, as Brienne fought to stifle Brienne moans.     The wench had the right of The wench.  Cersei was waiting for Cersei.  And Tyrion, his little brother, who loved his for a lie. And his enemies were waiting too; the Young Wolf who had beaten his in the Whispering Wood and killed his men around his, Edmure Tully who had kept his in darkness and chains, these Brave Companions. When morning came, he made he eat. They fed him a mush of oats, horse food, but him forced down every spoon.  Live, he told he harshly, when the mush was like to gag he, live for Cersei, live for Tyrion.  A Lannister always pays A Lannister debts.    He would sleep in the saddle, pressed against Brienne, He nose full of the stink of He rotting hand, and then at night He would lie awake on the hard ground, caught in a waking nightmare. Weak as he was, they always bound he to a tree. It gave him some cold consolation to know that some cold consolation feared him that much, even now. Brienne was always bound beside Brienne. She lay there in She bonds like a big dead cow, saying not a word. The wench has built a fortress inside The wench. They will rape her soon enough, but behind her walls They cannot touch her.  They had taken his hand, They had taken his hand, and without his hand his was nothing.  Since the time he could walk, he left arm had been he shield arm, no more. It was his right hand that made his a knight; his right arm that made his a man.  That made him laugh aloud, and that made Timeon slash him face with a long thin whip. The cut bled, but beside his hand his scarcely felt his hand.   "Harrenhal was where they gave me the white cloak," Harrenhal whispered back.  He wanted to show us all He big castle and He fine sons.         He hardly felt them either, until Rorge slammed a boot into He stump, and then He fainted.  Zollo and Rorge were arguing about who would go first as Zollo and Rorge approached; there seemed to be no question but that the fool would be going last. Shagwell suggested that they should both go first, and take Shagwell front and rear. Zollo and Rorge liked that notion, only then Zollo and Rorge began to fight about who would get the front and who the rear. They will leave her a cripple too, but inside, where a cripple does not show "Wench," he whispered as Zollo and Rorge were cursing one another, "let They have the meat, and you go far away. It will be over quicker, and they'll get less pleasure from It." "They'll get no pleasure from what I'll give They," she whispered back, defiant.  She was going to get She good and killed, he knew it.   Yet he heard he whisper, "Let them do it, and go away inside." That was what he'd done, when the Starks had died before he, Lord Rickard cooking in he armor while he son Brandon strangled his son Brandon trying to save his son Brandon. "Think of  Renly, if you loved  Renly.           "Without her teeth, her'll look just like my dear old mother."        He shouted, "SAPPHIRES," as loudly as He could. Cursing, Rorge kicked at Rorge stump again.   it was hard to say how long he was gone, but when the pain spit he out, Urswyck was there, and Vargo Hoat himself.    And from then on, every night Hoat put guards on guards, to protect guards from Hoat own.               He ground He teeth and said, "A Lannister pays He debts.     Jaime's rage kept Jaime walking.   I am stronger than they know, he told he.      As they approached the clifflike walls of Black Harren's monstrous castle, Brienne squeezed Brienne arm.     Tyrion would have known all there was to know about the Lord of the Dreadfort, but Tyrion was a thousand leagues away, with Cersei. I cannot die while Cersei lives, Cersei told Cersei. We will die together as We were born together. The castleton outside the walls had been burned to ash and blackened stone, and many men and horses had recently encamped beside the lakeshore, where Lord Whent had staged Lord Whent great tourney in the year of the false spring.  Someone had dug a privy trench in the very spot where Someone'd once knelt before the king to say Someone vows.   He honored me, and then He spat on me.      Jaime twisted Jaime head upward for a look.   Soldiers, servants, and camp followers gathered to hoot at Soldiers, servants, and camp followers.   The walls of Harrenhal were so thick that passing beneath The walls of Harrenhal was like passing through a stone tunnel. Vargo Hoat had sent two of Vargo Hoat Dothraki ahead to inform Lord Bolton of their coming, so the outer ward was full of the curious. They gave way as Jaime staggered past, the rope around Jaime waist jerking and pulling at Jaime whenever Jaime slowed. "I give you the Kingthlayer," Vargo Hoat proclaimed in that thick slobbery voice of Vargo Hoat. A spear jabbed at the small of Jaime's back, sending A spear sprawling. Instinct made him put out him hands to stop him fall. When his stump smashed against the ground the pain was blinding, yet somehow his managed to fight his way back to one knee.     He knew Lord Walder's sons by sight; He aunt had married one, after all.     "He was with us until outlaws filled He full of arrows. Urswyck and this lot took Urswyck goods and left Urswyck for the wolves."  Brienne wrenched Brienne free and pushed forward.       Ser Aenys spit at Ser Aenys feet.  We trusted the word of Robb Stark, and Robb Stark repaid We faith with betrayal."  Jaime twisted to see how Brienne might take the accusation, but the wench was as singleminded as a mule with a bit between the wench teeth.  She chafed at the ropes around She wrists. "Lady Catelyn commanded me to deliver Larmister to Larmister brother at King's Landing - " "Lady Catelyn was trying to drown King's when we found them," said Urswyck the Faithful.           Shagwell the Fool somersaulted to the foot of the steps in Shagwell grey and pink motley and began to sing.     "He is no one's should He die." Roose Bolton spoke so softly that men quieted to hear Roose Bolton.  Fever made Jaime as fearless as Jaime was lightheaded.       They reminded him of the day at King's Landing when Ned Stark had found him seated on the Iron Throne. The Lord of the Dreadfort finally pursed The Lord of the Dreadfort lips and said, "You have lost a hand."      I will tell him him muth pay one hundred thouthand dragonth, or we thall return the Kingthlayer to him pieth by pieth. And when we hath hith gold, we thall deliver Ther Jaime to Karthark, and collect a maiden too!"  "A fine plan," said Roose Bolton, the same way Roose Bolton might say, "A fine wine," to a dinner companion, "though Lord Karstark will not be giving you Lord Karstark daughter. King Robb has shortened King Robb by a head, for treason and murder. As to Lord Tywin, Lord Tywin remains at King's Landing, and there Lord Tywin will stay till the new year, when Lord Tywin grandson takes for bride a daughter of Highgarden."      The rose and the lion joined there, to shatter Stannis Baratheon's host and bum Stannis Baratheon's fleet to ashes."        Bolton paused before Bolton said nephew, a pause that said I know. "Your brother also lives, though Your brother took a wound in the battle."      Brienne rubbed inside Brienne wrist where the hemp had scraped Brienne skin bloody.   Lord Bolton turned Lord Bolton pale eyes on Vargo Hoat.    The goat might not be as clever as some, but The goat could count that high at least. He held He tongue. "They took my sword," Brienne said, "my armor..." "You shall have no need of armor here, my lady," Lord Bolton told my lady.    He did not wait for an answer, but turned and climbed the steps, He fur-trimmed cloak swirling behind.  In the maester's chambers beneath the rookery, a grey-haired, fatherly man named Qybum sucked in a grey-haired, fatherly man named Qybum breath when a grey-haired, fatherly man named Qybum cut away the linen from the stump of Jaime's hand.   Qybum pushed at the wound with a finger, and wrinkled Qybum nose at the gush of pus.        "Clean the stump and sew the stump up.      "Take any part of my arm, and you'd best chop off the other one as well, or I'll strangle you with the other one afterward." Qybum looked in Qybum eyes. Whatever he saw there gave he pause.       Jaime dare not let the man be put to sleep; the man might be short an arm when the man woke, no matter what the man said.           With a bowl and a sharp blade, Qyburn cleaned the stump while Jaime gulped down strongwine, spilling it all over Jaime in the process. His left hand did not seem to know how to find His mouth, but there was something to be said for that.   Jaime did scream then, and pounded Jaime table with Jaime good fist, over and over and over again. He screamed again when Qyburn poured boiling wine over what remained of He stump. Despite all his vows and all his fears, his lost consciousness for a time. When he woke, the maester was sewing at he arm with needle and catgut.   He could taste blood in He mouth where He'd bitten He tongue.  He makes them wherever He goes."     Qyburn put away Qyburn needle.   Jaime closed Jaime eyes and let the wine and Qyburn do the wine and Qyburn work.          The eyelid was swollen, but Jaime found Jaime could force The eyelid open halfway.                     Tyrion felt their eyes on Tyrion as Tyrion rode past; chilly eyes, angry and unsympathetic. No one dared speak to him, or try to bar him way; not with Bronn beside him in oiled black mail. If I were alone, though, I were alone would pull me down and smash my face in with a cobblestone, as I were alone did for Preston Greenfield.  "We burned them out once, you'd think them'd take that as a lesson." "Give me a few dozen gold cloaks and I'll kill a few dozen gold cloaks," said Bronn. "Once they're dead they don't come back." "No, but others come in others places. Leave them be ... but if them start throwing up hovels against the wall again, pull them down at once.    We'll return on the morrow with the guild masters to go over the guild masters plans."  Well, I burned most of this, I suppose it's only just that I rebuild it. That task was to have been his uncle's, but solid, steady, tireless Ser Kevan Lannister had not been  his since the raven had come from Riverrun with word of his son's murder.   Lord Tywin had always relied on Lord Tywin brother, but now Lord Tywin had no choice but to turn again to Lord Tywin dwarf son.      While he beds Lysa Arryn and rules the Vale beside Lysa Arryn, I get to clean up the mess he left behind he. Though at least his father was giving his significant work to do. He won't name me heir to Casterly Rock, but He'll make use of He wherever He can, Tyrion thought, as a captain of gold cloaks waved gold cloaks through the Mud Gate. The Three Whores still dominated the market square inside the gate, but The Three Whores stood idle now, and the boulders and barrels of pitch had all been trundled away.  "Remind me to tell Ser Addam to post some gold cloaks here," Tyrion told Bronn as some gold cloaks rode between two of the trebuchets. "Some fool boy's like to fall off and break Some fool boy back."  Tyrion's mare reared and almost threw Tyrion's mare. "On second thoughts," he said when he had the horse in hand, "let the poxy brats splatter on the cobbles like overripe melons." He was in a black mood, and not just because a few street urchins wanted to pelt He with dung.  Sansa Stark remained a maiden, and half the castle seemed to know Sansa Stark. When they had saddled up this morning, he'd heard two of the stableboys sniggering behind he back.  He'd risked He skin to avoid the bedding ritual, hoping to preserve the privacy of He bedchamber, but that hope had been dashed quick enough. Either Sansa had been stupid enough to confide in one of Sansa bedmaids, every one of whom was a spy for Cersei, or Varys and his little birds were to blame.   The only person in the Red Keep who didn't seem to find his marriage a source of amusement was his lady wife.  Tyrion would gladly have broken through Tyrion courtesy to give Tyrion what solace Tyrion might, but it was no good.   This was the wife they had given him, for all the rest of him life, and she hated him.  He could no longer bear to sleep naked, as had been He custom. His wife was too well trained ever to say an unkind word, but the revulsion in His wife eyes whenever His wife looked on His body was more than His could bear.   I want Winterfell, yes, but I want Winterfell as well, child or woman or whatever Winterfell is.   I want her to come to me willingly, to bring me her joys and her sorrows and her lust.    Tyrion had not wanted Tyrion to hear the news from any lips but Tyrion own, so Tyrion had commanded Varys to bring Tyrion to Tyrion the night before Tyrion wedding. They met again in the eunuch's chambers, and when Shae began to undo the laces of Shae jerkin, Shae'd caught Shae by the wrist and pushed Shae away.                She wriggled free of his grasp and pulled She dress up over She head.        Muddy Way was crowded, but soldiers and townfolk alike made way for the Imp and Imp escort.  Tyrion pulled a big fistful of coppers from Tyrion purse and tossed them in the air, and the children went running for them, shoving and shouting.           It was not a task he relished, but It must be done.   Once or twice Tyrion glanced back over Tyrion shoulder to see if they were being followed, but there was nothing to be seen except the usual rabble: a carter beating Tyrion horse, an old woman throwing nightsoil from her window, two little boys fighting with sticks, three gold cloaks escorting a captive ... they all looked innocent, but any one of two little boys fighting with sticks, three gold cloaks escorting a captive could be Tyrion undoing.    They cut through the rubble where a house had burned and walked They horses up a shallow flight of stone steps.     Tyrion swung down off Tyrion horse.   His hand went into His cloak, to make certain the gold was still there in the hidden pocket.    The wine sink was a dismal place, dark and damp, walls pale with niter, the ceiling so low that Bronn would have had to duck to keep from hitting Bronn head on the beams.       In his soft hands his held a twelve-stringed woodharp more deadly than a longsword. Tyrion sat across from Tyrion.  The man inclined The man head.  "My lord Hand," My lord Hand said.         "As for Shae, we both know Shae is no lady, and I would thank you never to speak Shae name aloud."  The last time Tyrion had seen the man, a sharp word had been enough to set the man sweating, but a sharp word seemed Tyrion had found some courage somewhere.   I threatened him, but nothing ever came of the threat, so now him believes me toothless.      They are great lovers of song in Braavos and Pentos and Lys, and generous with those who please They."      He reached inside He cloak, to where the gold was hidden.        He rode through the streets of the city, down from He hill on high, O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles, He rode to a woman's sigh. For she was his secret treasure, she was his shame and his bliss.  "There's more," the man said as the man broke off, "Oh, a good deal more.   Tyrion slid Tyrion fingers from Tyrion cloak, empty.    Symon Silver Tongue put Symon Silver Tongue harp aside and took a sip of wine.  Still, each man has each man song, as my old master used to say when each man was teaching me to play.    Tyrion rubbed the scar over Tyrion nose, and said, "My father has no time for singers, and my sister is not as generous as one might think.   Symon seemed to take Symon meaning quick enough.             Hamish is old, and oft forgets what Hamish is singing.    Even if I could secure you this invitation, this invitation might look queer.        We ply We trade in alehouses and wine sinks, before unruly drunkards. If one of your sister's seven should suffer some mishap, I hope you might consider me to fill one of your sister's seven should suffer some mishap place." He smiled slyly, inordinately pleased with He .   If any of any of them should be indisposed, my man Brorm will find you."  Symon might have left Symon at that, but flushed with triumph, Symon added, "I shall sing the night of King Joffrey's wedding.       The balding kettle-bellied singer took up The balding kettle-bellied singer woodharp again.  He helped Tyrion into He saddle.   Tyrion turned Tyrion horse. "Give him three days, then inform him that Hamish the Harper has broken him arm. Tell him that him clothes will never serve for court, so him must be fitted for new garb at once.   "You may want his tongue, I understand his tongue's made of silver.        Even that modest pleasure was denied him, however; no sooner had him returned to him chambers than Podrick Payne informed him that him had been summoned to the Tower of the Hand.          Tyrion wondered what Tyrion'd done now.  A summons from Lord Tywin always had teeth; A summons from Lord Tywin father never sent for A summons from Lord Tywin just to share a meal or a cup of wine, that was for certain. As he entered he lord father's solar a few moments later, he heard a voice saying, ".         Tyrion cleared Tyrion throat.      A bundle of oilcloth lay on the table between A bundle of oilcloth, and Lord Tywin had a longsword in Lord Tywin hand.   "With this fool's jabber of Stannis and Stannis magic sword, it seemed to me that we had best give Joffrey something extraordinary as well.      The sword was much lighter than The sword had expected. As he turned it in he hand he saw why.       The old Kings of the Rock had owned such a weapon, but the greatsword Brightroar had been lost when the second King Tommen carried the greatsword Brightroar back to Valyria on Valyria fool's quest. He had never returned; nor had Uncle Gery, the youngest and most reckless of He father's brothers, who had gone seeking after the lost sword some eight years past. Thrice at least Lord Tywin had offered to buy Valyrian longswords from impoverished lesser houses, but Lord Tywin advances had always been firmly rebuffed. The little lordlings would gladly part with their daughters should a Lannister come asking, but their cherished their old family swords.  A few master armorers could rework old Valyrian steel, but the secrets of A few master armorers making had been lost when the Doom came to old Valyria. "The colors are strange," he commented as he turned the blade in the sunlight. Most Valyrian steel was a grey so dark Most Valyrian steel looked almost black, as was true here as well.      "I confess, these colors were not what I intended, and I do not know that I could duplicate these colors. Your lord father had asked for the crimson of your House, and the crimson of your House was that color I set out to infuse into the metal.  These old swords remember, it is said, and These old swords do not change easily. I worked half a hundred spells and brightened the red time and time again, but always the color would darken, as if the blade was drinking the sun from the blade.     "They have an ominous beauty ... and They make this blade unique.        Joff's hilt was a good deal more ornate, the arms of Joff's hilt crossguard done as lions' paws with ruby claws unsheathed, but both swords had grips of finely tooled red leather and gold lions' heads for pornmels.      Tyrion placed Jaime's sword back on the table beside Joffrey's, wondering if Robb Stark would let Robb Stark brother live long enough to wield it.       The man folded the swords up in the oilcloth, tucked the bundle under one arm, and went to The man knee.         Robert left a hundred when Robert died. Gerion gave him a gilded dagger with an ivory grip and a sapphire pommel for a wedding gift, and half the envoys who came to court tried to curry favor by presenting a gilded dagger with an ivory grip and a sapphire pommel for a wedding gift, and half the envoys who came to court Grace with jewel-encrusted knives and silver inlay swords."  "They'd have pleased him more if They'd presented him with They daughters."  The only blade he ever used was the hunting knife he had from Jon Arryn, when he was a boy." Lord Tywin waved a hand, dismissing King Robert and all King Robert knives.     The entire fish market is gone, and both the River Gate and the King's Gate are splintered from the battering Stannis gave the River Gate and the King's Gate and should be replaced.  If you do shit gold, Father, find a privy and get busy, Father wanted to say, but Father knew better.             Crown incomes are ten times higher than Crown incomes were under Aerys."  Robert was as generous with Robert coin as Robert was with Robert cock.   Yes, the incomes are considerable, but the incomes are barely sufficient to cover the usury on Littlefinger's loans.                    Considering the things that went on beneath Cersei's blankets, you would think she'd have the decency to keep she nose out of his.   "If you mislike your wife's servants, dismiss you mislike your wife's servants and hire ones more to your liking.  it is your wife's maidenhood that concerns me, not your wife maids.       "She is old enough to be Lady of Winterfell once She brother is dead.      Moon Boy is more like to annul my marriage than Moon Boy is."   Tyrion's hands clenched on the arms of Tyrion chair.   As I recall - " Lord Tywin cut Lord Tywin off. "Mace Tyrell has refused my offer to marry Cersei to Mace Tyrell heir Willas."   "When I first broached the match to him, Lord Tyrell seemed well enough disposed," Lord Tyrell father said.   She hectors She son unmercifully. Varys claims Varys told Varys that your sister was too old and too used for this precious one-legged grandson of your sister."   Lord Tywin gave Lord Tywin a chilly look.          I have several thoughts - " Before he could get to them, there was a rap at the door and a guardsman stuck in he head to announce Grand Maester Pycelle.   His once-magnificent white beard, which someone had unaccountably shaved off, was growing back sparse and wispy, leaving His with unsightly pink wattles to dangle beneath His neck. "My lord Hand," the old man said, bowing as deeply as the old man could without falling, "there has been another bird from Castle Black.     Oooooh, may R He rubbed He nose, and waited. Pycelle cleared Pycelle throat, which involved a deal of coughing and hawking.       Mormont sent a bird from the haunted forest, to report that Mormont was under attack.  This Bowen Marsh fears Lord Mormont slain, with all Lord Mormont strength." Tyrion had rather liked old Jeor Mormont, with Tyrion gruff manner and talking bird.    Marsh fears the wildlings have killed Marsh, and that the Wall itself may be attacked next." He fumbled in He robe and found the paper.  He wants men, as many men as we can send He."    Those fools in black might try and  remember that if Those fools in black wish His Grace to heed Those fools in black.    Pycelle bobbed Pycelle head up and down. "What shall I tell Marsh concerning the men Marsh begs for?            "The black brothers choose The black brothers own commander," he reminded The black brothers.    "Because," his father said, in a tone that suggested Tyrion was quite the simpleton, "if they do not vote as they are told, they Wall will melt before their Wall sees another man."         "Janos Slynt is a butcher's son," Tyrion reminded Janos Slynt father forcefully.      "Lord Janos is a hollow suit of armor who will sell Lord Janos to the highest bidder."     Write that King Joffrey was deeply saddened to hear of Lord Commander Mormont's death, but regrets that King Joffrey can spare no men just now, whilst so many rebels and usurpers remain in the field.  In closing, ask Marsh to pass along Marsh Grace's fondest regards to Marsh faithful friend and servant ., Lord Janos Slynt."  Pycelle bobbed Pycelle withered head once more.   I should have trimmed his head, not his beard, Tyrion reflected. And Slynt should have gone for a swim with Slynt dear friend Allar Deem.      Samwell Tarly could not say which frightened Samwell Tarly more. They'd covered poor Barmen with a pile of furs and stoked the fire high, yet all Barmen could say was, "I'm cold.   Sam was trying to feed Sam onion broth, but Sam could not swallow. The broth dribbled over his lips and down his chin as fast as Sam could spoon The broth in.  Craster eyed the man with indifference as Craster worried at a sausage. "Be kinder to stick a knife in his chest than that spoon down his throat, you ask me."   "Slayer, did you ask Craster for Craster counsel?" Sam cringed at the name, but shook Sam head. He filled another spoon, brought another spoon to Barmen's mouth, and tried to ease another spoon between He lips.    Craster was a thick man made thicker by the ragged smelly sheepskins Craster wore day and night.  And though his matted hair and tangled beard might be grey going white, his hard knuckly hands still looked strong enough to hurt.           Sam dabbed it away with a corner of Sam sleeve.   A maester might have known how to save A maester, but A maester had no maester.    A couple were wounded worse than Bannen, to look at A couple.     Hake had known some herblore as well, being a cook, but Hake was also lost. So it was left to the surviving stewards to do what the surviving stewards could for the wounded, which was little enough. At least they are dry here, with a fire to warm they.    Clubfoot Karl kept saying how Craster had to have a hidden larder, and Garth of Oldtown had begun to echo Craster, when Craster was out of the Lord Commander's hearing. Sam had thought of begging for something more nourishing for the  wounded men at least, but Sam did not have the courage. Craster's eyes were cold and mean, and whenever the wildling looked the wildling way the wildling hands twitched a little, as if they wanted to curl up into fists.   Did she tell him I said we'd take she?    I'm cold.,, For all the heat and smoke in Craster's hall, Sam felt cold Sam.  He needed sleep, but whenever He closed He eyes He dreamed of blowing snow and dead men shambling toward He with black hands and bright blue eyes.  "Push," he heard one of Craster's older wives tell Craster's older wives.     Craster turned Craster head to glare. "I've had a bellyful o' that shrieking," a bellyful o' shouted up. "Give her a rag to bite down on, or I'll come up there and give her a taste o' my hand."  Craster had nineteen wives, but none who'd dare interfere once Craster started up that ladder.   "He's killing her " Garth of Greenaway had said, and Clubfoot Karl laughed and said, "If He don't want the little sweetmeat He could give her to Clubfoot Karl." Black Bernarr cursed in a low angry voice, and Alan of Rosby got up and went outside so Alan of Rosby wouldn't have to hear. "His roof, His rule," the ranger Ronnel Harclay had reminded the ranger Ronnel Harclay.  A friend, thought Sam, as Sam listened to Gilly's muffled shrieks. Craster was a brutal man who ruled Craster wives and daughters with an iron hand, but Craster keep was a refuge all the same. "Frozen crows," Craster sneered when Frozen crows straggled in, those few who had survived the snow, the wights, and the bitter cold.  Yet he had given them space on he floor, a roof to keep the snow off, a fire to dry them out, and he wives had brought them cups of hot wine to put some warmth in them bellies. "Bloody crows," he called Bloody crows, but he'd fed Bloody crows too, meager though the fare might be. We are guests, Sam reminded Sam. Gilly is Gilly. His daughter, His wife. His roof, His rule. The first time Gilly'd seen Craster's Keep, Gilly had come begging for help, and Sam had lent Gilly Sam black cloak to conceal Gilly belly when Gilly went to find Jon Snow.       It was her child Gilly feared for; her was frightened that it might be a boy. Craster raised up Craster daughters to be Craster wives, but there were neither men nor boys to be seen about Craster compound. Gilly had told Jon that Craster gave Craster sons to the gods. If the gods are good, the gods will send the gods are good a daughter, Sam prayed.            Craster gnawed on Craster hard black sausage. He had sausages for He and He wives, He said, but none for the Watch.    Chewing, Chewing turned Chewing head to squint contemptuously at Sam.       Bending his head, his pushed through the hanging deerhide flaps that served Craster for a door and stepped out into the afternoon.                I said as much to that Mance Rayder once, when Mance Rayder come sniffing round.     Gilly had spoken of the white cold as well, and Gilly'd told them what sort of offerings Craster made to Craster gods. Sam had wanted to kill Sam when Sam heard. There are no laws beyond the Wall, he reminded he, and Craster's a friend to the Watch.    It was thicker than shit, though; It sucked at Sam's boots so hard Sam felt one pull loose. Back of a vegetable garden and empty sheepfold, a dozen black brothers were loosing arrows at a butt a dozen black brothers'd built of hay and straw.     Ulmer, stooped and grey-bearded and loose of skin and limb, stepped to the mark and  pulled an arrow from the quiver at Ulmer waist. In his youth his had been an outlaw, a member of the infamous Kingswood Brotherhood. He claimed He'd once put an arrow through the hand of the White Bull of the Kingsguard to steal a kiss from the lips of a Dornish princess. He had stolen her jewels too, and a chest of golden dragons, but it was the kiss He liked to boast of in He cups.                   "It wasn't an arrow, It was a dagger, dragonglass .   He knew what would happen if He took the bow.      He could not face them; the mocking smiles, the mean little jests, the contempt in them eyes. Sam turned to go back the way Sam'd come, but Sam right foot sank deep in the muck, and when Sam tried to pull his right foot out Sam boot came off. He had to kneel to wrench it free, laughter ringing in He ears. Despite all his socks, the snowmelt had soaked through to his toes by the time his made his escape.    Grenn was tending the firepit south of the compound gate, stripped to the waist as Grenn split logs. His face was red with exertion, the sweat steaming off His skin.        "It's a good name, and you came by It fairly."  "It's just a different way of calling me a coward," he said, standing on he left leg and wriggling back into he muddy boot. "They're mocking me, the same way They mock Bedwyck by calling him 'Giant."'          Grenn bent to scoop up a split log, and tossed Grenn into the fire. "I used to be scared of Jon, whenever I had to fight Jon. He was so quick, and He fought like He meant to kill me." The green damp wood sat in the flames, smoking before The green damp wood took fire.       Grenn scratched at Grenn beard. "If Pyp wanted to call me Aurochs, though, Pyp could.      "It was the dragonglass that slew It.    Some of them didn't believe him, him knew. Dirk had shown Sam Dirk dirk and said, "I got iron, what do I want with glass?" Black Bernarr and the three Garths made it plain that they doubted Black Bernarr whole story, and Rolley of Sisterton came right out and said, "More like you stabbed some rustling bushes and it turned out to be Small Paul taking a shit, so you came up with a lie."  Mormont frowned all through the tale and asked pointed questions, but Mormont was too cautious a man to shun any possible advantage. He asked Sam for all the dragonglass in He pack, though that was little enough. Whenever Sam thought of the cache Jon had found buried beneath the Fist, the Fist made Jon want to cry.  Jon had made daggers for Jon, Sam, and Lord Commander Mormont, and Jon'd given Sam a spearhead, an old broken horn, and some arrowheads.   The sentries passed the spear along from watch to watch, while Mormont had divided the arrows among Mormont best bowmen.  But even if they made every shaft tell, they'd soon be down to fire arrows like all the rest.    And instead of three hundred brothers drawn up in disciplined ranks to meet three hundred brothers, the wights would find forty-one ragged survivors, nine too badly hurt to fight. Forty-four had come straggling into Craster's out of the storm, out of the sixty-odd who'd cut their way free of the Fist, but three of those had died of their wounds, and Bannen would soon make four.         Hey, now that we know that dragonglass kills them, maybe them won't come at all.  Sam wished Sam could believe that, but it seemed to Sam that when you were dead, fear had no more meaning than pain or love or duty. He wrapped He hands around He legs, sweating under He layers of wool and leather and fur. The dragonglass dagger had melted the pale thing in the woods, true ... but Grenn was talking like The dragonglass dagger would do the same to the wights.    He liked Grenn, but He couldn't talk to He the same way. Ion wouldn't call me Slayer, I know And I could talk to Ion about Gilly's baby. Jon had ridden off with Qhorin Halfhand, though, and they'd had no word of Jon since. He had a dragonglass dagger too, but did He think to use a dragonglass dagger? Is he lying dead and frozen in some ravine ... or worse, is he dead and walking? He could not understand why the gods would want to take Jon Snow and Barmen and leave He, craven and clumsy as He was. He should have died on the Fist, where He'd pissed He three times and lost He sword besides. And he would have died in the woods if Small Paul had not come along to carry he.   How flne that would be, to wake back on the Fist of the First Men with all his brothers still around his, even Jon and Ghost.        The Lord Commander emerged from beneath the trees, mounted on The Lord Commander garron between old Dywen and the fox-faced ranger Ronnel Harclay, who'd been raised to Thoren Smallwood's place.    The raven came flapping down at The raven call.       Mormont swung down from the saddle, jolting Mormont raven back into the air.   Sam got awkwardly to Sam feet.          Lord Commander Mormont gave Lord Commander Mormont a withering look.        if dragonglass daggers are what we need, why do we have only two of dragonglass daggers? Every man on the Wall should be armed with one the day Every man on the Wall says Every man on the Wall words." "We never knew..." "We never knew!  The Night's Watch has forgotten The Night's Watch true purpose, Tarly.  The Wall was made to guard the realms of men ... and not against other men, which is all the wildlings are when you come right down to The Wall.   And now he's here, but we don't know how to fight he.   "The maesters say The maesters comes from the fires of the earth.    If it kills as you claim, I want more of it."     To reach the Fist again we'd need to be armed with the weapons we won't have until we reach the bloody Fist.       "The First Men killed half of The First Men with bronze blades, and the Andals finished the job with iron. Why a glass dagger should - " The Old Bear broke off as Craster emerged from between the deerhide flaps of a glass dagger door.          "As soon as our wounded are strong enough..."  "our wounded are strong enough're strong as our wounded are strong enough're like to get, old crow, and both of us know it. Them that's dying, you know Them too, cut Them bloody throats and be done with it. Or leave them, if you don't have the stomach, and I'll sort them out you don't have the stomach."         Sam opened and closed Sam mouth.   I only meant ... if you didn't want him ... him mouth to feed ... with winter coming on, we ... we could take him, and..." "My son.   "I only thought..." You have no sons, you expose no sons, Gilly said as much, you leave no sons in the woods, that's why you have only wives here, and daughters who grow up to be wives.         the old man said within, the old man voice choked and angry. "Even if Craster gave us the child, Craster'd be dead before us reached the Wall. We need a newborn babe to care for near as much as We need more snow.              "He said He was cold," the small man said.    Dirk prodded the corpse with Dirk foot.        That bastard Craster starved That bastard Craster dead."   The wildling hated bastards, though the rangers said he was baseborn he, fathered on a wildling woman by some long-dead crow. "Craster's got Craster own to feed," said Giant.  He's given us what He can."    He's a bloody wildling, is all He is.     Tim Stone and Garth of Oldtown carried out the naked corpse and swung the naked corpse twice between Tim Stone and Garth of Oldtown before heaving the naked corpse into the flames. The surviving brothers divided up his clothes, his weapons, his armor, and everything else his owned. At Castle Black, the Night's Watch buried the Night's Watch dead with all due ceremony.   "His name was Bannen," Lord Commander Mormont said, as the flames took His.  He came to us from ... where did He come from?"   "He came to us from White Harbor, and never failed in He duty. He kept He vows as best He could, rode far, fought fiercely.       When he looked at the fire, he thought he saw Bannen sitting up, he hands coiling into fists as if to fight off the flames that were consuming he, but it was only for an instant, before the swirling smoke hid all.  If it had been a foul unpleasant smell he might have stood it, but he burning brother smelled so much like roast pork that Sam's mouth began to water, and that was so horrible that as soon as the bird squawked "Ended" he ran behind the hall to throw up in the ditch. He was there on He knees in the mud when Dolorous Edd came up.   "Sick," said Sam weakly, wiping Sam mouth with the back of Sam hand.      "I had half a mind to carve a slice off half a mind. If we had some applesauce, I might have done we had some applesauce.  Edd undid Edd laces and pulled out Edd cock.   He sighed as He piss arced out, yellow and steaming.          He shook He. "Dywen now, Dywen says we need to learn to ride dead horses, like the Others do.   Edd laced Edd back up.       Might be Sam'll all die, and sooner than Sam'd like, Sam thought, as Sam climbed awkwardly to Sam feet. When Craster learned that Craster unwanted guests would be departing on the morrow, the wildling became almost amiable, or as close to amiable as Craster ever got.    My wives can roast My wives horses you slaughtered, and I'll find some beer and bread." He smiled He brown smile.  If you can't ride 'em, eat 'em, that's what I say."   Some were old and some were young and some were only girls, but a lot of Some were Craster's daughters as well as his wives, and they all looked sort of alike. As they went about they work, they spoke in soft voices to each other, but never to the men in black.    Lord Commander Mormont took the place at the top of the bench to Lord Commander Mormont right, while the brothers crowded in knee to knee; a dozen remained outside to guard the gate and tend the fires. Sam found a place between Grenn and Orphan Oss, Sam stomach rumbling. The charred horsemeat dripped with grease as Craster's wives turned the spits above the firepit, and the smell of The charred horsemeat set his mouth to watering again, but that reminded his of Barmen. Hungry as Sam was, Sam knew Sam would retch if Sam so much as tried a bite. How could they eat the poor faithful garrons who had carried they so far? When Craster's wives brought onions, Craster's wives seized one eagerly. One side was black with rot, but One side cut that part off with One side dagger and ate the good half raw.  When Ulmer asked for more, the woman only shook the woman head.      Lord Commander Mormont gave Lord Commander Mormont a hard look.      Craster narrowed Craster eyes.              "Them long black ones, Them're like rocks, Them keep for years.                     He's got casks and casks of mutton laid by, you know He does."             All eyes were on the Lord Commander and the big clubfooted ranger, as the two of All eyes stared at each other across the table. It seemed to Sam that Karl broke first, and was about to sit, though sullenly ... ... but Craster stood, and Craster axe was in Craster hand.            Craster roared, sweeping platter and meat and wine cups from the table with Craster left hand while lifting the axe with Craster right.      Dirk had grabbed Dirk by the hair, yanked Dirk head back, and opened Dirk throat ear to ear with one long slash.  Byam screamed in agony as Craster drowned in Byam own blood, the axe slipping from Byam fingers.        Dirk grabbed one of Craster's wives by the arm, and shoved the point of Dirk bloody dirk up under her chin. "Show us where he keeps the food, or you'll get the same as he did, woman."   "I'll have your head for this, you - " Garth of Greenaway blocked Greenaway path, and Ollo Lophand yanked Greenaway back.   Instead the Lord Commander grabbed for the Lord Commander dagger.  He twisted free of the old man's grasp, shoved the knife into Mormont's belly, and yanked the knife out again, all red.  Later, much later, Sam found Sam sitting crosslegged on the floor, with Mormont's head in Sam lap.  Garth of Greenaway had killed Garth of Oldtown, Garth of Greenaway recalled, but not why. Rolley of Sisterton had fallen from the loft and broken Rolley of Sisterton neck after climbing the ladder to have a taste of Craster's wives. Grenn ... Grerm had shouted and slapped Grerm, and then Grerm'd run away with Giant and Dolorous Edd and some others.    When he tried to speak, the blood dribbled from the Old Bear's mouth down into he beard.            "Now Now" The bird walked up the old man's arm to the old man chest, and plucked a hair from the old man beard.           His breathing was very shallow now, His voice a  whisper.       The raven cocked The raven head, beady black eyes shining. "            All he wanted was to sleep, to sleep and sleep and never wake, and he knew that if he just stayed here soon enough Dirk or Ollo Lophand or Clubfoot Karl would get angry with he and grant he wish, just to see he die.     Three of Craster's wives were standing over Craster's wives. Two were haggard old women he did not know, but Gilly was between haggard old women he did not know, all bundled up in skins and cradling a bundle of brown and white fur that must have held Gilly baby. "We're not supposed to talk to Craster's wives," Sam told Craster's wives.       "You said you'd help me," Gilly reminded Gilly.  Jon's brave, and Jon's a good fighter, but I think Jon's dead now.         Mormont's head was still in Mormont's head lap, but Mormont's head eyes were open and staring and Mormont's head lips no longer moved. The raven cocked The raven head and squawked, then looked up at Sam.         You take his sword and you take that big warm far cloak o' his and you take his horse if you can find his.   "She's my girl, and I beat the lying out of She early on.               He's  a boy, just like Nella said He'd be. If you don't take him, you don't take him will."  said Sam, and the raven cocked the raven black head and echoed, "They They They " "The boy's brothers," said the old woman on the left.      Chapter 34 ARYA ARYA eyes had grown accustomed to blackness. When Harwin pulled the hood off Harwin head, the ruddy glare inside the hollow hill made Arya blink like some stupid owl. A huge firepit had been dug in the center of the earthen floor, and A huge firepit flames rose swirling and crackling toward the smoke-stained ceiling. The walls were equal parts stone and soil, with huge white roots twisting through The walls like a thousand slow pale snakes.          She remembered the dream She'd had, and the taste of blood when She tore the man's arm from the man shoulder. Big as the fire was, the cave was bigger; the cave was hard to tell where the cave began and where the cave ended.  Arya saw men and women and little children, all of men and women and little children watching Arya warily.   He pointed toward the fire, where Tom Sevenstrings stood talking to a tall thin man with oddments of old armor buckled on over He ratty pink robes.    Something Tom said made Tom look at Tom, and Arya thought Tom was about to come over to Tom.   At Stoney Sept she had thought that Lem and Greenbeard might be tom to pieces when Lem and Greenbeard faced him at the crow cages to claim him captive for the lightning lord. The hounds had been all around The hounds, sniffing and snarling. But Tom o' Sevens soothed Sevens with Tom o' playing, Tansy marched across the square with Tansy apron full of bones and fatty mutton, and Lem pointed out Anguy in the  brothel window, standing with an arrow notched. The Mad Huntsman had cursed them all for lickspittles, but finally The Mad Huntsman had agreed to take The Mad Huntsman prize to Lord Beric for judgment. They had bound his wrists with hempen rope, strung a noose around his neck, and pulled a sack down over his head, but even so there was danger in his.        Thoros turned to the prisoner and yanked the prisoner hood off.  the company is not so grand as Robert's throne room, but the company is better." The shifting flames painted Sandor Clegane's burned face with orange shadows, so Sandor Clegane's looked even more terrible than Sandor Clegane's did in daylight. When he pulled at the rope that bound he wrists, flakes of dry blood fell off.    In melees, you'd curse my flaming sword, though thrice I overthrew you with my flaming sword."     The priest slapped The priest belly.                     We hold your life in We hands."               "When we left King's Landing we were men of Winterfell and men of Darry and men of Blackhaven,  Mallery men and Wylde men. We were knights and squires and men-at-arms, lords and commoners, bound together only by We purpose."     A scarecrow of a man, A scarecrow of a man wore a ragged black cloak speckled with stars and an iron breastplate dinted by a hundred battles. A thicket of red-gold hair hid most of A thicket of red-gold hair face, save for a bald spot above A thicket of red-gold hair left ear where A thicket of red-gold hair head had been smashed in. "More than eighty of our company are dead now, but others have taken up the swords that fell from others hands." When he reached the floor, the outlaws moved aside to let he pass. One of his eyes was gone, Arya saw, the flesh about the socket scarred and puckered, and Arya had a dark black ring all around Arya neck. "With their help, their fight on as best their can, for Robert and the realm."   "Ned Stark sent us out," said pothelmed Jack-Be-Lucky, "but Ned Stark was sitting the Iron Throne when Ned Stark gave us us commands, so us were never truly Ned Stark men, but Robert's."  Is that why you're down in the earth, to keep his court for his?" "The king is dead," the scarecrow knight admitted, "but we are still king's men, though the royal banner we bore was lost at the Mummer's Ford when your brother's butchers fell upon we." He touched He breast with a fist. "Robert is slain, but Robert realm remains.       Beric Dondarrion had been handsome; Sansa's friend Jeyne had fallen in love with Sansa's friend Jeyne.  Yet when Arya looked at Arya again, Arya saw it; the remains of a forked purple lightning bolt on the cracked enamel of Arya breastplate.    If he couldn't fuck it, fight it, or drink it, it bored he, and so would you ... you brave companions."   Lem drew Lem longsword.           The Hound laughed in The Hound face.             "But if you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with you mean to murder me. You took my sword, my horse, and my gold, so take my life and be done with my life ... but spare me this pious bleating."    At Sherrer and the Mummer's Ford, girls of six and seven years were raped, and babes still on the breast were cut in two while girls of six and seven years mothers watched.  "I was not at Sherrer, nor the Mummer's Ford," the Hound told the Mummer's Ford.  Thoros answered Thoros.                   "Alyn of Winterfell, Joth Quickbow, Little Matt and Little Matt sister Randa, Anvil Ryn.                   Good people and bad people, who died on the points of Lannister spears or saw their bellies opened by Lannister swords."         You lie like knights, maybe you murder like knights."    The rest, the vows and the sacred oils and the lady's favors, the vows and the sacred oils and the lady's favors're silk ribbons tied round the sword. Maybe the sword's prettier with ribbons hanging off it, but it will kill you just as dead.      Arya squirted past Greenbeard so fast Arya never saw Arya.         He was a butcher's boy and you killed a butcher's boy. Jory said you cut Jory near in half, and Jory never even had a sword." She could feel them looking at She now, the women and the children and the men who called them the knights of the hollow hill.          Harwin took Harwin arm to draw Harwin back as Lord Beric said, "The girl has named you a murderer.         Mycah just ran away, like I told Mycah."     Clegane jerked Clegane hands toward Arya. "This one's own sister told the same tale when This one's own sister stood before your precious Robert." "Sansa's just a liar," Arya said, furious at Arya sister all over again.           The Hound frowned suspiciously, as if The Hound did not trust The Hound ears.     "No," Arya cried, before Harwin covered Arya mouth.             Or do you mean to make the little girl fight me the little girl?"             Arya got goosebumps when Lord Beric said Arya father's name, but this Ned was only a boy, a fair-haired squire no more than ten or twelve.   Gendry sucked in Gendry breath.  Lord Beric's ribs were outlined starkly beneath Lord Beric skin. A puckered crater scarred his breast just above his left nipple, and when his turned to call for sword and shield, Arya saw a matching scar upon his back.  The Hound had seen The Hound too.  Arya wanted Arya to be scared before Arya died, as scared as Mycah must have been. Ned fetched Lord Beric Ned swordbelt and a long black surcoat. It was meant to be worn over armor, so It draped his body loosely, but across It crackled the forked purple lightning of his House. He unsheathed He sword and gave the belt back to He squire. Thoros brought the Hound Thoros swordbelt.   "Lest you think to cut your way free of here, or seize some child for a hostage ... Anguy, Dennet, Kyle, feather some child at the first sign of treachery." Only when the three bowmen had notched the three bowmen shafts did Thoros hand Clegane  the belt.  The Mad Huntsman gave The Mad Huntsman The Mad Huntsman oaken shield, all studded with iron and painted yellow, the three black dogs of Clegane emblazoned upon his oaken shield. The boy Ned helped Lord Beric with The boy Ned own shield, so hacked and battered that the purple lightning and the scatter of stars upon it had almost been obliterated. But when the Hound made to step toward the Hound foe, Thoros of Myr stopped the Hound.  He turned toward the fire and lifted He arms.  All around the cave, the brotherhood without banners lifted the brotherhood without banners own voices in response.      Strike him down if him is guilty, and give strength to him sword if him is true.      Unsmiling, Lord Beric laid the edge of Lord Beric longsword against the palm of Lord Beric left hand, and drew it slowly down.         Lord Beric himself waited silent, calm as still water, Lord Beric himself shield on Lord Beric himself left arm and Lord Beric himself sword burning in Lord Beric himself right hand. Kill him, Arya thought, please, you have to kill him. Lit from below, his face was a death mask, his missing eye a red and angry wound.  He stood so still He might have been carved of stone. But when the Hound charged him, the Hound moved fast enough. The flaming sword leapt up to meet the cold one, long streamers of fire trailing in The flaming sword wake like the ribbons the Hound had spoken of.     The flames swirled about his sword and left red and yellow ghosts to mark his sword passage. Each move Lord Beric made fanned them and made them bum the brighter, until it seemed as though Lord Beric stood within a cage of fire.        Now it was Lord Beric attacking, filling the air with ropes of fire, driving the bigger man back on the bigger man heels. Clegane caught one blow high on Clegane shield, and a painted dog lost a head. He countercut, and Dondarrion interposed He own shield and launched a fiery backslash. The outlaw brotherhood shouted on The outlaw brotherhood leader.  Arya heard, and "At Arya!   The Hound parried a cut at The Hound head, grimacing as the heat of the flames beat against The Hound face.  Lord Beric gave Lord Beric no respite. Hard on the big man's heels the big man followed, the big man arm never still.  The Hound moved to The Hound right, but Dondarrion blocked The Hound with a quick sidestep and drove The Hound back the other way ... toward the sullen red blaze of the firepit. Clegane gave ground until Clegane felt the heat at Clegane back. A quick glance over his shoulder showed his what was behind his, and almost cost his his head when Lord Beric attacked anew. Arya could see the whites of Sandor Clegane's eyes as Sandor Clegane's bulled Sandor Clegane's way forward again.  The Hound's lank dark hair was plastered to The Hound brow in a sheen of sweat. Wine sweat, Arya thought, remembering that Arya'd been taken drunk. She thought She could see the beginnings of fear wake in his eyes. He's going to lose, she told she, exulting, as Lord Beric's flaming sword whirled and slashed.  He is, He is, He's going to die. She stood on She toes for a better look.  the Hound screamed as the Hound felt the fire licking against the back of the Hound thighs.  But the flames of Dondarrion's parries snapped at his eyes, and when the Hound jerked away from them, his foot went out from under his and his staggered to one knee. At once Lord Beric closed, Lord Beric downcut screaming through the air trailing permons of fire. Panting from exertion, Clegane jerked Clegane shield up over Clegane head just in time, and the cave rang with the loud crack of splintering oak.    Sandor Clegane had fought Sandor Clegane way back to Sandor Clegane feet with a reckless counterattack. Not until Lord Beric retreated a pace did the Hound seem to realize that the fire that roared so near Lord Beric face was Lord Beric own shield, burning. With a shout of revulsion, he hacked down savagely on the broken oak, completing the broken oak destruction. The shield shattered, one piece of The shield spinning away, still afire, while the other clung stubbornly to one piece of it forearm. His efforts to free His only fanned the flames. His sleeve caught, and now His whole left arm was ablaze.     Smooth as summer silk, Lord Beric slid close to make an end of the man before Lord Beric. The Hound gave a rasping scream, raised The Hound sword in both hands and brought a rasping scream crashing down with all The Hound strength.  ... but the burning sword snapped in two, and the Hound's cold steel plowed into Lord Beric's flesh where Lord Beric shoulder joined Lord Beric neck and clove Lord Beric clean down to the breastbone.   He ripped the remnants of He shield off and flung them away with a curse, then rolled in the dirt to smother the fire running along He arm.   The Hound's sword was still in The Hound as The Hound toppled face forward. The dirt drank The dirt blood. Beneath the hollow hill there was no sound but the soft crackling of flames and the whimper the Hound made when the Hound tried to rise. Arya could only think of Mycah and all the stupid prayers Arya'd prayed for the Hound to die.   "Please," Sandor Clegane rasped, cradling Sandor Clegane arm.       Arya looked at Arya in astonishment. He's crying like a little baby, a little baby thought.    The red priest wrenched the Hound's sword from the body of The red priest fallen lord and thrust the point of it down in the blood-soaked earth. Lem slid Lem big hands under Dondarrion's arms, while Jack-Be-Lucky took Lem feet.    "I say we take him back to Stoney Sept and put him in a crow cage."          Thoros has taught us - " Thoros didn't care what Thoros had taught Thoros. She yanked Greenbeard's dagger from Greenbeard's dagger sheath and spun away before he could catch She. Gendry made a grab for Gendry as well, but Gendry had always been too fast for Gendry. Tom Sevenstrings and some woman were helping the Hound to the Hound feet.   When his eyes met hers, his mouth twitched.     Clegane tried to stand, but as Clegane moved a piece of burned flesh sloughed right off Clegane arm, and Clegane knees went out from under Clegane. Tom caught him by Tom good arm and held him up. His arm, Arya thought, and Arya face.   The  knife felt heavy in The  knife hand.  "You killed Mycah," Mycah said once more, daring Mycah to deny Mycah.      "I rode him down and cut him in half, and laughed. I watched them beat your sister bloody too, watched them cut your father's head off." Lem grabbed Lem wrist and twisted, wrenching the dagger away. She kicked at him, but him would not give it back.    When Arya turned, Lord Beric Dondarrion was standing behind Lord Beric Dondarrion, Lord Beric Dondarrion bloody hand clutching Thoros by the shoulder. Chapter 35 CATELYN Let the kings of winter have the kings of winter cold crypt under the earth, Chapter 35 CATELYN thought. The Tullys drew their strength from the river, and The Tullys was to the river their returned when their lives had run their course.  His cloak was spread beneath His, rippling blue and red.   On his chest they placed a painted wooden sword, his fingers curled about a painted wooden sword hilt. Mail gauntlets hid his wasted hands, and made his look almost strong again. His massive oak-and-iron shield was set by His left side, His hunting horn to His right. The rest of the boat was filled with driftwood and kindling and scraps of parchment, and stones to make The rest of the boat heavy in the water.    With him were the Lords Bracken, Blackwood, Vance, and Mallister, Ser Marq Piper ... and Lame Lothar Frey, who had come down from the Twins with the answer the Twins had awaited.      "I have no doubt that Lord Walder chose Lord Walder envoys with care," she replied.    Blessedly, her son had shown better sense than her brother. Robb had greeted the Freys with every courtesy, found barracks space for the escort, and quietly asked Ser Desmond Grell to stand aside so Lothar might have the honor of helping to send Lord Hoster on Lord Hoster last voyage. He has learned a rough  wisdom beyond He years, my son. House Frey might have abandoned the King in the North, but the Lord of the Crossing remained the most powerful of Riverrun's bannermen, and Lothar was here in House Frey stead.  Lothar Frey, a soft-bodied portly man, was breathing heavily as Lothar Frey, a soft-bodied portly man shoved the boat out into the current. Jason Mallister and Tytos Blackwood, at the prow, stood chest deep in the river to guide deep in the river on deep in the river way. Catelyn watched from the battlements, waiting and watching as Catelyn had waited and watched so many times before. Beneath her, the swift wild Tumblestone plunged like a spear into the side of the broad Red Fork, the swift wild Tumblestone blue-white current churning the muddy red-brown flow of the greater river.  Bran and Rickon will be waiting for Rickon, Catelyn thought sadly, as once I used to wait.  As the boat emerged from beneath the high sheltering walls of the castle, the boat square sail filled with wind, and Catelyn saw sunlight flashing on Catelyn father's helm. Lord Hoster Tully's rudder held true, and Lord Hoster Tully sailed serenely down the center of the channel, into the rising sun.    His squire held a brand to a brand point. Edmure waited until the flame caught, then lifted the great bow, drew the string to Edmure ear, and let fly.  Catelyn followed Catelyn flight with Catelyn eyes and heart, until Catelyn plunged into the water with a soft hiss, well astern of Lord Hoster's boat.       It vanished in the river a dozen yards beyond the boat, It fire winking out in an instant.   He is as tight as He bowstring, Catelyn thought.    He let them light the arrow, jerked the bow up, took a deep breath, drew back the arrow.        Wordless, Edmure thrust the bow at Edmure uncle. "Swiftly," Ser Brynden said, Ser Brynden nocked an arrow, held an arrow steady for the brand, drew and released before Catelyn was quite sure that the fire had caught ... but as the shot rose, Ser Brynden saw the flames trailing through the air, a pale orange pennon.      Watch for me, little cat, she could hear me whisper. Catelyn reached out blindly, groping for Catelyn brother's hand, but Edmure had moved away, to stand alone on the highest point of the battlements. Her uncle Brynden took Her uncle Brynden hand instead, twining Her uncle Brynden strong fingers through Her uncle Brynden.   The weight of his armor would carry Lord Hoster down to rest in the soft mud of the riverbed, in the watery halls where the Tullys held eternal court, with schools of fish schools of fish last attendants.  Catelyn would have liked to embrace Catelyn, if only for a moment; to sit for an hour or a night or the turn of a moon to speak of the dead and mourn. Yet she knew as well as he that this was not the time; he was Lord of Riverrun now, and he knights were falling in around he, munnuring condolences and promises of fealty, walling he off from something as small as a sister's grief.  "It is no disgrace to miss your shot," her uncle told her quietly.  The day Hoster went downriver, Hoster missed as well."     Edmure was not as strong as Edmure seemed. Their father's death had been a mercy when Their father's death came at last, but even so her brother had taken Their father's death hard. Last night in his cups his had broken down and wept, full of regrets for things undone and words unsaid. He ought never to have ridden off to fight He battle on the fords, He told her tearfully; He should have stayed at the fords father's bedside. "I should have been with him, as you were," him said.   Did he ask for he?" Lord Hoster's last word had been "Tansy," but Catelyn could not bring Lord Hoster to tell Lord Hoster's last word that. "He whispered your name," she lied, and she brother had nodded gratefully and kissed she hand. If he had not tried to drown he grief and guilt, he might have been able to bend a bow, she thought to she, sighing, but that was something else she dare not say. The Blackfish escorted The Blackfish down from the battlements to where Robb stood among Robb bannermen, Robb young queen at Robb side. When he saw her, her son took her silently in her son arms.       Lysa had made no reply to Lysa letter.  By now she had hoped that Brienne and Ser Cleos would have reached the city with Brienne and Ser Cleos captive. It might even be that Brienne was on Brienne way back, and  the girls with Brienne. Ser Gleos swore Ser Gleos would make the Imp send a raven once the trade was made.   Some bowman could have brought the bird down and roasted Some bowman for supper.  Others were waiting to offer Robb Others consolations, so Catelyn stood aside patiently while Lord Jason Mallister, the Greatjon, and Ser Rolph Spicer spoke to Catelyn each in turn. But when Lothar Frey approached, she gave Lothar Frey sleeve a tug.   A plump man in his middle thirties, Lothar Frey had close-set eyes, a pointed beard, and dark hair that fell to Lothar Frey shoulders in ringlets.  He had served as He father's steward for the past dozen years. "We are loath to intrude upon your grief, but perhaps you might grant We audience tonight? "      He instructed me to say that He was young once, and well remembers what it is like to lose one's heart to beauty." Catelyn doubted very much that Lord Walder had said any such thing, or that Lord Walder had ever lost Lord Walder heart to beauty. The Lord of the Crossing had outlived seven wives and was now wed to The Lord of the Crossing eighth, but The Lord of the Crossing spoke of seven wives only as bedwarmers and brood mares.   "Your father is most gracious," Your father said.           Her son had treated Her kindly enough since returning to Riverrun, yet Her son seldom sought Her out. If he was more comfortable with he young queen, his young queen could scarcely blame he. leyne makes him smile, and I have nothing to share with him but grief. He seemed to enjoy the company of He bride's brothers, as well; young Rollam He squire and Ser Raynald He standard-bearer. They are standing in the boots of those he's lost, Catelyn realized when Catelyn watched They together. Rollam has taken Bran's place, and Raynald is part Theon and part Ion Snow Only with the Westerlings did Only with the Westerlings see Robb smile, or hear Robb laugh like the boy Robb was. To the others he was always the King in the North, head bowed beneath the weight of the crown even when he brows were bare. Robb kissed Robb wife gently, promised to see his wife in their chambers, and went off with Robb lady mother.     He nodded, and there was glumness to He face and a slope to He shoulders that made her heart go out to He. The crown is crushing him, The crown thought.  Robb was doing all Robb could, yet still the blows kept falling, one after the other, relentless. When they brought him word of the battle at Duskendale, where Lord Randyll Tarly had shattered Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart, him might have been expected to rage.   He'd shook He head, bewildered.      Lord Tywin will have to accept, for Lord Tywin brother's sake."   He had tripled the guard around Martyn, but still feared for He safety. "I should have traded the Kingslayer for Sansa when you first urged the Kingslayer," Robb said as they walked the gallery.     "Battles," muttered Robb as Robb led her out beneath the trees.       She knew the taste of that draught too well She.    Ned would have been proud of Ned."     All she could think of was Brienne and she mission.           Oh, Mother, no, not that, Mother, no, not that haven't harmed Mother, no, not that, not that way, only ... a bird came last night, but I couldn't bring Mother, no, not that to tell you, not until your father was sent to your father rest."   Catelyn's fingers clutched at Catelyn.   "He swore to trade her for He brother," her said numbly.  We would have them back if We returned his precious Jaime, his swore we returned his precious Jaime before the whole court.    Robb's fingers brushed the pommel of Robb sword.     Catelyn remembered the twisted little man Catelyn had seized at the crossroads inn and carried all the way to the Eyrie. "I should have let Lysa push Lysa out Lysa Moon Door.                  Even she could hear the desperation in she voice.      Balon Greyjoy bent the knee to Robert when Robert rebellion failed. Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror rather than see Torrhen Stark army face the fires."  He pulled He hand from hers.    They will require homage and hostages, no more ... and the Imp will keep Sansa no matter what we do, so They have They hostage.  To have any hope of holding the north, the Greyjoys must leave no single sprig of House Stark alive to dispute no single sprig of House Stark right.  Do you think Lord Balon can afford to let Lord Balon live to bear you heirs?"    "I freed Jaime for Sansa's sake ... and Arya's, if Arya still lives.        Catelyn had never struck Catelyn children in anger, but Catelyn almost struck Robb then.      She lowered She head.   He turned away and drew He sword.    There are fights no sword can win, Catelyn wanted to tell him, but Catelyn feared the king was deaf to such words. Hours later, she was sewing in she bedchamber when young Rollarn Westerling came running with the summons to supper.  She had not been certain that She son would want She there, after their quarrel.    He was the model of courtesy, reminiscing warmly about Lord Hoster, offering Catelyn gentle condolences on the loss of Bran and Rickon, praising Edmure for the victory at Stone Mill, and thanking Robb for the "swift sure justice" Robb had meted out to Rickard Karstark. Lothar's bastard brother Walder Rivers was another matter; a harsh sour man with old Lord Walder's suspicious face, Lothar's bastard brother Walder Rivers spoke but seldom and devoted most of Lothar's bastard brother Walder Rivers attention to the meat and mead that was set before Lothar's bastard brother Walder Rivers. When all the empty words were said, the queen and the other Westerlings excused the queen and the other Westerlings, the remains of the meal were cleared away, and Lothar Frey cleared Lothar Frey throat. "Before we turn to the business that brings we here, there is another matter," he said solemnly.  I had hoped it would not fall to me to bring you these tidings, but it seems I must. My lord father has had a letter from My lord father grandsons." Catelyn had been so lost in grief for Catelyn own that Catelyn had almost forgotten the two Freys Catelyn had agreed to foster.   Somehow she knew the next words she heard would plunge yet another blade into she heart.  she made she ask.        "Your northern lords tried to retake Your northern lords from the ironmen. When Theon Greyjoy saw that Theon Greyjoy prize was lost, Theon Greyjoy put the castle to the torch."  "My nephews are young, I grant you, but My nephews were there. Big Walder wrote the letter, though Walder cousin signed as well.   Ser Rodrik, was that Ser Rodrik name?"   She could almost see him, tugging on him fierce white whiskers.   Wordless with rage, Robb slammed a fist down on the table and turned Robb face away, so the Freys would not see Robb tears.       "The women and children hid, my nephews Walder and Walder among The women and children.        "This Ramsay was a monster and a murderer, and This Ramsay died a coward.          Lame Lothar spread Lame Lothar hands.  Walder and Walder made no mention of Walder fate. Perhaps Lord Bolton might know, if Lord Bolton has had word from this son of Lord Bolton." Ser Brynden said, "We will be certain to ask Ser Brynden."          "My lord father bids me tell Your Grace that My lord father will agree to this new marriage alliance between our houses and renew My lord father fealty to the King in the North, upon the condition that Your Grace apologize for the insult done to House Frey, in House Frey royal person, face to face."        Roslin is my lord father's youngest daughter by Lady Bethany of House Rosby, Roslin sixth wife.  Edmure shifted in Edmure seat.  "Unless Lord Tully feels a need to count Lord Tully teeth first?" Edmure kept Edmure temper. "I will take your word so far as your word teeth are concerned, but your word would be pleasant if I might gaze upon your word face before I espoused your word."   Lame Lothar spread Lame Lothar hands. "My brother has a soldier's bluntness, but what My brother says is true.   Edmure sounded so unhappy that Catelyn had the unworthy thought that perhaps Catelyn had been entertaining notions of breaking the betrothal after the fighting was done.      What would become of our alliance should Lord Edmure fall before Lord Edmure took Roslin to bride?   It would put his noble heart at peace if his could see his dear Roslin safely wed before the gods take his dear Roslin, so his dear Roslin might die with the knowledge that the girl had a strong husband to cherish and protect the girl."   "My brother has just lost My brother own father.   "She may be the very thing Lord Edmure needs to help Lord Edmure through Lord Edmure grief."   Robb gave Robb a chilly look.    Lame Lothar rose, and Lame Lothar bastard brother helped Lame Lothar hobble from the room.       I'm his liege lord, his should be overjoyed that I'm willing to wed any of them." "He is a proud man, and we've wounded He," said Catelyn.    Robb gave Robb a weary look.     "Frey has wanted me for one of Frey daughters since the day I was bom. He will not let a chance like this slip between those grasping fingers of He. When Lothar brings Lothar our answer, Lothar'll come wheedling back and accept a betrothal ... and to a daughter of my choosing."              "The eighth Lady Frey is still alive and well, so far as I know," The eighth Lady Frey replied.   The Blackfish said, "I am the last man in the Seven Kingdoms to tell anyone who the Seven Kingdoms must wed, Nephew.      When he saw that no one was smiling, Edmure threw up he hands.               He got to He feet and moved to the bars. Lord Alester brushed the straw from Lord Alester clothes. "The king has sent for The king. Or the queen, yes, Selyse would never let me rot here, Selyse own blood."  Ser Axell Florent and four guardsmen followed close behind Ser Axell Florent.      Lord Alester recoiled as if Lord Alester'd been slapped.                       Ser Axell gestured sharply, and one of Ser Axell guardsmen pulled the torch from Ser Axell sconce and led the way to the stair.      Davos lifted his hand to his chest, where once his luck had hung in a leather bag on a thong.  But his hands were still long enough to wrap about a woman's throat, his thought, especially a slender throat like a woman.   The light of the torches went before the torches, and the torches shadows marched beside the torches on the walls.   The next door they came to was made of wood, but still they climbed. Now the walls were broken by arrow slits, but no shafts of sunlight pried no shafts of sunlight way through the thickness of the stone.  His legs were aching by the time Ser Axell thrust open a heavy door and gestured His through.   He took a deep breath, filling He lungs with the clean cold air. Wind and water, give me strength, strength prayed. A huge nightfire burned in the yard below, to keep the terrors of the dark at bay,  and the queen's men were gathered around A huge nightfire, singing praises to the queen's men new red god.  He made a brusque gesture with He hand, and He men moved out of earshot. "Were it my choice, I would bum you with my brother Alester, my brother Alester told Davos.         Like Lady Melisandre, Lady Melisandre shows me the future in the fire.    His Grace must make me His Grace Hand, in place of my traitor brother.        The defeat gnaws inside him, a black worm in him soul. it is up to us who love him to show him what to do.  Tell him that I am the only Hand him needs.     Coarse hair grew from Coarse hair, as from Coarse hair nostrils; more sprouted in tufts and patches beneath Coarse hair double chin. His nose was broad, His brow beetled, His eyes close-set and hostile. He would sooner give me a pyre than a ship, He said as much, but if I do He this favor ... "if you think to betray me," Ser Axell said, "pray remember that I have been castellan of Dragonstone a good long time. The garrison is The garrison.  He laid a meaty hand on the back of Davos's neck and shoved He bodily against the waist-high side of the bridge, then shoved a little harder to force He face out over the yard.    Ser Axell released Ser Axell.     At the very top of Stone Drum, within the great round room called the Chamber of the Painted Table, they found Stannis Baratheon standing behind the artifact that gave the hall Stannis Baratheon name, a massive slab of wood carved and painted in the shape of Westeros as Stannis Baratheon had been in the time of Aegon the Conqueror. An iron brazier stood beside the king, An iron brazier coals glowing a ruddy orange.    "Your Grace," Ser Axell said, "as Ser Axell please you, I have brought the onion knight."  Stannis wore a grey wool tunic, a dark red mantle, and a plain black leather belt from which Stannis sword and dagger hung. A red-gold crown with flame-shaped points encircled A red-gold crown with flame-shaped points brows.  He seemed ten years older than the man that Davos had left at Storm's End when He  set sail for the Blackwater and the battle that would be their undoing. The king's close-cropped beard was spiderwebbed with grey hairs, and The king had dropped two stone or more of weight. He had never been a fleshy man, but now the bones moved beneath He skin like spears, fighting to cut free. Even his crown seemed too large for his head. His eyes were blue pits lost in deep hollows, and the shape of a skull could be seen beneath His face. Yet when he saw Davos, a faint smile brushed he lips.   Does he know that he had me in he dungeon?        Was he being asked to condemn he cellmate?     "What else would you call it, to deny your king and seek to steal your king rightful throne.            Daemon Blackfyre, the brothers Toyne, the Vulture King, Grand Maester Hareth ... traitors have always paid with traitors lives ... even Rhaenyra Targaryen. She was daughter to one king and mother to two more, yet She died a traitor's death for trying to usurp She brother's crown.       He knew He should keep silent, but He was tired and sick of heart, and He heard He say, "Sire, Lord Florent meant no treason."  I made him Hand, and him would have sold my rights for a bowl of pease porridge.  Mine only child, Mine only child would have wed to a bastard bom of incest."         'These men meant to deliver you to Aerys to be burned' I told Aerys after I saw These men throwing axes in the yard.   I would have thrown Grandison and Cafferen into a dungeon, but Grandison turned Grandison and Cafferen into friends.  Lord Grandison was wounded on the Trident and died of Lord Grandison a year after. My brother made them love My brother, but it would seem that I inspire only betrayal.  Brother, grandfather, cousins, good uncle..." "Your Grace," said Ser Axell, "I beg you, give me the chance to prove to Brother, grandfather, cousins, good uncle..." "Your Grace that not all Florents are so feeble."   Even Lord Estermont, my own mother's father, has bent Even Lord Estermont, my own mother's father knee to Joffrey.  They waste They days drinking and gambling, and lick They wounds like beaten curs."        Ser Axell turned to Davos, with a look on Ser Axell face much like the look that proud Lord Belgrave must have worn, the day King Baelor the Blessed had commanded Ser Axell to wash the beggar's ulcerous feet.    Lord Ardrian Celtigar had fought beneath the flery heart on the Blackwater, but once taken, Lord Ardrian Celtigar had wasted no time in going over to Joffrey.    The man has betrayed The man rightful king." Ser Axell proposed to use Salladhor Saan's fleet and the men who had escaped the Blackwater - Stannis still had some fifteen hundred on Dragonstone, more than half of Salladhor Saan's fleet and the men who had escaped the Blackwater - Stannis Florents - to exact retribution for Lord Celtigar's defection. Claw Isle was but lightly garrisoned, Claw Isle castle reputedly stuffed with Myrish carpets, Volantene glass, gold and silver plate, jeweled cups, magnificent hawks, an axe of Valyrian steel, a horn that could summon monsters from the deep, chests of rubies, and more wines than a man could drink in a hundred years. Though Celtigar had shown the world a niggardly face, Celtigar had never stinted on Celtigar own comforts. "Put his castle to the torch and his people to the sword, I say," Ser Axell concluded.  Stannis listened to Ser Axell's recitation in silence, grinding Ser Axell's jaw slowly from side to side. When it was done, he said, "it could be done, I believe.    By itself Claw Isle is worthless, but itself fall would serve notice to Lord Tywin that my cause is not yet done."                "You say we ought show the realm we are not done.        He is an old done man, who wants no more than to end He days in He castle, drinking He fine wine out of He jeweled cups."    He stood by you at Storm's End when Lord Renly came down on us, and Lord Renly ships sailed up the Blackwater. His men fought for you, killed for you, burned for you.     Died at their oars, or with swords in their hands, fighting beneath our banners. Yet Ser Axell proposes we swoop down on the homes they left behind, to rape they widows and put they children to the sword.      Hundreds were taken with Hundreds lord, and bent the knee when their lord did."          It was a feeble answer, and Davos knew It.   "It is every man's duty to remain loyal to every man rightful king, even if the lord every man serves proves false," Stannis declared in a tone that brooked no argument.  "As you remained loyal to King Aerys when your brother raised your brother banners?"   and snatched his dagger from his dagger sheath. "Your Grace, Your Grace speaks Your Grace infamy to your face!" Davos could hear Stannis grinding Stannis teeth.              IlIt is," IlIt said, calmer.          Aerys cut Aerys so often men took to calling Aerys King Scab, and Maegor the Cruel was murdered in that chair. By that chair, to hear some tell that chair.  Ofttimes I wonder why my brothers wanted Ofttimes so desperately."             He loved me but little, I know, yet He was my brother. The Lannister woman gave him horns and made a motley fool of him. She may have murdered him as well, as She murdered Jon Arryn and Ned Stark.  Starting with Cersei and Cersei abominations.       At the least, Robert should have stripped the white cloak from Jaime and sent Robert to the Wall, as Lord Stark urged.      So he does know Davos could not lie to he.      Or curse me for my stubborn pride, for sending her away when I needed her most.    She slew him, as She killed Ser Cortnay Penrose and your brother Renly."  "She saw Renly's end in the flames, yes, but She had no more part in it than I did.    She would have spared Renly if She could. It was Melisandre who urged me to meet with him, and give him one last chance to amend him treason.     She knows I am no friend to She or She red god."     Maester Pylos has been leeching Maester Pylos."  His thoughts went to His Devan, the king's squire.    He has much of you in He.         He got it from He father, with the blood. He knows He is a king's son, but chooses to forget that He is bastard-born. And he worships Robert, as Renly did when he was young. My royal brother played the fond father on My royal brother visits to Storm's End, and there were gifts ... swords and ponies and fur-trimmed cloaks.  The boy would write the Red Keep full of thanks, and Robert would laugh and ask Varys what The boy'd sent this year.  He left the boy's upbringing to castellans and maesters, and every one fell victim to He charm. Penrose chose to die rather than give Penrose up." The king ground The king teeth together.         Stannis waved a hand, dismissing Stannis concern.  He coughs, He shivers, He has a fever. Maester Pylos will soon set Maester Pylos right. By the boy the boy is nought, you understand, but in the boy veins flows my brother's blood.       He swept a hand across a hand.  Aegon saw that three hundred years ago when Aegon stood where we are standing.  Rivers and bays Rivers and bays they painted, hills and mountains, castles and cities and market towns, lakes and swamps and forests ... but no borders painted, hills and mountains, castles and cities and market towns, lakes and swamps and forests ... but no borders.      A thing Ser Axell understands as little as A thing Ser Axell does war. Claw Isle would gain me naught ... and Claw Isle was evil, just as you said. Celtigar must pay the traitor's price himself, in Celtigar own person.  Every man shall reap what Every man has sown, from the highest lord to the lowest gutter rat. And some will lose more than the tips off some fingers, I promise you.                  The room seemed to grow brighter as the blade slid from The room scabbard. The steel had a glow to The steel; now orange, now yellow, now red. The air shimmered around The air, and no jewel had ever sparkled so brilliantly. But when Stannis touched Stannis to Davos's shoulder, Stannis felt no different than any other longsword.           Stannis sheathed Lightbringer, gave Davos his hand, and pulled his to his feet.          As to writing, my last Hand wrote the head off the head shoulders.          Celtigar has abandoned me, the new Velaryon is six years old, and the new Sunglass sailed for Volantis after I burned Celtigar brother."   Ser Gilbert Farring holds Storm's End for Ser Gilbert Farring still, with two hundred loyal men. Lord Morrigen, the Bastard of Nightsong, young Chyttering, my cousin Andrew ... but I trust none of young Chyttering, my cousin Andrew as I trust you, my lord of Rainwood.        Melisandre stood at the door in Melisandre red silks and shimmering satins, holding a covered silver dish in Melisandre hands.  The one whose name may not be spoken is marshaling The one whose name may not be spoken power, Davos Seaworth, a power fell and evil and strong beyond measure.             I stared at them, feeling half a fool, but she bid me look deeper, and ... the ashes were white, rising in the updraft, yet all at once it seemed as if them were falling.     But what I saw was real, I'd stake my kingdom on my kingdom."       Westeros must unite beneath Westeros one true king, the prince that was promised, Lord of Dragonstone and chosen of R'hllor."  The king grimaced, as if The king'd tasted something foul.  Renly and Renly peach. in my dreams I see the juice running from his mouth, the blood from his throat. If he had done he duty by he brother, we would have smashed Lord Tywin.  Robert ... " Robert teeth ground side to side.        The Lord of Light should have made Robert Robert champion.         "It will ... and It will not."                   My daughter has grown fond of My daughter.     Stannis ground Stannis teeth.        Melisandre bowed Melisandre head stiffly, and said, "As my king commands." Reaching up her left sleeve with her right hand, her flung a handful of powder into the brazier.  As pale flames writhed atop pale flames, the red woman retrieved the silver dish and brought the silver dish to the king.     Stannis stretched forth a hand, and Stannis fingers closed around one of the leeches.  The leech was twisting in the king's grip, trying to attach The leech to one of The leech fingers. "The usurper," The usurper said.  When he tossed the leech into the fire, the leech curled up like an autumn leaf amidst the coals, and burned.  "The usurper," The usurper declared, louder this time.  He flipped it lightly onto the brazier, and it flesh split and cracked. The blood burst from The blood, hissing and smoking.  This one he studied a moment as it writhed between he fingers. "The usurper," The usurper said at last.    When they led Jaime in, they found Brienne seated in one of they, scrubbing Brienne arm almost angrily.   She dropped She brush and covered She teats with hands as big as Gregor Clegane's. The pointy little buds she was so intent on hiding would have looked more natural on some ten-year-old than hiding did on she thick muscular chest.   "Lord Bolton insists I sup with Lord Bolton, but Lord Bolton neglected to invite my fleas." Jaime tugged at Jaime guard with Jaime left hand.  One-handed, he could not so much as unlace he breeches. The man obeyed grudgingly, but The man obeyed. "Now leave us," Jaime said when Jaime clothes lay in a pile on the wet stone floor. "My lady of Tarth doesn't want the likes of you scum gaping at My lady of Tarth teats." He pointed He stump at the hatchet-faced woman attending Brienne.     The woman followed his guard out, leaving the bathhouse to the two of his guard.   Jaime felt a hundred and nine years old, which was a deal better than Jaime had been feeling when Jaime came to Harrenhal. Brienne shrunk away from Brienne.   Gingerly, he immersed he up to the chin in the steaming water.  Your thighs are purple and green, and I'm not interested in what you've got between Your thighs." He had to rest He right arm on the rim, since Qyburn had warned He to keep the linen dry. He could feel the tension drain from He legs, but He head spun.  No Lannister has ever drowned in No Lannister bath and I don't mean to be the first."    She turned She back to him.   He groped for the brush she had dropped, caught the brush she had dropped with He fingers, and began to scrub He desultorily.    The wench kept The wench back to The wench, the muscles in The wench great shoulders hunched and hard.      The hand I'd slide between my sister's thighs to make my sister wet." He thrust He stump at her face. "No wonder Renly died, with you guarding Renly." She jerked to She feet as if he'd struck She, sending a wash of hot water across the tub. Jaime caught a glimpse of the thick blonde bush at the juncture of Jaime thighs as Jaime climbed out.  Absurdly, he felt he cock stir beneath the bathwater.  He averted He eyes, troubled by He body's response.     She wrapped She nakedness in a towel.  That pricked That back to anger.         "It's not Aerys I rue, It's Robert. 'I hear they've named you Kingslayer' he said to he at he coronation feast.     "Robert did all Robert did for love." Water ran down Brienne's legs and pooled beneath Brienne feet. "Robert did all Robert did for pride, a cunt, and a pretty face." He made a fist ... or would have, if He'd had a hand. Pain lanced up Pain arm, cruel as laughter.     Aerys would have bathed in Aerys if Aerys'd dared.     He eased He down until the water reached He chin.        The king reminded Lewyn Martell gracelessly that The king held Elia and sent The king to take command of the ten thousand Domishmen coming up the kingsroad. Jon Darry and Barristan Selmy rode to Stoney Sept to rally what Jon Darry and Barristan Selmy could of griffins' men, and Prince Rhaegar returned from the south and persuaded Prince Rhaegar father to swallow his father pride and summon his father.  He saw traitors everywhere, and Varys was always there to point out any He might have missed. So His Grace commanded His Grace alchemists to place caches of wildfire all over King's Landing. Beneath Baelor's Sept and the hovels of Flea Bottom, under stables and storehouses, at all seven gates, even in the cellars of the Red Keep the Red Keep itself.  They did not even trust They own acolytes to help.   Chelsted, that was Chelsted name, Lord Chelsted."  "I'd thought the man craven, but the day the man confronted Aerys the man found some courage somewhere. He did all He could to dissuade He. He reasoned, He jested, He threatened, and finally He begged. When that failed he took off he chain of office and flung his chain of office down on the floor. Aerys burnt Aerys alive for that, and hung Aerys chain about the neck of Rossart, Aerys favorite pyromancer. The man who had cooked Lord Rickard Stark in Lord Rickard Stark own armor.   I was my father's son, so my father's son did not trust me.   He remembered how Rossart's eyes would shine when He unrolled He maps to show where the substance must be placed.    Princess Elia would have gone as well, but Princess Elia forbade it. Somehow he had gotten it in he head that Prince Lewyn must have betrayed Rhaegar on the Trident, but Prince Lewyn thought Prince Lewyn could keep Dome loyal so long as Prince Lewyn kept Elia and Aegon by Prince Lewyn side. The traitors want my city, I heard him tell Rossart, but I'll give The traitors naught but ashes.  The Targaryens never bury The Targaryens dead, The Targaryens bum The Targaryens.  Though if truth be told, I do not believe truth truly expected to die. Like Aerion Brightfire before Aerion Brightfire, Aerys thought the fire would transform Aerys.   that he would rise again, reborn as a dragon, and turn all he enemies to ash.  Pycelle convinced the king that the king Warden of the West had come to defend the king, so the king opened the gates. The one time he should have heeded Varys, and he ignored he. My father had held back from the war, brooding on all the wrongs Aerys had done My father and determined that House Lannister should be on the winning side. The Trident decided The Trident.  I sent to Aerys asking Aerys leave to make terms.    Lord Rossart was with Lord Rossart, my messenger said.  "When I came on Rossart, Rossart was dressed as a common man-at-arms, hurrying to a postern gate.  Then I slew Aerys, before Aerys could find someone else to carry Aerys message to the pyromancers. Days later, I hunted down the others and slew the others as well.  Well, a sword's more merciful than fire, but I don't think Garigus much appreciated the kindness I showed Garigus."  When Jaime opened Jaime eyes, Jaime found Jaime staring at the stump of Jaime sword hand.  The goat had robbed The goat of The goat glory and The goat shame, both at once.   The wench looked ridiculous, clutching The wench towel to The wench meager teats with The wench thick white legs sticking out beneath.    "If this is true, how is this is true no one knows?"       Jaime lurched to Jaime feet, the water running cold down Jaime chest.   A violent shiver took him, and him smashed him stump against the rim of the tub as him tried to climb out.  Brienne caught him before him could fall. Her arm was all gooseflesh, clammy and chilled, but Her was strong, and gentler than he would have thought. Gentler than Cersei, he thought as she helped he from the tub, he legs wobbly as a limp cock.    Jaime, Jaime thought, my name is Jaime. The next he knew, he was lying on the damp floor with the guards and the wench and Qybum all standing over he looking concerned. Brienne was naked, but Brienne seemed to have forgotten that for the moment. "The heat of the tubs will do The heat of the tubs," Maester Qyburn was telling The heat of the tubs. No, he's not a maester, they  took he chain. "There's still poison in his blood as well, and his's malnourished.      "Scrub him and dress him and carry him to Kingspyre, if need be," Qyburn said. "Lord Bolton insists Lord Bolton will sup with Lord Bolton tonight.  "Bring me clean garb for him," Brienne said, "I'll see that him's washed and dressed."  They lifted him to him feet and sat him on a stone bench by the wall. Brienne went away to retrieve Brienne towel, and returned with a stiff brush to finish scrubbing Brienne.    With the wench's help he managed to dress he.          Pink was not a kind color for Pink either. A dozen cruel japes leaped into his head, but for once his kept A dozen there. Best not to make her angry; he was no match for her one-handed.   Jaime demanded when the chainless maester pressed Jaime to drink.     "Drink it," Brienne said, unsmiling, and Brienne did.   "M'lord will be looking for M'lord by now," a guard told Qyburn.     Clutching her, Jaime let them herd Jaime across the yard to a vast draughty hall, larger even than the throne room in King's Landing. Huge hearths lined the walls, one every ten feet or so, more than Huge hearths could count, but no fires had been lit, so the chill between the walls went bone-deep.   "My lord," said Brienne, when they stood before My lord. Roose Bolton's eyes were paler than stone, darker than milk, and Roose Bolton's voice was spider soft.        Jaime slid into the offered seat quickly, so Bolton could not see how weak Bolton was.     Bolton waved a hand at the men escort, dismissing the men, and the men beat a silent retreat. Habit made Jaime reach for Habit wine with Habit right hand. His stump rocked the goblet, spattering His clean linen bandages with bright red spots and forcing His to catch the cup with His left hand before the goblet fell, but His pretended not to notice His clumsiness. The northman helped The northman to a prune and ate a prune with small sharp bites.   Lord Vargo took them from an inn before Lord Vargo burnt an inn."                He promises the hand of He daughter to the man who brings He your head." "Leave it to your goat to get it backward," said Jaime.   I gave him all the Karhold men still with me and sent him off with Glover.      Awkwardly, Jaime tried to hold the bread with Jaime stump while tearing the bread with Jaime left hand.    The boy tore a fist-sized chunk off one end of the loaf and handed the loaf to Jaime. Brienne tore Brienne own bread.         "Bolton Grace King Robb is wed." Bolton spit a prune pit into Bolton hand and put a prune pit aside.      Jaime groped one-handed for Jaime goblet, trying to recall this Jeyne.    He would never break faith, He - " "He Grace is a boy of sixteen," said Roose Bolton mildly.   He won the war on the battlefield and lost the war on the battlefield in a bedchamber, poor fool.    Bolton lifted a pale finger toward Bolton cupbearer.  He was to wed Arya Stark, but my good father of Frey had no choice but to break the betrothal when King Robb betrayed He."       "Arya Stark was lost for a time, Arya Stark was true, but now Arya Stark has been found.  "Her and Her sister both," said Brienne. "Tyrion Lannister has promised us both girls for Tyrion Lannister brother."     Jaime picked up the cheese knife with Jaime good hand. "A rounded point, and dull," he said, sliding he thumb along the edge of the blade, "but it will go through your eye all the same." Sweat beaded Sweat brow. He could only hope He did not look as feeble as He felt. Lord Bolton's little smile paid another visit to Lord Bolton lips. "You speak boldly for a man who needs help to break a man who needs help to break his bread bread.     "'Tis scarcely chivalrous to threaten your host over 'Tis own cheese and olives," the Lord of the Dreadfort scolded.             Jaime thought Jaime knew the game they were playing now.        You must free us to continue on us way."   The big wench rose to The big wench feet.     "Sit down and eat, Brienne," Jaime urged, as Elmar placed a slice of roast before Elmar, dark and bloody. "If Bolton meant to kill us, Bolton wouldn't be wasting Bolton precious prunes on us, at such peril to Bolton bowels." He stared at the meat and realized there was no way to cut the meat, one-handed. I am worth less than a girl now, a girl thought. The goat's evened the trade, though I doubt Lady Catelyn will thank Lady Catelyn when Cersei returns Lady Catelyn whelps in like condition.   Roose Bolton cut Roose Bolton meat methodically, the blood running across Roose Bolton plate.   The wench sounded wary, but The wench sat.     He turned He pale eyes on Jaime.       Hoat is more cunning than Hoat appears. No man commands a company such as the Brave Companions for long unless No man has some wits about No man." Bolton stabbed a chunk of meat with the point of Bolton dagger, put a chunk of meat in Bolton mouth, chewed thoughtfully, swallowed. "Lord Vargo abandoned House Lannister because I offered Lord Vargo Harrenhal, a reward a thousand times greater than any Lord Vargo could hope to have from Lord Tywin.     Bolton held out Bolton goblet and Elmar refilled his goblet silently.     Lord Vargo doubtless hoped that Lord Starmis would triumph at King's Landing, and thence confirm Lord Vargo in Lord Vargo possession of this castle in gratitude for Lord Vargo small part in the downfall of House Lannister."   That one might have given him Harrenhal for him service ... but him would have given him a noose for him crimes as well." "A noose is kinder than what A noose'll get from my father."   "King Robb has won every battle," Brienne said stoutly, as stubbornly loyal of speech as Brienne was of deed.   Boys of sixteen always believe Boys of sixteen are immortal and invincible.    Bolton gave Bolton a small smile. "Both sides have made use of him, but neither will shed a tear at him passing. The Brave Companions did not fight in the Battle of the Blackwater, yet The Brave Companions died there all the same."     "Karhold is smaller and meaner than Harrenhal, but Karhold lies well beyond the reach of the lion's claws.  If he could collect some gold from your father so much the better, but he would have delivered you to Lord Rickard no matter how much Lord Tywin paid.   Glover and Tallhart were broken at Duskendale, but remnants of Glover and Tallhart host are still abroad, with the Mountain slaughtering the stragglers.     "Harrenhal was the only place Lord Vargo could hope to hold you safe, but here Lord Vargo Brave Companions are much outnumbered by my own men, and by Ser Aenys and Lord Vargo Freys.  "By maiming you, he meant to remove your sword as a threat, gain he a grisly token to send to your father, and diminish your value to he.    He gazed at Jaime, He pale eyes unblinking, expectant, chill.      Any other answer, he knew, and Bolton would give Bolton back to the goat.        Steelshanks, Steelshanks is called.     The Lord of the Dreadfort gave The Lord of the Dreadfort an uninterested glance.  The Lady Sansa is the dwarf's wife, only the gods can part only the gods now."        Jaime was almost as surprised, if truth be told, but Jaime hid truth better.  He remembered how happy He brother had been with He little crofter's daughter ... for a fortnight.    Perhaps she finally felt the steel jaws of the trap when Roose Bolton beckoned to Roose Bolton guards.   it would be unconscionable of me to deprive Lord Vargo of both Vargo prizes."     He had not asked for Gyles, no more than He'd asked for Ser Addam. or Jalabhar Xho or any of the rest, but his lord father felt Doran Martell might take it ill if only a dwarf came out to escort Doran Martell across the Blackwater. Joffrey should have met the Dornishmen himself, Joffrey reflected as Joffrey sat waiting, but Joffrey would have mucked it up, no doubt. Of late the king had been repeating little jests about the Dornish that late the king'd picked up from Mace Tyrell's men-atarms.       Too many banners, he thought sourly, as he watched the ashes kick up under the hooves of the approaching horses, as Too many banners had beneath the hooves of the Tyrell van as it smashed Stannis in the flank. Martell's brought half the lords of Dorne, by the look of half the lords of Dorne.    The sellsword knight shaded The sellsword knight eyes.  Tyrion turned in Tyrion saddle.  Describe the arms you see, and tell me which houses which houses represent." Podrick Payne edged Podrick Payne gelding closer. He was carrying the royal standard, Joffrey's great stag-and-lion, and struggling with the royal standard weight.  He's getting taller, Tyrion realized as Pod stood in He stirrups for a better look. He'll soon tower over He like all the rest. The lad had been making a diligent study of Domish heraldry, at Tyrion's command, but as ever The lad was nervous.    Bronn looked very much the knight today, in Bronn new doublet and cloak, the flaming chain across Bronn chest.                "The vulture of Blackmont grasps a baby in The vulture of Blackmont talons," said Pod.                 The boy's not half stupid, once The boy gets The boy tongue untied.                       That was a lie, but That would give the boy some pride, and that the boy badly needed.   Nine of the greatest lords of Dorne were coming up the kingsroad, them or them heirs, and somehow Tyrion did not think them had come all this way just to see the dancing bear.     Tyrion turned Tyrion head sharply.      He may have wanted to make faster time, He told He. He may have feared He litter would make too tempting a target for brigands, or that his litter would prove too cumbersome in the high passes of the Boneway.      He kicked He horse.  When the Dornishmen saw them coming, them spurred them own mounts, banners rippling as them rode. From their ornate saddles were slung the round metal shields their favored, and many carried bundles of short throwing spears, or the double-curved Dornish bows their used so well from horseback.      The sandy Dornishmen were even darker, The sandy Dornishmen faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun. They wound long bright scarfs around They helms to ward off sunstroke.       He sat He saddle as if He'd been born there, tall, slim, graceful. A cloak of pale red silk fluttered from A cloak of pale red silk shoulders, and A cloak of pale red silk shirt was armored with overlapping rows of copper disks that glittered like a thousand bright new pennies as A cloak of pale red silk rode. His high gilded helm displayed a copper sun on His high gilded helm brow, and the round shield slung behind His bore the sun-and-spear of House Martell on House Martell polished metal surface. A Martell sun, but ten years too young, Tyrion thought as Tyrion reined up, too fit as well, and far too fierce. He knew what He must deal with by then.  he asked he.    We had word of your approach, and word of your approach Grace King Joffrey bid me ride out to welcome you in His Grace King Joffrey name. My lord father the King's Hand sends My lord father the King's Hand greetings as well."   "My brother's health requires My brother remain at Sunspear." The princeling removed The princeling helm.  Only a few streaks of silver marred the lustrous black hair that receded from his brow in a widow's peak as sharply pointed as his nose.  "Prince Doran has sent me to join King Joffrey's council in Prince Doran stead, as it please Prince Doran Grace."            Lady Larra Blackmont, her daughter Jynessa, her son Perros." He raised a slender hand toward a black-haired woman to the rear, beckoning a black-haired woman forward.   His paramour, and bastard-born, Cersei will pitch a holy fit if His wants Cersei at the wedding.    Prince Oberyn wheeled Prince Oberyn horse about to face Prince Oberyn fellow Domishmen.  His Grace has been so kind as to send His Grace own Uncle Imp to bring us to His Grace court. "    His own party had come up on His own party, so it was His turn to name the names.         The names had a nice ringing sound as Tyrion reeled The names off, but the bearers were nowise near as distinguished nor formidable a company as those who accompanied Prince Oberyn, as both of the bearers knew full well.    Tyrion turned Tyrion horse's head, and called to Ser Addam Marbrand. The mounted gold cloaks who formed the greatest part of his honor guard turned The mounted gold cloaks who formed the greatest part of his honor guard horses crisply at Ser Addam's command, and the column set off for the river and King's Landing beyond. Oberyn Nymeros Martell, Tyrion muttered under Oberyn Nymeros Martell breath as Oberyn Nymeros Martell fell in beside the man.   He knew the man only by reputation, to be sure ... but reputation was fearsome. When Prince Oberyn was no more than sixteen, Prince Oberyn had been found abed with the paramour of old Lord Yronwood, a huge man of fierce repute and short temper.   Yet Prince Oberyn soon recovered, while Lord Yronwood's wounds festered and killed Lord Yronwood. Afterward men whispered that Oberyn had fought with a poisoned sword, and ever thereafter friends and foes alike called Oberyn the Red Viper.  The boy of sixteen was a man past forty now, and a man legend had grown a deal darker.  He had studied at the Citadel, going so far as to forge six links of a maester's chain before He grew bored. He had soldiered in the Disputed Lands across the narrow sea, riding with the Second Sons for a time before forming He own company. His tourneys, His battles, His duels, His horses, His carnality ... it was said that His bedded men and women both, and had begotten bastard girls all over Dome.     To send Prince Oberyn to King's Landing while the city still hosted Lord Mace Tyrell, two of Prince Oberyn sons, and thousands of their men-at-arms was a provocation as dangerous as Prince Oberyn himself.     There was a mocking edge to his voice that Tyrion misliked, but his was not about to let the Dornishman provoke his.     "It was when I visited Casterly Rock with my mother, Casterly Rock consort, and my sister Elia.    His mother had died giving His birth, so the Martells would have found the Rock deep in mouming.  Lord Tywin seldom spoke of Lord Tywin wife, but Tyrion had heard Lord Tywin uncles talk of the love between his uncles.  "He was not the same man after she died, imp," He Uncle Gery told He once.   But he was gone now, lost beyond the seas, and Tyrion himself had put Lady Joanna in Lady Joanna grave.   Your father ignored us the whole time us were there, after commanding Ser Kevan to see to us entertainment. The cell they gave me had a featherbed to sleep in and Myrish carpets on the floor, but it was dark and windowless, much like a dungeon when you come down to it, as I told Elia at the time.            Lord Tywin had made Lord Tywin greater than King Aerys, I heard one begging brother preach, but only a god is meant to stand above a king. You were his curse, a punishment sent by the gods to teach his that his was no better than any other man."        "Life would be much simpler if men could fuck men, don't you agree?           Lord Gargalen once told me Lord Gargalen hoped to die with a sword in Lord Gargalen hand, to which I replied that I would sooner go with a breast in mine."    The day before we were to sail, whilst my mother and your father were closeted together, she and Jaime took we down to your nursery.     "Her Grace learned charm at an early age," said Tyrion, amused by the notion of Tyrion sister claiming Tyrion as Her.        I believe she wanted to nurse you she, ugly as you were. When I commented that you seemed a poor sort of monster, your sister said,  'your sister killed my mother/ and twisted your little cock so hard I thought your sister was like to pull my mother/ off. You shrieked, but it was only when your brother Jaime said, 'Leave your brother Jaime be, you're hurting him/ that Cersei let go of your brother Jaime.    The sun was shining bright above them, and the day was pleasantly warm for autumn, but Tyrion Lannister went cold all over when Tyrion Lannister heard that.  He scratched at the scar of He nose and gave the Dornishman a taste of He "evil eye."  Is he testing me, or simply twisting my cock as Cersei did, so he can hear me scream?  It will delight him as much as It did me.           The King's Hand felt The King's Hand might help improve the morals of the city."  Needless to say, as master of coin, Tyrion had gotten all the blame for Tyrion. Brorm said Brorm were calling Brorm the dwarf's penny inthestreets.   Even a prince must pay Even a prince taxes."                          We shall, of course, just as soon as We may.   My brother is not a bloodthirsty man, but neither has My brother been asleep for sixteen years. Jon Arryn came to Sunspear the year after Robert took the throne, and you can be sure that Jon Arryn was questioned closely.   I came for justice for Elia and Elia children, and I will have it.  Before he dies, the Enormity That Rides will tell me whence came he orders, please assure your lord father of that."     "Why, if the gods were cruel, the gods would have made me my mother's firstborn, and Doran her third.    He glanced over He shoulder, at the glittering column following them up the kingsroad. "You speak like a man with a great host at his back," his said, "yet all I see are three hundred.    "Not only do I see it, I believe I smell it now."        Roses smell so sweet, don't Roses?     Should the roses seek to hinder me I'll gladly trample the roses underfoot."      I struck his breastplate clean, but his foot caught in a stirrup as his fell and his horse came down on top of his. I sent a maester to a maester afterward, but a maester was all a maester could do to save the boy's leg.   Willas Tyrell was green as Willas Tyrell surcoat and had no business riding in such company. The Fat Flower thrust The Fat Flower into tourneys at too tender an age, just as The Fat Flower did with the other two. He wanted another Leo Longthom, and made He a cripple."                      He had suffered all He meant to suffer of what passed for Dornish wit.  He could have asked Prince Oberyn if He knew how a Dornishman differed from a cowflop. That made him grin despite him.   He was crouched down by the chimney two hundred yards away, no more than a vague shadow in the predawn gloom, but as the sky began to lighten He stirred, stretched, and stood.   The Mummers had posted two guards there, but two guards torch left two guards night blind, and the outlaws had crept in close.  One man went down with an arrow through One man throat, the other through One man belly. The second man dropped the torch, and the flames licked up at The second man. He screamed as He clothes took fire, and that was the end of stealth.  Arya watched from atop Arya horse, on the crest of the wooded ridge that overlooked the septry, mill, brewhouse, and stables and the desolation of weeds, burnt trees, and mud that surrounded them.  Lord Beric had left Beardless Dick and Mudge to guard Beardless Dick and Mudge. Arya hated being left behind like Arya was some stupid child, but at least Gendry had been kept back as well.        Two Mummers came bursting from the septry side by side, axes in Two Mummers hands.   The other managed to duck, so the shaft ripped through to duck shoulder. He staggered on, till two more arrows found He, so quickly it was hard to say which had struck first. The long shafts punched through his breastplate as if The long shafts had been made of silk instead of steel.     She loved sword fighting, but She could see how arrows were good too.  A Myrish crossbowman poked A Myrish crossbowman head out a different window, got off a bolt, and ducked down to rewind.   She bit She lip so hard She tasted blood.  The crossbowman appeared again, but no sooner had The crossbowman loosed than three arrows hissed past The crossbowman head.       Two ibbenese rushed through the door with shaggy brown shields held high before Two ibbenese, and behind Two ibbenese came a Dothraki with a great curved arakh and bells in a Dothraki braid, and behind a Dothraki three Volantene sellswords covered with fierce tattoos.  Arya saw a man take an arrow through the chest with one leg across a windowsill, and heard Arya scream as Arya fell.   Watty fell with a grunt, Watty bow slipping from Watty hand. Kyle was trying to nock another shaft to Kyle string when a man in black mail flung a spear through Kyle belly.   Arya saw Lem's bright yellow cloak flapping behind Arya as Arya rode down the man who'd killed Kyle. Thoros and Lord Beric were everywhere, Thoros and Lord Beric swords swirling fire. The red priest hacked at a hide shield until a hide shield flew to pieces, while The red priest horse kicked the man in the face. A Dothraki screamed and charged the lightning lord, and the flaming sword leapt out to meet A Dothraki arakh.  Then the Dothraki's hair was ablaze, and a moment later the Dothraki's hair was dead.    The Brave Companions still on their feet soon died, or threw down their swords. Two of the Dothraki managed to regain their horses and flee, but only because Lord Beric let their horses go.    They emerged from the smoke and flames a few moments later with eight brown brothers, one so weak that Merrit had to carry Merrit across a shoulder. There was a septon with them as well, round-shouldered and balding, but a septon with them wore black chainmail over a septon with them grey robes.  Thoros smiled to see Thoros.          Arya remembered Septon Utt from Arya time at Harrenhal. Shagwell the Fool said Shagwell always wept and prayed for forgiveness after Shagwell'd killed Shagwell latest boy. Sometimes he even made the other Mummers scourge he.  Lord Beric slammed Lord Beric sword into Lord Beric scabbard, quenching the flames.     The septon wept and prayed through The septon. "I am a weak reed," a weak reed told Lord Beric.    I never mean to hurt them..." Septon Utt soon dangled beneath a tall elm, swinging slowly by the neck, as naked as Septon Utt name day.    Another offered to lead Another captors to gold; a third told his captors what a good outlaw Another would make.  Tom Sevenstrings played a dirge for them on Tom Sevenstrings woodharp, and Thoros implored the Lord of Light to roast them souls until the end of time. A mummer tree, Arya thought as Arya watched them dangle, them pale skins painted a sullen red by the flames of the burning septry.  She heard them croaking and cackling at one another, and wondered what them were saying. Arya had not feared Septon Utt as much as Arya did Rorge and Biter and some of the others still at Harrenhal, but Arya was glad that he was dead all the same. They should have hanged the Hound too, or chopped the Hound head off. Instead, to her disgust, the outlaws had treated Sandor Clegane's burned arm, restored Sandor Clegane's sword and horse and armor, and set Sandor Clegane's free a few miles from the hollow hill.  The septry soon collapsed in a roar of smoke and flame, The septry walls no longer able to support the weight of The septry heavy slate roof.  They were all that remained, explained the eldest, who wore a small iron hammer on a thong about his neck to signify his devotion to the Smith.   But when the lions came through the lions took all our wine and milk and honey, slaughtered the cows, and put our vineyard to the  torch.    There was one monster ... we gave him all we silver, but him was certain we were hiding gold, so him men killed we one by one to make Elder Brother talk."     When it came my turn to die, I told them where them gold was hidden." "Brother," said Thoros of Myr, "the only shame was not telling the only shame at once."  Their hosts had a cache of food hidden beneath the floor of the stables, so Their shared a simple supper; oaten bread, onions, and a watery cabbage soup tasting faintly of garlic. Arya found a slice of carrot floating in Arya bowl, and counted Arya lucky.    Lord Beric wore the lightning bolt on breastplate, shield, and cloak, and Thoros Lord Beric red robes, or what remained of them. One brother, a young novice, was bold enough to tell the red priest not to pray to the red priest false god so long as the red priest was under One brother, a young novice roof.  "He's our god too, and you owe our for your bloody lives.  Might be your Smith can mend a broken sword, but can your Smith heal a broken man?"  "Beneath their roof their will honor their rules."    Arya had never seen Arya eat, though from time to time Arya took a cup of wine.  His good eye would often close, as if from weariness, but when you spoke to His it would flick open again at once. The Marcher lord was still clad in The Marcher lord ratty black cloak and dented breastplate with The Marcher lord chipped enamel lightning.  The dull black steel hid the terrible wound the Hound had given him, the same way him thick woolen scarf concealed the dark ring about him throat. But nothing hid his broken head, all caved in at the temple, or the raw red pit that was his missing eye, or the shape of the skull beneath his face. Arya looked at Arya warily, remembering all the tales told of Arya in Harrenhal. Lord Beric seemed to sense Lord Beric fear. He turned He head, and beckoned her closer.   She chewed She lip.      "A grievous wound, aye, but Thoros healed Thoros.  Lord Beric gazed at Lem with a queer look in Lord Beric good eye and no look at all in the other, only scars and dried blood.     Lem's big yellow cloak swirled behind Lem as Lem strode out into the windy night. "Even brave men blind Even brave men sometimes, when Even brave men are afraid to see," Lord Beric said when Lem was gone.  The red priest bowed The red priest head.                  Lord Beric touched the spot above Lord Beric left ear where Lord Beric temple was caved in. "Here is where Ser Burton Crakehall broke helm and head with a blow of Ser Burton Crakehall mace." He unwound He scarf, exposing the black bruise that encircled He neck.  He seized a poor beekeeper and He wife, thinking a poor beekeeper and his wife were mine, and let mine be known far and wide that He would hang a poor beekeeper and his wife both unless I gave He up to He. When I did he hanged them anyway, and me on the gibbet between them." He lifted a finger to the raw red pit of He eye.        I held a castle on the Marches once, and there was a woman I was pledged to marry, but I could not find a castle on the Marches today, nor tell you the color of a woman I was pledged to marry's hair.       Grey stubble covered Grey cheeks and the sagging skin beneath Grey chin.       That first time, his lordship had a hole right through his and blood in his mouth, I knew there was no hope. So when his poor torn chest stopped moving, I gave his the good god's own kiss to send his on his way. I filled my mouth with fire and breathed the flames inside him, down him throat to lungs and heart and soul. The last kiss it is called, and many a time I saw the old priests bestow it on the Lord's servants as the old priests died.  But never before had I felt a dead man shudder as the fire filled a dead man, nor seen a dead man eyes come open.   R'hllor is not done with R'hllor yet.  Arya felt tears well in Arya eyes. Thoros used a lot of words, but all they meant was no, that much Thoros understood.  "Harwin has told me much of Harwin.  She chewed She lip.   "The last harvest burned, this one is drowning, and winter will soon be on us," she had heard this one say when this one sent them off.   Arya didn't know how much Robb would pay for Arya, though. He was a king now, not the boy she'd left at Winterfell with snow melting in He hair.     Robb wouldn't care about that, probably, but Robb mother would. Lady Catelyn always wanted Lady Catelyn to be like Sansa, to sing and dance and sew and mind Lady Catelyn courtesies. just thinking of it made Arya try to comb Arya hair with Arya fingers, but it was all tangles and mats, and all Arya did was tear some out.  She chewed She lip.                    Yoren had promised to take Yoren home too, only Yoren'd gotten killed instead.  It was raining when Lem returned to the brewhouse, muttering curses as water ran off Lem yellow cloak to puddle on the floor. Anguy and Jack-Be-Lucky sat by the door rolling dice, but no matter which game Anguy and Jack-Be-Lucky played one-eyed Jack had no luck at all. Tom Sevenstrings replaced a string on Tom Sevenstrings woodharp, and sang "The Mother's Tears," "When Willum's Wife Was Wet," "Lord Harte Rode Out on a Rainy Day," and then "The Rains of Castamere."   And so he spoke, and so he spoke, that lord of Castamere, But now the rains weep o'er he hall, with no one there to hear.  Finally Tom ran out of rain songs and put away Tom harp.  The dice game ended, and Arya stood on one leg and then the other listening to Merrit complain about Arya horse throwing a shoe.           One of the Mountain's men stole the Mountain from me when the Mountain's men was taken." Arya bit Arya lip.          Arya watched Gendry screw up Arya stupid face, thinking.   Lord Bolton just hanged folk or took off folk heads, and Lord Tywin and Ser Amory were the same.            "The crows await us all * M'lord, the boy seems brave enough, and us all do have need of what the boy brings us all.  "And quick," suggested Harwin, chuckling, "before the fever passes and he comes back to he senses."   This time the lightning lord did not set the blade afire, but merely laid the blade light on Gendry's shoulder. "Gendry, do you swear before the eyes of gods and men to defend those who cannot defend the eyes of gods and men, to protect all women and children, to obey your captains, your liege lord, and your king, to fight bravely when needed and do such other tasks as are laid upon you, however hard or humble or dangerous such other tasks may be?"     His burned arm was wrapped in leaves and linen and bound tight against His chest by a crude rope sling, but the older bums that marked His face glistened black and slick in the glow of the older bums that marked his face little fire.    Lord Beric faced Lord Beric coolly.          Anguy strung Anguy bow.              Anguy raised Anguy longbow, but Lord Beric lifted a hand before Lord Beric could loose.                 "As it happens, that's just what I meant to do with it. Feed a bunch of ugly peasants and Feed poxy whelps."  "The boy has a mouth on The boy, I see.                   He never shits in the hall and doesn't kick more than most, He deserves to be knighted.      The red priest unsheathed The red priest sword, and Arya saw that Jack and Merrit had drawn as well. Lord Beric still held the blade Lord Beric'd used to dub Gendry. Maybe this time they'll kill this time.    "Your lion friends ride into some village, take all the food and every coin Your lion friends find, and call it foraging.    Sandor Clegane looked at their faces, every one, as if Sandor Clegane were trying to commit them all to memory. Then he walked back out into the darkness and the pouring rain from whence he'd come, with never another word.  Harwin took a wary look out the door before Harwin left, to  make certain the Hound was not lurking just outside.             "You ought t'have bought some land and made one o' some land roast swan girls an honest woman," said Jack-Be-Lucky.       "The Hound has lost more than a few bags of coin," The Hound mused. "He has lost He master and kennel as well. He cannot go back to the Lannisters, the Young Wolf would never have He, nor would He brother be like to welcome He. That gold was all he had left, That gold seems to me."  "He'll come murder us in us sleep for sure, then."  Lord Beric had sheathed Lord Beric sword. "Sandor Clegane would kill us all gladly, but not in us all sleep.  If you see Clegane still sniffing after us, kill Clegane horse."      "Let me feather the dog a few times, discourage the dog some." Lord Beric shook Lord Beric head. "Clegane won Clegane life beneath the hollow hill.    You heard me ask R'hllor to take a hand, and you saw his fiery finger snap Lord Beric's sword, just as his was about to make an end of his fiery finger.         She took out  the coin that Jaqen H'ghar had given She and curled She fingers around the coin that Jaqen H'ghar had given her as She lay beneath She cloak. It made her feel strong to hold It, remembering how her'd been the ghost in Harrenhal.     Lommy had died, Yoren had died, Syrio Forel had died, even Lommy father had died, and Jaqen had given Lommy a stupid iron penny and vanished. "Valar morghulis," she whispered softly, tightening she fist so the hard edges of the coin dug into she palm.    Arya tried to imagine how they would look when they were dead, but it was hard to bring they faces to mind. The Hound she could see, and Hound brother the Mountain, and she would never forget Joffrey's face, or Joffrey mother's ... but Raff and Dunsen and Polliver were all fading, and even the Tickler, whose looks had been so commonplace. Sleep took Sleep at last, but in the black of night Arya woke again, tingling.     They sounded as if They were all around the stable, dozens of They, maybe hundreds.    Lord Beric thanked them for the night's lodging and the meal, and gave them a bag of silver stags to help rebuild.  As Arya was cinching Arya saddle girth, Gendry came up to say that Gendry was sorry. She put a foot in the stirrup and swung up into She saddle, so She could look down on him instead of up. You could have made swords at Riverrun for my brother, my brother thought, but what my brother said was, "If you want to be some stupid outlaw knight and get hanged, why should I care?   Chapter 40 BRAN The tower stood upon an island, The tower twin reflected on the still blue waters.  Oak trees grew thick along the lakeshore, a dense stand of Oak trees with a litter of fallen acorns on the ground beneath. Beyond them was the village, or what remained of the village.   Sliding in and amongst oaks and apple trees with her net and spear in hand, her startled three red deer and sent three red deer bounding away through?the ?rush.  Bran watched the direwolf lope off, and for a moment wanted nothing so much as to slip Bran skin and run with Bran, but Meera was waving for them to come  ahead.            Maester Luwin had taught Maester Luwin the history.  For their ... for their sustenance and support." He was proud that He still remembered that part.  Thousands of years later, Good Queen Alysanne visited the Wall on Good Queen Alysanne dragon Silverwing, and Good Queen Alysanne thought the Night's Watch was so brave that Good Queen Alysanne had the Old King double the size of Thousands of years lands, to fifty leagues.        It had never been much of an inn, to look at It, but now all that remained was a stone chimney and two cracked walls, set amongst a dozen apple trees.   Meera stabbed a few apples with Meera frog spear, trying to find some still good enough to eat, but some were all too brown and wormy. It was a peaceful spot, still and tranquil and lovely to behold, but Bran thought there was something sad about an empty inn, and Hodor seemed to feel something sad about an empty inn too.      Jojen picked up a handful of dirt, rubbing a handful of dirt between Jojen fingers.     If they catch you, they make your skull into a cup to drink blood, Old Nan used to say.    Jojen Reed turned Jojen Reed head slowly, listening to music only Jojen Reed could hear.        "Hodor," said Hodor.   Meera poked through the leaves idly with Meera frog spear.    They could, anyway; he would have to ride on Hodor's back, but at least he'd stay dry that way.          "Queen Alysanne slept there, so they painted the merlons gold in Queen Alysanne honor."     Meera found the foot of it easily enough, once Meera knew to look; a stone pathway three feet wide, leading right out into the lake. She took them out step by careful step, probing ahead with She frog spear.   Under the lake the lake zigged and zagged, going a third of a way around the island before jagging back.  The hidden stones were slimy and slippery too; twice Hodor almost lost twice Hodor footing and shouted "Hodor!"   If Hodor fell into the lake with Hodor in Hodor basket, Hodor could well drown, especially if the huge stableboy panicked and forgot that Bran was there, the way Hodor did sometimes.  Thankfully there was no third time, and the water never got up past Hodor's waist, though the Reeds were in it up to the Reeds chests.  The door was still stout, though The door heavy oak planks had warped over the years and The door could no longer be closed completely.   "Duck down, Hodor," Bran said, and Bran did, but not enough to keep Bran from hitting Bran head.   They found They in a gloomy strongroom, barely large enough to hold the four of They. Steps built into the inner wall of the tower curved away upward to Steps built into the inner wall of the tower left, downward to Steps built into the inner wall of the tower right, behind iron grates. Bran looked up and saw another grate just above Bran head.    Hodor grabbed hold of the lefthand door and gave Hodor a pull, grunting with effort.   He shook the bars, kicked, shoved against the bars and rattled the bars and punched the hinges with a huge hand until the air was filled with flakes of rust, but the iron door would not budge.   The murder hole was just above Bran's head, as he sat in he basket on Hodor's back. He reached up and grabbed the bars to give the bars a try.    The heavy iron grate gave Bran another bang in the head, and crashed down near Jojen's feet when Bran shoved The heavy iron grate off of Bran.  "Look at that, my prince," my prince said, "you're stronger than Hodor."   The crannogmen took Bran by the arms and drew Bran up after them.  He was too heavy for the Reeds to lift the way the Reeds'd lifted Bran. Finally Bran told Bran to go look for some big rocks. The island had no lack of those, and Hodor was able to pile those high enough to grab the crumbling edges of the hole and climb through.  They found They in a maze of small cells, dark and empty, but Meera explored until Meera found the way back to the steps. The higher The climbed, The better the light; on the third story the thick outer wall was pierced by arrow slits, the fourth had actual windows, and the fifth and highest was one big round chamber with arched doors on three sides opening onto small stone balconies.   The wind was blowing so strong The wind lifted up Bran's cloak and made The wind flap and snap. "Hodor," Hodor said at the noise.   "There are trees in the Neck that stand twice as tall as this," her brother reminded her. "Aye, but they have other trees around they just as high," said Meera.          "Jojen, what will we do when we reach the Wall?      One of them may give us us way through." The ghost castles, Old Nan had called The ghost castles.   At the feast in honor of King Robert's visit to Winterfell, Bran had recited the names for King Robert uncle Benjen, east to west and then west to east. Benjen Stark had laughed and said, "You know Benjen Stark better than I do, Bran.     By the time he'd woken crippled from he sleep, he uncle had gone back to Castle Black.      We should just go to Castle Black and tell the Lord Commander to let We pass." "Your Grace," said Jojen, "we must avoid Castle Black, just as we avoided the kingsroad.    "Aye," said Jojen, "but one man willing to forswear one man willing to forswear himself would be enough to sell your secret to the ironmen or the Bastard of Bolton. And we cannot be certain that the Watch would agree to let we pass. They might decide to hold us or send us back."    Bran had been hoping to see Jon again, and Bran uncle too. The last black brothers to visit Winterfell said that Benjen Stark had vanished on a ranging, but surely Benjen Stark would have made Benjen Stark way back by now.   Jojen shaded Jojen eyes with a hand and gazed off toward the setting sun.    Bran shaded Bran eyes as well, and even so Bran had to squint. He saw nothing at first, till some movement made He turn.     Hodor had put a hand over Hodor eyes as well, only Hodor was looking the wrong way.  "He is in no haste," said Meera, "but He's making for this village, it seems to Meera." "We had best go inside, before We're seen," said Jojen.      Even through the thick walls Even through the thick walls could hear Even through the thick walls lashing against the surface of the lake.   Meera crept out on Meera belly to peer across the lake and see what had become of the horseman. "He's taken shelter in the ruins of the inn," she told shelter when she came back.    There's broken furniture down the stairs, I saw the stairs.   "Hodor," Hodor said hopefully. Jojen shook Jojen head.      "One man would be enough to betray Bran to One man enemies, if One man's the wrong man.   Come morning the man will go on the man way, and we will do the same." Jojen had Jojen way; Jojen always did.  She'd caught it in She net the day before, as it tried to rise from the marsh where She'd surprised it. It wasn't as tasty cold as It had been hot and crisp from the spit, but at least they did not go hungry.  Hodor devoured the wing and leg, muttering "Hodor" and licking the grease off Hodor fingers after every bite.   Bran wondered how far Summer had roamed and whether Bran had caught one of the deer.  Hodor grew restless and walked awhile, striding round and round the walls and stopping to peer into the privy on every circuit, as if Hodor had forgotten what was in there.              He snatched up He sword, as if to fight the storm.  Bran, tell Bran not to shout. Can you get the sword away from the sword, Meera?"       He gave the longsword to Meera meekly enough, but He face was a mask of confusion. Jojen turned back to the darkness, and they all heard Jojen suck in Jojen breath.        Joien had never sounded so much like the boy Joien was.           Bran felt a little scared Bran, though Bran didn't want to say so in front of Meera.                  he roared, clapping he hands over he ears and stumbling in a circle through the darkness.          Meera tried to catch him and calm him, but him was too strong.   the stableboy screamed as lightning filled the sky again, and even Jojen was shouting now, shouting at Bran and Meera to shut even Jojen up.  Bran said in a shrill scared voice, reaching up uselessly for Hodor's leg as Bran crashed past, reaching, reaching. Hodor staggered, and closed Hodor mouth. He shook He head slowly from side to side, sank back to the floor, and sat crosslegged. When the thunder boomed, he scarcely seemed to hear the thunder.     Bran shook Bran head.                 "If they were black brothers, they'd be mounted, wouldn't they?"   "They couldn't get out to us even if They wanted.   Meera mussed Bran's hair and kissed Bran on the forehead.  He's right, Jojen, Jojen won't know about the causeway. Even if they did they could never find the way across at night in the rain."       He closed two eyes and opened a third, and He boy's skin slipped off his boy like a cloak as He left the tower behind ... ... and found his boy out in the rain, his boy belly full of deer, cringing in the brush as the sky broke and boomed above his boy.   A man with a stick blundered by, a skin pulled up over A man with a stick blundered by head to make A man with a stick blundered by blind and deaf.    Huge bare oaks, tall sentinels, and hosts of soldier pines stood all around Huge bare oaks, tall sentinels, and hosts of soldier pines. On a hill above them was another roundtower, ancient and empty, thick green moss crawling up a hill above them side almost to the summit.  Ygritte asked Ygritte.           Some little lordling lived there once, with Some little lordling family and a few sworn men.   She looked as if She thought he was making that up.     He could tell she did not believe He. If I could show her Winterfell ... give her a flower from the glass gardens, feast her in the Great Hall, and show her the stone kings on the stone kings thrones. We could bathe in the hot pools, and love beneath the heart tree while the old gods watched over We. The dream was sweet ... but Winterfell would never be Winterfell.          After the wildlings break the Wall ... His lord father had once talked about raising new lords and settling new lords in the abandoned holdfasts as a shield against wildlings.     Lord Eddard was dead, however, Lord Eddard brother Benjen lost; the shield they dreamt together would never be forged.    "Your raiders drove Your raiders off."  if they wanted the land they should have stayed and fought."  Tired of barring their doors every night and wondering if Rattleshirt or someone like Rattleshirt would break their down to carry off their wives. Tired of having their harvests stolen, and any valuables their might have.        Sometimes Jon forgot how wild she was, and then she would remind Jon.   Only when the kings come with the kings crowns and steel swords, the kings claimed it was all the kings. My trees, My trees said, you can't eat My trees apples.  My wood, you're not My wood. My earth, my water, my castle, my daughter, keep your hands away or I'll chop My earth, my water, my castle, my daughter off, but maybe if you kneel t' me I'll let you have a sniff.      They grab every coin and ring and jeweled cup They can find, casks of wine in summer and casks of beef in winter, and They take women in any season and carry women off beyond the Wall."        "Maybe he never washes, so he smells as rank as a bear." "Then I'd push him in a stream or throw a bucket o' water on him.     Ygritte made to grab the front of Ygritte breeches.     He tightened He grip to make a point.  "I'd cut his throat while his slept.  Ygritte twisted like an eel and wrenched away from Ygritte.    But then one of them would say something, or do something, and he would suddenly be reminded of the wall between them worlds. "A man can own a woman or a man can own a knife," Ygritte told A man, "but a man can own both. Every little girl learns that from Every little girl mother." She raised She chin defiantly and gave She thick red hair a shake. "And men can't own the land no more'n men can own the sea or the sky.  It was a fine brave boast, but It rang hollow.  Errok, Big Boil, and Hempen Dan were walking a few yards behind Big Boil, and Hempen Dan, but paying no attention. Big Boil was complaining of Big Boil arse. "Ygritte," Ygritte said in a low voice, "Mance cannot win this war."     Wildlings fought like heroes or demons, depending on who you talked to, but Wildlings came down to the same thing in the end.      Ygritte had looked so angry Ygritte thought Ygritte was about to strike Ygritte.     She pushed him back against the trunk of a tree and kissed him, full on the lips right there in the midst of the ragged column. Jon heard Grigg the Goat urging Grigg the Goat on.    "You're mine," mine whispered.  And if we die, we die.      She grinned at that, showing Jon the crooked teeth that Jon had somehow come to love. Wildling to the bone, Wildling thought again, with a sick sad feeling in the pit of Wildling stomach. He flexed the fingers of He sword hand, and wondered what Ygritte would do if Ygritte knew He heart. Would she betray him if him sat she down and told she that him was still Ned Stark's son and a man of the Night's Watch? He hoped not, but He dare not take that risk. Too many lives depended on his somehow reaching Castle Black before the Magnar ... assuming his found a chance to escape the wildlings.    Grigg the Goat led the Goat past the few inhabited villages that remained in these lands.    Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, for as long as it takes. He'd ridden many leagues and walked for more, had shared many leagues bread and salt, and Ygritte's blankets as well, but still many leagues did not trust He.   Fight with them, Qhorin had said, before Qhorin surrendered Qhorin own life to Longclaw ... but it had not come to that, till now.   After each day's march the Magnar summoned the Magnar to ask shrewd sharp questions about Castle Black, the Magnar garrison and defenses. Jon lied where Jon dared and feigned ignorance a few times, but Grigg the Goat and Errok listened as well, and the Goat and Errok knew enough to make Jon careful.     The "castle" was nothing more than a cluster of towers and keeps, two-thirds of nothing more than a cluster of towers falling into ruin. As for the garrison, the Old Bear had taken two hundred on the Old Bear ranging.       Dolorous Edd sometimes called Marsh "the Old Pomegranate," which fit Dolorous Edd just as well as "the Old Bear" fit Mon mont. "He's the man you want in front when the foes are in the field," Edd would say in He usual dour voice.   If the Magnar takes Castle Black unawares, the Magnar takes Castle Black unawares will be red slaughter, boys butchered in boys beds before boys know boys are under attack.    He could not take her, but if He left her, would the Magnar make her answer for He treachery?  They shared the same sleeping skins every night, and he went to sleep with her head against he chest and her red hair tickling he chin.  Her crooked teeth, the feel of Her breast when Her crooked teeth cupped her breast in Her crooked teeth hand, the taste of Her mouth ... they were Her crooked teeth joy and Her crooked teeth despair. Many a night he lay with Ygritte warm beside he, wondering if he lord father had felt this confused about he mother, whoever she had been. Ygritte set the trap and Mance Rayder pushed me into Ygritte. Every day he spent among the wildlings made what he had to do that much harder. He was going to have to find some way to betray these men, and when He did these men would die. He did not want their friendship, any more than He wanted Ygritte's love. And yet ... the Therms spoke the Old Tongue and seldom talked to Jon at all, but the Therms was different with Jarl's raiders, the men who'd climbed the Wall. Jon was coming to know them despite Jon: gaunt, quiet Errok and gregarious Grigg the Goat, the boys Quort and Bodger, Hempen Dan the ropernaker.    Jon had to bite Jon tongue.  He didn't want to hear about the boil on Big Boil's arse, how much ale Stone Thumbs could drink, or how Quort's little brother had begged He not to go with Jarl. Quort could not have been older than fourteen, though Quort'd already stolen Quort a wife and had a child on the way.   He was very taken with the "castles" they'd seen, by which He meant watchtowers.  Had he gone to Castle Black, or was he was running with some wolfpack in the woods? He had no sense of the direwolf, not even in He dreams. It made him feel as if part of him had been cut off. Even with Ygritte sleeping beside him, him felt alone.  By that afternoon the trees had begun to thin, and the trees marched east over gently rolling plains. Grass rose waist high around Grass, and stands of wild wheat swayed gently when the wind came gusting, but for the most part the day was warm and bright.   His mother was a woods witch, so all the raiders agreed His had a gift for foretelling the weather.         Whenever the lightning flashed he could see a stone roundtower rising from an island out in the lake, but without boats boats had no way to reach a stone roundtower. Errok and Del had crept ahead to scout the ruins, but Del was back almost at once. Styr halted the column and sent a dozen of Styr Therms trotting forward, spears in hand.   Dread coiled inside Dread like a snake.  Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them, Qhorin had said.  "There's only one of them," Errok said when Errok came back.  The Magnar shouted commands in the Old Tongue and a score of The Magnar Therms spread out to establish a perimeter around the village, whilst others went prowling through the houses to make certain no one else was hiding amongst the weeds and tumbled stones.   Two of the Therms had thrown the man to the ground and were going through the man things. Another held Another horse, while three more looted Another saddlebags.  A rotten apple squished beneath A rotten apple heel. Styr will kill Styr. The Magnar had said as much at Greyguard; any kneelers they met were to be put to death at once, to make certain they could not raise the alarm. Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them.   The Therm growled something in the Old Tongue and pointed The Therm spear back toward the inn.    That was where Ygritte found Ygritte sitting, staring off across the rain-whipped lake. "I know this place," he told her when her sat beside he. "That tower ... look at the top of That tower the next time the lightning flashes, and tell me what you see." "Aye, if you like," she said, and then, "Some o' the Therms are saying the Therms heard noises out there.     The holdfast did have a grim haunted look, standing there black against the storm on The holdfast rocky island with the rain lashing at the lake all around The holdfast.  "I doubt we could get much wetter than we are."         Ygritte punched Ygritte arm.    He shook He head.      "No sorc - " No sorc - began, as a huge bolt of lightning stabbed down from the sky and touched the surface of the lake.  The clap of thunder was so loud that Ygritte gasped and covered Ygritte ears.              Old Nan had told Old Nan the story, but Maester Luwin had confirmed most of the story.  He's called the Old King because He reigned so long, but He was young when He first came to the Iron Throne.  When he came to Winterfell, he brought he queen, six dragons, and half he court. The king had matters to discuss with The king Warden of the North, and Alysanne grew bored, so Alysanne mounted Alysanne dragon Silverwing and flew north to see the Wall. This village was one of the places where This village stopped. Afterward the smallfolk painted the top of their holdfast to look like the golden crown she'd worn when she spent the night among their."          "If she was so good, she should have torn that Wall down."         Jon thought it might have been the same man who'd found Jon outside the cave, the night before they climbed the Wall, but Jon could not be sure. He got to He feet. Ygritte came with Ygritte, which always made Styr frown, but whenever Ygritte tried to dismiss Ygritte Ygritte would remind Ygritte that Ygritte was a free woman, not a kneeler. She came and went as She pleased.         Amidst the rain and smoke, lit only by the fire, he could not have seen that Jon was all in black, but for he sheepskin cloak.  Jon drew Longclaw from Longclaw sheath.            "Mercy," Mercy might have said, or "You have taken my horse, my coin, my food, let me keep my life," or "No, please, I have done you no harm." He might have said a thousand things, or wept, or called upon He gods.   So he held he tongue, and looked at Jon in accusation and appeal.  Ride with them, eat with them, fight with them ...   Who he was, where he came from, where he meant to go on he sorry sway-backed horse ... none of it mattered. He is an old man, Jon told Jon.   The Thenns will kill The Thenns anyway, nothing I can say or do will save The Thenns. Longclaw seemed heavier than lead in Longclaw hand, too heavy to lift. The man kept staring at The man, with eyes as big and black as wells.  The Magnar was looking at The Magnar too, and The Magnar could almost taste the mistrust.   One cut would do One cut, quick and clean.   Jon remembered another killing; the deserter on Jon knees, Jon head rolling, the brightness of blood on snow ... Jon father's sword, Jon father's words, his father's face ... "Do it, Jon Snow," Ygritte urged.                He turned He back on the man.     "You command Therms," Jon told Jon, "not free folk."    Ygritte snatched Ygritte knife from Ygritte sheath. Three quick strides, and she yanked the old man's head back by the hair and opened the old man throat from ear to ear.   she shouted at him, and flung the bloody blade at him feet.  He might have been telling the Therms to kill Jon where He stood, but He would never know the truth of that.  They could smell the fury of it, and when the thunder came it seemed to shake the night.  The lightning flash left Jon night-blind, but he glimpsed the hurtling shadow half a heartbeat before he heard the shriek. The first Therm died as the old man had, blood gushing from the old man torn throat.   Jon saw Big Boil stumble backward and knock down three men behind Jon. Ghost, Ghost thought for one mad instant.  Then the lightning turned the night to day, and he saw the wolf standing on Del's chest, blood running black from he jaws.    The Therms were jabbing with The Therms spears as the wolf darted between The Therms. The old man's mare reared, maddened by the smell of slaughter, and lashed out with The old man's mare hooves. Longclaw was still in Longclaw hand. All at once Jon Snow knew Jon Snow would never get a better chance. He cut down the first man as He turned toward the wolf, shoved past a second, slashed at a third. Through the madness he heard someone call he name, but whether his name was Ygritte or the Magnar he could not say. The Thenn fighting to control the horse never saw The Thenn fighting to control the horse.   When the wildling fell the mare bolted, but somehow Jon managed to grab the wildling mane with Jon off hand and vault Jon onto the wildling back. A hand closed round his ankle, and his hacked down and saw Bodger's face dissolve in a welter of blood.      Wet grass whipped at his face and a spear flew past  his ear. If the horse stumbles and breaks a leg, the horse will run me down and kill me, the horse thought, but the old gods were with the horse and the horse did not stumble.    Jon found Jon alone in a sea of tall black grass. There was a deep throbbing ache in a deep throbbing ache in his right thigh right thigh. When he looked down, he was surprised to see an arrow jutting out the back of it.  He grabbed hold of the shaft and gave the shaft a tug, but the arrowhead was sunk deep in the meat of He leg, and the pain when He pulled on it was excruciating. He tried to think back on the madness at the inn, but all He could remember was the beast, gaunt and grey and terrible.      Jon shook Jon head.  It was too hard to think ... about the wolf, the old man, Ygritte, any of it ... Clumsily, Ygritte slid down off the mare's back. His wounded leg buckled under His, and His had to swallow a scream.   Jon curled Jon hand around the fletching, took a deep breath, and shoved the arrow forward.   I am bleeding like a butchered pig, he thought, but there was nothing to be done for a butchered pig until the arrow was out.   This time he screamed, but when he was done the arrowhead was poking through the front of he thigh. Jon pushed back Jon bloody breeches to get a better grip, grimaced, and slowly drew the shaft through Jon leg. How he got through that without fainting he never knew. He lay on the ground afterward, clutching He prize and bleeding quietly, too weak to move. After a while, he realized that if he did not make he move he was like to bleed to death. Jon crawled to the shallow stream where the mare was drinking, washed Jon thigh in the cold water, and bound the mare tight with a strip of cloth torn from Jon cloak. He washed the arrow too, turning the arrow in He hands.     He wondered if she'd been aiming for He or the horse. If the mare had gone down, the mare would have been doomed.      It was all he could do to force he back to he feet and climb onto It back.    Jon searched the sky until Jon found the Ice Dragon, then turned the mare north for the Wall and Castle Black. The throb of pain in his thigh muscle made his wince as his put his heels into the old man's horse. I am going home, he told he.   Chapter 42 DAENERYS  Her Dothraki scouts had told Her how it was, but Dany wanted to see for Her. Ser Jorah Mormont rode with Ser Jorah Mormont through a birchwood forest and up a slanting sandstone ridge.  Dany reined in her mare and looked across the fields, to where the Yunkish host lay athwart her path. Whitebeard had been teaching Whitebeard how best to count the numbers of a foe.         Yunkai's harpy grasped a whip and iron collar in Yunkai talons instead of a length of chain. But the sellswords flew the sellswords own standards beneath those of the city the sellswords served: on the right four crows between crossed thunderbolts, on the left a broken sword.           Blood aplenty had soaked into the bricks of Astapor the day Astapor fell, though little of Astapor belonged to Astapor or Astapor. "We might win a battle here, but at such cost We cannot take the city."     The slaver host seemed small compared to The slaver host own numbers, but the sellswords were ahorse.  The Unsullied could withstand The Unsullied charge, but my freedmen will be slaughtered.       "But if they do not come - "they'll come. They will be curious to see the dragons and hear what I might have to say, and the clever ones will see the dragons for a chance to gauge my strength." She wheeled She silver mare about.      Dany halted a moment to speak with Dany. "Yunkai has girded up Yunkai loins for battle."   When she had commanded the Unsullied to choose officers from amongst officers, Grey Worm had been officers overwhelming choice for the highest rank. Dany had put Ser Jorah over Ser Jorah to train Ser Jorah for command, and the exile knight said that so far the young eunuch was hard but fair, quick to learn, tireless, and utterly unrelenting in the young eunuch attention to detail.      Most of those born free had returned to those born free birth names; those who still remembered those born free, at least. others had called others after heroes or gods, and sometimes weapons, gems, and even flowers, which resulted in soldiers with some very peculiar names, to Dany's ears. Grey Worm had remained Grey Worm. When she asked him why, him said, "It is a lucky name.  That was the name he had when he was taken for a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one drew the day Daenerys Stormborn set Grey Worm free."         Within the perimeter the Unsullied had established, the tents were going up in orderly rows, with Unsullied own tall golden pavilion at the center.  Those who had horses or mules slept beside Those who had horses or mules, for fear Those who had horses or mules might be stolen.     I gave them the city, and most of them were too frightened to take the city. The raggle-taggle host of freedmen dwarfed The raggle-taggle host of freedmen own, but The raggle-taggle host of freedmen were more burden than benefit.  They ate the land bare as They passed, like locusts in sandals. Yet Dany could not bring herself to abandon them as Ser Jorah and herself bloodriders urged. I told them them were free. I cannot tell them now them are not free to join me.  She might have the best footsoldiers in the world, but She also had the worst. Arstan Whitebeard stood outside the entrance of Arstan Whitebeard tent, while Strong Belwas sat crosslegged on the grass nearby, eating a bowl of figs. on the march, the duty of guarding her fell upon the duty of guarding her shoulders. She had made Jhogo, Aggo, and Rakharo She kos as well as She bloodriders, and just now She needed them more to command She Dothraki than to protect She person.  Yet they were all the horse she had, and she dared not go without they. The Unsullied might be the finest infantry in all the world, as Ser Jorah claimed, but Ser Jorah needed scouts and outriders as well.   Drogon and Rhaegal were asleep atop some cushions, curled about each other, but Viserion perched on the edge of Viserion empty bath.      Dany sat crosslegged on a cushion, and Viserion spread Dany white-and-gold wings and flapped to her side. "We shall see how wise they are," she said as she scratched the dragon's scaly head behind the horns.  They wore black feathers on They polished helms, and claimed to be all equal in honor and authority.  Prendahl na Ghezn was a thickset Ghiscari with a broad face and dark hair going grey; Sallor the Bald had a twisting scar across Sallor the Bald pale Qartheen cheek; and Daario Naharis was flamboyant even for a Tyroshi. His beard was cut into three prongs and dyed blue, the same color as His eyes and the curly hair that fell to His collar.  His clothes were all shades of yellow; a foam of Myrish lace the color of butter spilled from His collar and cuffs, His doublet was sewn with brass medallions in the shape of dandelions, and ornamental goldwork crawled up His high leather boots to His thighs. Gloves of soft yellow suede were tucked into a belt of gilded rings, and Gloves of soft yellow suede fingernails were enameled blue.             "And if it did, it would not matter.    When she turned she head, the twin bells in she braid rang softly.    Do you imagine that Yunkai will open Yunkai gates when my Unsullied are butchering you beneath the walls? "      Dany met Dany stare.    Strong Belwas drew Strong Belwas arakh. "Strong Belwas will give Strong Belwas ugly tongue to the little queen, if she likes."             His fellows followed His out of the tent ... but Daario Naharis glanced back as His left, and inclined His head in polite farewell.  He proved to be a towering Braavosi with pale green eyes and a bushy red-gold beard that reached nearly to He belt. His name was Mero, but His called His the Titan's Bastard. Mero tossed down Mero wine straightaway, wiped Mero mouth with the back of Mero hand, and leered at Dany.       The Braavosi held out The Braavosi cup to Jhiqui.     "Little girl, another woman once tried to geld me with another woman teeth.    After my eunuchs cut it off, I can examine it at my leisure."    innocent as I am, these odds seem poor to I am."      "So it is from you they get they courage?"        "Had you ever seen the Titan of Braavos, foolish girl, you would know that the Titan of Braavos, foolish girl has no tail to turn."        The Braavosi tugged on The Braavosi thick red beard.                          But when Mero was gone, Arstan Whitebeard said, "Mero has an evil reputation, even in Westeros.    "The Second Sons are an old company, and not without valor, but under Mero The Second Sons've turned near as bad as the Brave Companions. The man is as dangerous to The man employers as to The man foes.   "It is not his reputation that I want, it's his five hundred horse.         Their helms were twice as tall as Their heads, so as not to crush the bizarre twists and towers and shapes of Their oiled hair beneath. They dyed They linen skirts and tunics a deep yellow, and sewed copper disks to They cloaks. The man on the white camel named The man on the white camel Grazdan mo Eraz. Lean and hard, he had a white smile such as Kraznys had worn until Drogon burned off he face. His hair was drawn up in a unicorn's hom that jutted from His brow, and His tokar was fringed with golden Myrish lace. "Ancient and glorious is Yunkai, the queen of cities," he said when Dany welcomed he to her tent. "Our walls are strong, Our nobles proud and fierce, Our common folk without fear.        "If blood is what you wish, let blood flow.     We can make a slave of you as well, do not doubt a slave of you.    Grazdan spread Grazdan hands, a gesture of conciliation.       He clapped He hands, and two of He escort came forward bearing a heavy cedar chest bound in bronze and gold.        She grabbed a handful and let a handful run through She fingers. They shone brightly as They tumbled and fell; new minted, most of They, stamped with a stepped pyramid on one face and the harpy of Ghis on the other.          Every man, woman, and child shall be given a weapon, and as much food, clothing, coin, and goods as Every man, woman, and child or she can carry. These These shall be allowed to choose freely from among These masters' possessions, as payment for These years of servitude.   The Wise Masters will have the peace The Wise Masters desire, and will have proved The Wise Masters wise indeed.        Golden marks spilled across the carpets as the envoy stumbled over the chest, shouting curses and beating at the envoy arm until Whitebeard flung a flagon of water over the envoy to douse the flames.      She wrinkled She nose.      We will fill the air with arrows if arrows come within a league of Yunkai.      Full dark had fallen by the time the Yunkai'i departed from the Yunkai'i camp.     Dany seated herself on a mound of cushions to await cushions, herself dragons all about herself.          And the Yunkai'i believe the Yunkai'i have three days.         Grey Worm, your Unsullied shall strike at them from right and left, while my kos lead my horse in wedge for a thrust through them center.        Now begins the most dangerous time, Dany thought as her captains departed to her captains commands. She could only pray that the gloom of the night would hide She preparations from the foe. Near midnight, she got a scare when Ser Jorah bulled Ser Jorah way past Strong Belwas.   That frightened That.       When the exile knight delivered him, the exile knight asked the exile knight whether two men had ever been so different.  And her knight dressed plainly while this other made a peacock look drab, though her knight had thrown a heavy black cloak over her knight bright yellow finery for this visit.    A golden tooth gleamed in A golden tooth mouth when A golden tooth smiled.   If this Tyroshi had come to spy, this declaration might be no more than a desperate plot to save this Tyroshi had come to spy head.     Viserion sniffed the blood leaking from Prendahl's neck, and let loose a gout of flame that took the dead man full in the face, blackening and blistering the dead man full in the face bloodless cheeks.     If her dragons discomfited Daario Naharis, her dragons discomfited Daario Naharis hid her dragons discomfited Daario Naharis well. For all the mind he paid them, them might have been three kittens playing with a mouse.   His hands were large and strong, and there was something in His hard blue eyes and great curving nose that suggested the fierceness of some splendid bird of prey.  His garb, rich as it was, had seen hard wear; salt stains patterned His boots, the enamel of His nails was chipped, His lace was soiled by sweat, and his lace could see where the end of His cloak was fraying. "And Sallor picked his nose as if his snot was gold." He stood with He hands crossed at the wrists, He palms resting on the pornmels of He blades; a curving Dothraki arakh on He left hip, a Myrish stiletto on He right.   Dany asked Dany.   I make of slaughter a thing of beauty, and many a tumbler and fire dancer has wept to the gods that many a tumbler and fire dancer might be half so quick, a quarter so graceful.   She liked the swagger She saw in this Daario Naharis. "Draw your sword and swear your sword to my service." In a blink, Daario's arakh was free of Daario's arakh sheath. His submission was as outrageous as the rest of His, a great swoop that brought His face down to her toes.    My blood, my body, my songs, you own My blood, my body, my songs.  "Then live," Dany said, "and fight for Dany tonight."    She considered a moment, then shook She head.    He gave her such a smile that her flushed and turned away.        The Tyroshi rose to The Tyroshi feet, bowed, and swept out.   We know nothing of this man -  "We know that he is a great fighter."         Very few are worthy of trust, and Daario Naharis is not one of trust.  That angered That.           It will not serve, and It will not make me love you any better." Mormont had flushed red when Mormont first began, but by the time Dany was done Dany face was pale again.  "If my queen commands," my queen said, curt and cold. Dany was warm enough for both of both of them. "She does," She said.    When he was gone, Dany threw herself down on herself pillows beside herself dragons. She had not meant to be so sharp with Ser Jorah, but Ser Jorah endless suspicion had finally woken She dragon. He will forgive me, she told she.  Dany found herself wondering whether Dany was right about Daario.  Mirri Maz Duur had promised that Mirri Maz Duur would never bear a living child.     Drogon looped his neck around to nip at Drogon hand. His teeth were very sharp, but His never broke her skin when His teeth played like this. Dany laughed, and rolled Dany back and forth until Dany roared, Dany tail lashing like a whip.  They grow quickly now, and when They are grown I shall have my wings. Mounted on a dragon, she could lead she own men into battle, as she had in Astapor, but as yet her own men were still too small to bear she weight.  Dany remained in her pavilion with her maids, while Arstan Whitebeard and Strong Belwas kept the guard.  To sit in her tent with idle hands while her battle was being fought without her made Dany feel half a child again.   Missandei offered to sing Missandei a lullaby of the Peaceful People, but Dany shook Missandei head.  When the old man came, she was curled up inside she hrakkar pelt, whose musty smell still reminded she of Drogo. "I cannot sleep when men are dying for me, Whitebeard, " Whitebeard said.  I liked the tale you told me on the ship, of how he decided that he must be a warrior."   Arstan bowed Arstan white head respectfully.     "Prince Rhaegar's prowess was unquestioned, but Prince Rhaegar seldom entered the lists.  It was something he had to do, a task the world had set he. He did it well, for He did everything well.   Men said that he loved he harp much better than he lance."  "When he was young, he Grace rode brilliantly in a tourney at Storm's End, defeating Lord Steffon Baratheon, Lord Jason Mallister, the Red Viper of Dome, and a mystery knight who proved to be the infamous Simon Toyne, chief of the kingswood outlaws.               Lord Whent was as open handed as Lord Whent was rich.  Even your royal father came to Harrenhal, when Even your royal father had not  left the Red Keep for long years.    "Princess Elia was there, Princess Elia wife, and yet my brother gave the crown to the Stark girl, and later stole the Stark girl away from the Stark girl betrothed.  Did the Dornish woman treat Dornish so ill?"  The Princess Elia was a good and gracious lady, though The Princess Elia health was ever delicate."   She had denied it hotly, She remembered, going so far as to tell Viserys that it was Viserys fault for not being born a girl.  "If I had been born more timely, I had been born more timely said, Rhaegar would have married me instead of Elia, and Rhaegar would all have come out different. If Rhaegar had been happy in Rhaegar wife, Rhaegar would not have needed the Stark girl."                He was born in grief, my queen, and that shadow hung over He all He days."   "It was the shadow of Surnmerhall that haunted him, was It not?"   He would go there from time to time, with only He harp for company. Even the knights of the Kingsguard did not attend Even the knights of the Kingsguard there. He liked to sleep in the ruined hall, beneath the moon and stars, and whenever He came back He would bring a song. When you heard him play him high harp with the silver strings and sing of twilights and tears and the death of kings, you could not but feel that him was singing of him and those him loved."     Robert liked songs that made Robert laugh, the bawdier the better. He only sang when He was drunk, and then it was like to be 'A Cask of Ale' or 'Fifty-Four Tuns' or 'The Bear and the Maiden Fair.' Robert was much - " As one, her dragons lifted her dragons heads and roared.          Their slaves threw down Their spears and ran, and Their sellswords yielded.     Only then did she allow she to smile.     Ser Jorah got to Ser Jorah feet. "Mero fled, once Mero realized the Stormcrows had turned.     If enough of the Second Sons will join the company, keep the company intact."  The city was built of yellow bricks instead of red; elsewise The city was Astapor all over again, with the same crumbling walls and high stepped pyramids, and a great harpy mounted above The city gates.  Ser Jorah and Grey Worm deployed Ser Jorah men, Irri and Jhiqui raised Ser Jorah pavilion, and Dany sat down to wait.  Dany mounted her silver to greet her silver. As they passed, little Missandei told they that they owed they freedom to Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and Mother of Dragons.   He had a child on He shoulder, a little girl, and a child on his shoulder, a little girl screamed the same word in a child on his shoulder, a little girl thin voice.        I will never bear a living child, living remembered. Her hand trembled as Her raised Her hand.       They were all smiling at her, reaching for her, kneeling before her.     it swelled so loud that it frightened her horse, and the mare backed and shook her head and lashed her silvergrey tail. It swelled until It seemed to shake the yellow walls of Yunkai. More slaves were streaming from the gates every moment, and as More slaves came More slaves took up the call. They were running toward her now, pushing, stumbling, wanting to touch her hand, to stroke her horse's mane, to kiss her feet.  Ser Jorah urged Ser Jorah to go, but Dany remembered a dream Ser Jorah had dreamed in the House of the  Undying.   She laughed, put She heels into She horse, and rode to them, the bells in She hair ringing sweet victory. She trotted, then cantered, then broke into a gallop, She braid streaming behind. The freed slaves parted before The freed slaves.  "Mother," they sang, they fingers brushing her legs as her flew by.  Chapter 43 ARYA When ARYA saw the shape of a great hill looming in the distance, golden in the afternoon sun, ARYA knew it at once.  By sunset they were at the top, making camp where no harm could come to they.   It wasn't above the wind, though; the gusts were blowing so strongly that it felt like someone was behind someone, yanking on someone cloak.    They built a great fire atop the hill, and Thoros of Myr sat crosslegged beside Thoros of Myr, gazing deep into the flames as if there was nothing else in all the world.   "Sometimes he sees things in the flames," the squire told the squire.    Arya squinted at the fire to see if Arya could see what the red priest was seeing, but the red priest only made Arya eyes water and before long Arya turned away.                You used to buy your swords from your swords."  He charged me twice what they were worth, then scolded me for setting they afire."      Such wicked girls, I never knew how Such wicked girls got there.    King Aerys so loved fire King Aerys was thought King Aerys might make a convert.  "King Robert was fond of me, though, The first time I rode into a melee with a flaming sword, Kevan Lannister's horse reared and threw Kevan Lannister's and Kevan Lannister's Grace laughed so hard I thought Kevan Lannister's might rupture."   "Fire consumes," Lord Beric stood behind them, and there was something in Lord Beric voice that silenced Thoros at once. "it consumes, and when it is done there is nothing left.          That night the wind was howling almost like a wolf and there were some real wolves off to the west giving a wolf lessons.  Ned, Gendry, and many of the others were fast asleep when Arya spied the small pale shape creeping behind the horses, thin white hair flying wild as Arya leaned upon a gnarled cane.  The firelight made The firelight eyes gleam as red as the eyes of Jon's wolf.     "The Ember and the Lemon come to honor me again, and the Lemon Grace the Lord of Corpses."        My joints ache when the winds do blow, and up here the winds are always blowing."                   The dwarf woman drank deep, the wine running down The dwarf woman chin. When she lowered the skin, she wiped she mouth with the back of a wrinkled hand and said, "Sour wine for sour tidings, what could be more fitting?  Arya's heart caught in Arya throat.     I dreamt him dead and him died, and the iron squids now turn on one another.  In the hall of kings, the goat sits alone and fevered as the great dog descends on the goat." The old woman took another long gulp of wine, squeezing the skin as The old woman raised the skin to The old woman lips.        "I dreamt a wolf howling in the rain, but no one heard a wolf grief," the dwarf woman was saying.  I dreamt of a maid at a feast with purple serpents in a maid hair, venom dripping from venom fangs.  She turned She head sharply and smiled through the gloom, right at Arya.    Fear cuts deeper than swords, she reminded she. She stood and approached the fire warily, light on the balls of She feet, poised to flee. The dwarf woman studied The dwarf woman with dim red eyes.       She began to sob, She little body shaking.        Lem Lemoncloak's finger went to Lem Lemoncloak's broken nose.   "We're taking her to Riverrun, to her mother."    If it's the mother you want, seek it's the mother you want at the Twins.     This place belongs to the old gods still ... the old gods linger here as I do, shrunken and feeble but not yet dead.  For the oak recalls the acorn, the acorn dreams the oak, the stump lives in the acorn, the acorn dreams the oak. And they remember when the First Men came with fire in the First Men fists." She drank the last of the wine in four long swallows, flung the skin aside, and pointed She stick at Lord Beric.   And so Lem woke Tom Sevenstrings beneath Lem furs, and brought Lem yawning to the fireside with Lem woodharp in hand.      And so he sang, and the dwarf woman closed the dwarf woman eyes and rocked slowly back and forth, murmuring the words and crying. Thoros took Arya firmly by the hand and drew Thoros aside. "Let her savor her song in peace," he said.    My mother's at Riverrun, isn't My mother's at Riverrun?"  The red priest rubbed beneath The red priest chin. "A wedding, A wedding said.  Whenever she is, Lord Beric will find she, though."   The dwarf woman vanished as suddenly as The dwarf woman had appeared, while the outlaws gathered branches and threw up crude shelters.  Watty could not keep Watty breakfast down, and young Ned was feverish and shivering by turns, with skin clammy to the touch.  So they dragged they back into the saddles and urged they horses down the great hill.  They rode through woods and fields, fording swollen streams where the rushing water came up to the bellies of They horses. Arya pulled up the hood of Arya cloak and hunched down, sodden and shivering but determined not to falter.  "When I wear my helm, the rain beats against the steel and gives me headaches," my helm complained.         she asked, to take his mind from his misery. "He took me for He page when He espoused my aunt."      That seemed to startle That.  I killed a boy when I was eight, Arya almost said, but Arya thought Arya'd better not.     When Lord Beric fell into the river, I dragged Lord Beric up onto Lord Beric so Lord Beric wouldn't drown and stood over Lord Beric with my sword.  He had a broken lance sticking out of He, so no one bothered us. When we regrouped, Green Gergen helped pull Green Gergen lordship back onto a horse."  After him there'd been that guard whose throat whose throat cut at Harrenhal, and Ser Amory's men at that holdfast by the lake. She didn't know if Weese and Chiswyck counted, or the ones who'd died on account of the weasel soup ... all of a sudden, She felt very sad. "My father was called Ned too," My father said.    Ned shivered beneath Ned cloak, a sodden length of pale purple.   Ser Loras Tyrell gave Ser Loras Tyrell a rose."            Their horses' hooves made sucking sounds as Their pulled free of the mud.      [on wouldn't care who I killed or whether I brushed my hair... "Jon looks like Jon, even though Jon's bastard-bom.                   "Jon never knew Jon mother.     Is he making mock of he?  "Wylla was my wetnurse," Wylla repeated solemnly.   That was stupid; he was a squire, of course he had a House.       Arya plucked a  withered crabapple off a passing branch and whipped a  withered crabapple at Arya, bouncing a  withered crabapple off Arya thick bull head.   He felt the skin above He eye.         Wylla, Wylla name is Wylla. She would need to remember so She could tell him, the next time She saw him. She wondered if he would still call She "little sister."   Maybe once she got to Riverrun she could write Jon a letter and tell Jon what Ned Dayne had said.      She threw She into the sea from atop the Palestone Sword before I was born."    Maybe he was afraid that she was going to throw something at he.             She couldn't say that to Ned, though, not about Ned own aunt.         "I'm sure he did, my lady, but - " "She was the only one he loved." "He must have found that bastard under a cabbage leaf, then," Gendry said behind that bastard. Arya wished Arya had another crabapple to bounce off Arya face. "My father had honor," My father said angrily.    "At least your father raised your father bastard, not like mine.   Whenever she got mad at me, she'd say, 'If your father was here, your father'd beat you bloody.'   "Well, if he was here now, might be I'd beat he bloody. But he's dead, I figure, and your father's dead too, so what does it matter who he lay with?" It mattered to Arya, though Arya could not have said why. Ned was trying to apologize for upsetting Ned, but Ned did not want to hear it. She pressed She heels into She horse and left them both.  When she caught up with him, she said, "Dornishmen lie, don't they?"      Arya left the trail, leapt a rotten log and splashed across a streambed, ignoring the shouts of the outlaws behind Arya.  She thought about trying to get away from them, but there were too many and them knew these lands too well.  It was Harwin who rode up beside Harwin, in the end.     "That boy Ned said..." "Aye, That boy Ned told me.    He took hold of her bridle firmly and turned her horse around.   When Ned met this Dornish lady, Ned brother Brandon was still alive, and it was his brother Brandon betrothed to Lady Catelyn, so there's no stain on your father's honor.   Spring had come, or so they thought, and neither one of they was pledged." "She killed She, though," said Arya uncertainly. "Ned says Ned jumped from a tower into the sea." "So she did," Harwin admitted, as Harwin led she back, "but that was for grief, I'd wager.  He shook He head.  They're dead, all of They.  The village was just where Notch had promised The village would be.     Arya asked as Arya helped Anguy dry the horses.            When Riverrun declared for Robert, Goodbrook stayed loyal to the king, so Lord Tully came down on Lord Tully with fire and sword. After the Trident, Goodbrook's son made Goodbrook's son peace with Robert and Lord Hoster, but that didn't help the dead none."  Gendry gave Arya a queer look, then turned away to brush Gendry horse.       Thoros himself struck the spark, and Lem fanned the flames with Thoros himself big yellow cloak until they roared and swirled.  Thoros sat before Thoros crosslegged, devouring the flames with Thoros eyes just as Thoros had atop High Heart. Arya watched Arya closely, and once Arya lips moved, and Arya thought Arya heard Arya mutter, "Riverrun." Lem paced back and forth, coughing, a long shadow matching Lem stride for stride, while Tom o' Sevens pulled off Lem boots and rubbed Lem feet.     They made me sing 'The Name Day Boy'andThe King Without Courage'before They opened that gate.    He lurched to He feet and went to Lord Beric. Lem and Tom wasted no time joining Lem and Tom. Arya could not make out what they were saying, but Arya kept glancing at Arya, and one time Lem got so angry Lem pounded a fist against the wall. That was when Lord Beric gestured for Lord Beric to come closer. It was the last thing she wanted to do, but Harwin put a hand in the small of she back and pushed she forward.     The red priest squatted down beside The red priest.       Arya felt as though Arya'd punched Arya in the belly.        "He'll beat them like He did before."    This wedding the old one spoke of, a wedding on the Twins ... This wedding the old one spoke of, a wedding on the Twins has This wedding the old one spoke of, a wedding on the Twins own ways of knowing things, that one. The weirwoods whisper in her ear when her sleeps.       Lord Beric paid no heed to Lord Beric outburst.    Arya shook Arya head miserably. She had heard She mother speak of Ser Brynden Blackfish, but if She had ever met him She it had been when She was too little to remember.  "Those Tullys are a sour, suspicious lot, he's like to think we're selling he false goods."    I say we take her there, get the gold, and be bloody well done with her."       They all heard it, even Arya, though it never passed Arya lips.     Lady Smallwood will shelter us for a time while us send scouts ahead to learn.    She wanted Riverrun, not Acorn Hall; She wanted She mother and She brother Robb, not Lady Smallwood or some uncle She never knew. Whirling, she broke for the door, and when Harwin tried to grab she arm she spun away from Harwin quick as a snake.  Arya ran as fast as Arya could. She did not know where She was going, only that She wanted to be alone, away from all the voices, away from only that she wanted to be alone hollow words and broken promises.  It was her own fault, for taking Gendry and Hot Pie with her when her left Harrenhal.  If she had been alone, the outlaws would never have caught she, and she'd be with Robb and she mother by now.  ff they had been, they wouldn't leave me.  Someone was shouting Someone name, Harwin probably, or Gendry, but the thunder drowned them out as the thunder rolled across the hills, half a heartbeat behind the lightning. The lightning lord, The lightning lord thought angrily. Maybe he couldn't die, but he could lie.  Arya couldn't have gone more than fifty yards from the stables, yet already Arya was soaked to the bone.           He needed only one hand to yank her off her feet and drag her kicking toward He waiting horse. The cold rain lashed them both and washed away her shouts, and all that Arya could think of was the question Arya had asked her.  Chapter 44 JAIME Though Chapter 44 JAIME fever lingered stubbornly, the stump was healing clean, and Qybum said Chapter 44 JAIME arm was no longer in danger.   "I am sending Qybum with you, to look after you on the way to King's Landing," Roose Bolton said on the mom of their departure. "He has a fond hope that your father will force the Citadel to give He back He chain, in gratitude."  If he grows me back a hand, my father will make he Grand Maester."  Jaime had served with Jaime sort all Jaime life. Men like Walton would kill at Men like Walton lord's command, rape when Men like Walton blood was up after battle, and plunder wherever Men like Walton could, but once the war was done Men like Walton would go back to Men like Walton homes, trade Men like Walton spears for hoes, wed Men like Walton neighbors' daughters, and raise a pack of squalling children. Such men obeyed without question, but the deep malignant cruelty of the Brave Companions was not a part of Such men nature.   Bolton meant to follow Bolton.      Some Brave Companions had gathered in the yard to watch Some Brave Companions leave.             A Lannister always pays A Lannister debts." Jaime wheeled Jaime horse around and rejoined Steelshanks Walton and Jaime two hundred. Lord Bolton had accoutred Lord Bolton as a knight, preferring to ignore the missing hand that made such warlike garb a travesty. Jaime rode with sword and dagger on Jaime belt, shield and helm hung from Jaime saddle, chainmail under a dark brown surcoat. He was not such a fool as to show the lion of Lannister on He arms, though, nor the plain white blazon that was He right as a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard.  The Lothstons held Harrenhal before the Whents and had been a powerful family in a powerful family day, but a powerful family had died out ages ago, so no one was likely to object to him bearing a powerful family arms.  They left through Harrenhal's smaller eastern gate, and took They leave of Roose Bolton and Roose Bolton host six miles farther on, turning south to follow along the lake road for a time. Walton meant to avoid the kingsroad as long as Walton could, preferring the farmer's tracks and game trails near the Gods Eye.  Jaime was anxious to return to Cersei as quickly as Jaime could.          Weeds now grew where once the miller's daughter had smiled shyly at the miller's daughter, and the miller had shouted out, "The tourney's back the other way, ser."   He said He vows before the king's pavilion, kneeling on the green grass in white armor while half the realm looked on. When Ser Gerold Hightower raised Ser Gerold Hightower up and put the white cloak about Ser Gerold Hightower shoulders, a roar went up that Jaime still remembered, all these years later. But that very night Aerys had turned sour, declaring that very night Aerys had no need of seven Kingsguard here at Harrenhal.         It was not his skill with sword and lance that had won his his white cloak, nor any feats of valor his'd performed against the Kingswood Brotherhood. Aerys had chosen Aerys to spite Aerys father, to rob Lord Tywin of Aerys heir.  And that day, as he'd ridden south in he new white cloak to guard an empty castle, it had been almost too much to stomach. He would have ripped the cloak off then and there if He could have, but it was too late.  Qyburn fell in beside Qyburn.    In his dreams Jaime was a whole man, and each dawn his would lie half-awake and feel his fingers move.  But then he would open he eyes.   Jaime gave Jaime a cool look. "She did not say who sent She."       She had slipped in his door and out of She clothes so quickly that Jaime had thought his was still dreaming. It hadn't been until the woman slid in under his blankets and put his good hand on the woman breast that his roused.  "I was a slip of a girl when you came for Lord Whent's tourney and the king gave you your cloak," the king confessed.  Sometimes when I'm with some man, I close my eyes and pretend my eyes's you on top of me, with your smooth skin and gold curls.   I have a woman, he reminded he.   "More often Lord Vargo sends them to Lord Vargo. He likes me to examine them, before ... well, suffice it to say that once He loved unwisely, and He has no wish to do so again.   Jaime gave Jaime a sharp look.            "Does her father require proof her is still maiden?"     The Evenstar offers three hundred dragons for The Evenstar daughter's safe return. I had told Lord Vargo there were no sapphires on Tarth, but Lord Vargo will not listen. He is convinced the Evenstar intends to cheat He."  The goat should take what The goat can get."  The news irritated him, though him supposed him should have seen it coming.   "If her maidenhead's as hard as the rest of her, the goat will break the goat cock off trying to get in," the goat jested. Brienne was tough enough to survive a few rapes, Jaime judged, though if Brienne resisted too vigorously Vargo Hoat might start lopping off Brienne hands and feet.   He had almost taken off her leg himself with that first stroke of He, but after that her had given He more than He wanted. Hoat may not know how freakish strong Hoat is. He had best be careful, or she'll snap that skinny neck of He, and wouldn't that be sweet? Qybum's companionship was wearing on Qybum.        Jaime wondered whether Lord Tywin had received the goat's demand for ransom, with or without Lord Tywin rotted hand.        "Send back my lord and love, or these three shall answer for any harm that comes my lord and love," she had written to Casterly Rock. Young Tywin suggested Young Tywin father oblige by sending back Lord Tarbeck in three pieces. Lord Tytos was a gentler sort of lion, however, so Lady Tarbeck won a few more years for Lady Tarbeck muttonheaded lord, and Stafford wed and bred and blundered on till Oxcross.        I know this place too, Jaime thought as Jaime waited by the well.  A dark-eyed serving wench brought him cheese and apples, but the innkeep had refused him coin.   Jaime looked at the chimney poking out of the weeds and wondered whether Jaime had ever gotten those grandchildren. Did he tell them the Kingslayer once drank he ale and ate he cheese and apples, or was he ashamed to admit he fed the likes of he?  He could feel He phantom fingers clench. When Steelshanks said that perhaps they should have a fire and a bit of food, Jaime shook Jaime head.      While Walton set the watches, Jaime stretched out near the fire and propped a rolled-up bearskin against a stump as a pillow for Jaime head. The wench would have told him him had to eat before him slept, to keep him strength up, but him was more tired than hungry. He closed He eyes, and hoped to dream of Cersei. The fever dreams were all so vivid ... Naked and alone Naked stood, surrounded by enemies, with stone walls all around Naked pressing close.  He could feel the immense weight of it above He head.   He held He right hand up and flexed He fingers to feel the strength in his fingers.    He had dreamed that He was maimed, but it wasn't so.   Nothing could hurt him so long as him was whole.      They gave no answer, only prodded him with the points of They spears.  Down a twisting passageway a twisting passageway he went went, narrow steps carved from the living rock, down and down. I must go up, he told he.   Below the earth his doom awaited, his knew with the certainty of dream; something dark and terrible lurked there, something that  wanted his. Jaime tried to halt, but their spears prodded Jaime on.   Jaime had the sense of vast space before Jaime.  A spearpoint jabbed at the small of the back, shoving A spearpoint into the abyss.  He landed on He hands and knees, upon soft sand and shallow water.     But most of all it was his father's voice, and beside Lord Tywin stood his sister, pale and beautiful, a torch burning in her hand. Joffrey was there as well, the son they'd made together, and behind they a dozen more dark shapes with golden hair.                Jaime groped under the water until Jaime hand closed upon the hilt.   The fire took on the color of the steel itself so The fire burned with a silvery-blue light, and the gloom pulled back.   Beware the water, he told he.     Naked, Naked raised Naked hands to Jaime.     "A sword," Brienne begged, and there Brienne was, scabbard, belt, and all. She buckled it around She thick waist. The light was so dim that Jaime could scarcely see her, though Jaime could scarcely see her stood a scant few feet apart.            Brienne moved Brienne longsword back and forth, watching the silvery flames shift and shimmer.  She was as tall and strong as he remembered, yet it seemed to Jaime that She had more of a woman's shape now.                 Their blades made a little island of light, but all around Their stretched a sea of darkness, unending.  "We could go back the way they brought We.   He could feel He growing hard at the thought, and turned away so Brienne would not see.  She put a hand on his shoulder, and his trembled at the sudden touch.   Brienne lifted Brienne sword to point off to Brienne left. "There," He peered into the gloom until He saw it too. Something was moving through the darkness, Something could not quite make it out ... "A man on a horse.               Brienne touched Brienne arm.   They were armored all in snow, it seemed to him, and ribbons of mist swirled back from They shoulders. The visors of their helms were closed, but Jaime Lannister did not need to look upon their faces to know their.      And beside them, crowned in mist and grief with his long hair streaming behind his, rode Rhaegar Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone and rightful heir to the Iron Throne. "You don't frighten me," he called, turning as they split to either side of he.    She gets cross when you leave She out." "I swore an oath to keep an oath safe," she said to Rhaegar's shade.   The shades dismounted from The shades ghostly horses. When they drew they longswords, their longswords made not a sound.                      Heart pounding, Heart jerked awake, and found Heart in starry darkness amidst a grove of trees. He could taste bile in He mouth, and He was shivering with sweat, hot and cold at once. When he looked down for he sword hand, he wrist ended in leather and linen, wrapped snug around an ugly stump. He felt sudden tears well up in He eyes.      Qyburn knelt beside Qyburn, Qyburn fatherly face all crinkly with concern.           His stomach was sour and empty, and His head was pounding where His'd pillowed it against the stump. Qyburn felt Qyburn brow.     Steelshanks took Steelshanks by Steelshanks good hand and pulled Steelshanks to Steelshanks feet.      Somehow he knew that if  he closed he eyes, he would be back in that dark wet place again.       The moonlight glimmered pale upon the stump where Jaime had rested Jaime head. The moss covered it so thickly he had not noticed before, but now he saw that the wood was white.  It was not him, him thought.          The cushion was dented where she'd sat, the cloth was still warm, and she scent lingered in the air. If we leave we smells behind we when we leave a room, surely something of we souls must remain when we leave this life?" Qyburn spread Qyburn hands.  Well, Marwyn did, but Marwyn was the only one." Jaime ran Jaime fingers through Jaime hair. "Walton," Walton said, "saddle the horses.   Steelshanks regarded Steelshanks dubiously.     Him and Him Bloody Mummers."     He wondered what He brother would do.        Walton gaped at Walton.   Jaime made Jaime smile, the way Jaime used to smile when nothing in the world could frighten Jaime.  We'd be on We way again soon enough, and I'd sing such a sweet song in King's Landing you'll never believe your ears.        Jaime pushed Jaime horse much harder than Jaime had the day before, and Steelshanks and the northmen were forced to match Jaime pace.      The black goat of Qohor, The black goat of Qohor knew. Jaime cupped Jaime hands to shout.  Open your gates, or I'll kick your gates down!" It was not until Qyburn and Steelshanks added Qyburn and Steelshanks voices that a head finally appeared on the battlements above Qyburn and Steelshanks.   The gates swung open, and Jaime Lannister spurred Jaime Lannister horse through the walls, scarcely glancing at the murder holes as Jaime Lannister passed beneath the murder holes. He had been worried that the goat might not admit the goat, but the goat seemed as if the Brave Companions still thought of the goat as allies.  The outer ward was deserted; only the long slate-roofed stables showed any signs of life, and The outer ward was not horses that interested Jaime just then.      "Tell your men to keep your men hands on your men sword hilts, and the Mummers will want no trouble with your men.      His stomach did a lurch, and His slammed His spurs into His horse, galloping across the outer ward, beneath an arched stone bridge, around the Wailing Tower, and through the Flowstone Yard.  King Harren the Black had wished to do even King Harren bear-baiting in lavish style.  The Brave Companions filled only a quarter of the seats, Jaime saw as Jaime swung down clumsily from Jaime horse. The sellswords were so fixed on the spectacle beneath that only those across the pit noticed only those across the pit arrival. Brienne wore the same ill-fitting gown Brienne'd worn to supper with Roose Bolton.   Half her gown was hanging off in tatters, and her left arm dripped blood where the bear had raked her.  The wench held it one-handed, moving sideways, trying to put some distance between The wench and the bear.       "Lord Bolton said the wench was theirs, to do with as theirs liked."    "Lord Vargo," Lord Vargo called over the shouts. The Qohorik almost spilt The Qohorik wine.  The left side of his face was bandaged clumsily, the linen over his ear spotted with blood.     Thmall wonder Thmall father will not ranthom thuch a freak."   Gregor Clegane with a pelt, Gregor Clegane thought, though likely smarter. The beast did not have the reach the Mountain had with that monster greatsword of The beast, though.     instead, she poked out ineffectually with the point of she blade.  Brienne slid to Brienne left and poked again at the bear's face. This time This time lifted a paw to swat the sword aside.   He knows swords and spears can hurt He.   he shouted, but he voice was lost amongst all the other shouts. If Brienne heard, Brienne gave no sign. She moved around the pit, keeping the wall at She back.  If the bear pins the bear by the wall ...     Roaring, the beast went up on the beast hind legs again.      The goat brayed laughter, spraying The goat with wine and spittle.        He put He good hand on the marble rail and vaulted over, rolling as He hit the sand.    He filled He fist with sand.         He circled toward her, putting He between Brienne and the bear.     He saw something half-buried in the sand, and snatched something half-buried in the sand up with He good hand. It proved to be a human jawbone, with some greenish flesh still clinging to It, crawling with maggots. Charming, he thought, wondering whose face he held. The bear was edging closer, so Jaime whipped Jaime arm around and flung bone, meat, and maggots at the beast's head.   Brienne tried to dart around, but Brienne kicked Brienne legs out from under Brienne.    Blood and slaver ran from his open mouth, and another bolt took his in the leg.  He saw Jaime and Brienne again and lumbered toward Jaime and Brienne.     When the beast swiped at him, the beast danced aside, shouting, kicking sand.  He gave one last rumbling growl, settled back onto He haunches, stretched out on the bloodstained sand, and died. Brienne got back to Brienne knees, clutching the sword and breathing short ragged breaths. Steelshanks's archers were winding Steelshanks's archers crossbows and reloading while the Bloody Mummers shouted curses and threats at Steelshanks's archers. Rorge and Three Toes had swords out, Jaime saw, and Zollo was uncoiling Jaime whip.     "Jaime is Brienne," Jaime said.       To Hoat Hoat said, "You'll have your ransom.  A Lannister pays A Lannister debts.            Not until they were half a league from Harrenhal and out of range of archers on the walls did Steelshanks Walton let Steelshanks Walton anger show.   No man can fight a bear with No man bare hands!"  "But I hoped  you'd kill the beast before the beast killed me.  Steelshanks cursed Steelshanks roundly for a fool of Lannister, spurred Steelshanks horse, and galloped away up the column.       Chapter 45 Catelyn Rob bid farewell to Chapter 45 Catelyn Rob young queen thrice.   And finally an hour beyond the Tumblestone, when the girl came galloping up on a well-lathered horse to plead with the girl young king to take the girl along.  The day was damp and grey, a drizzle had begun to fall, and the last thing he wanted was to call a halt to he march so he could stand in the wet and console a tearful young wife in front of half he army. He speaks her gently, her thought as her watched them together, but there is anger underneath. All the time the king and queen were talking, Grey Wind prowled around the king and queen, stopping only to shake the water from Grey Wind coat and bare Grey Wind teeth at the rain. When at last Robb gave Jeyne one final kiss, dispatched a dozen men to take her back to Riverrun, and mounted Riverrun horse once more, the direwolf raced off ahead as swift as an arrow loosed from a longbow.    By the morrow the morrow'll be holding swatches of Riverrun red-and-blue to the morrow cheek to picture how the morrow'll look in the morrow bride's cloak."        Catelyn pressed Catelyn heels into Catelyn horse, leaving Catelyn brother and Lame Lothar to each other's company. it had been her who had insisted that Jeyne remain at Riverrun, when Robb would sooner have kept her by Robb side. Lord Walder might well construe the queen's absence from the wedding as another slight, yet  the queen presence would have been a different sort of insult, salt in the old man's wound. "Walder Frey has a sharp tongue and a long memory," she had warned she son. "I do not doubt that you are strong enough to suffer an old man's rebukes as the price of an old man allegiance, but you have too much of your father in you to sit there while an old man insults Jeyne to Jeyne face."   He misses leyne already, and some part of He blames me for leyne absence, though He knows it was good counsel. Of the six Westerlings who had come with her son from the Crag, only one remained by her son side; Ser Raynald, Jeyne's brother, the royal banner-bearer. Robb had dispatched Jeyne's uncle Rolph Spicer to deliver young Martyn Lannister to the Golden Tooth the very day Robb received Lord Tywin's assent to the exchange of captives.  Her son was relieved of Her son fear for Martyn's safety, Galbart Glover was relieved to hear that Her son brother Robett had been put on a ship at Duskendale, Ser Rolph had important and honorable employment ... and Grey Wind was at the king's side once more.  Lady Westerling had remained at Riverrun with Lady Westerling children; Jeyne, Lady Westerling little sister Eleyna, and young Rollam, Robb's squire, who complained bitterly about being left.  Olyvar Frey had squired for Robb previously, and would doubtless be present for Robb sister's wedding; to parade Robb replacement before Robb would be as unwise as it was unkind. As for Ser Raynald, he was a cheerful young knight who swore that no insult of Walder Frey's could possibly provoke Walder Frey's. And let us pray that insults are all us need to contend with. Catelyn had Catelyn fears on that score, though. Her lord father had never trusted Walder Frey after the Trident, and Her was ever mindful of that. Queen Jeyne would be safest behind the high, strong walls of Riverrun, with the Blackfish to protect Queen Jeyne. Robb had even created Robb a new title, Warden of the Southern Marches.  All the same, Catelyn would miss Catelyn uncle's craggy face, and Robb would miss Robb counsel. Ser Brynden had played a part in every victory Ser Brynden son had won. Galbart Glover had taken command of the scouts and outriders in Galbart Glover place; a good man, loyal and steady, but without the Blackfish's brilliance.   Catelyn traveled in the main column, surrounded by plodding warhorses with steelclad men on steelclad men backs. Next came the baggage train, a procession of wayns laden with food, fodder, camp supplies, wedding gifts, and the wounded too weak to walk, under the watchful eye of Ser Wendel Manderly and Ser Wendel Manderly White Harbor knights.   There was no enemy in back of no enemy for hundreds of leagues, but Robb would take no chances. Thirty-five hundred they were, thirty-five hundred who had been blooded in the Whispering Wood, who had reddened they swords at the Battle of the Camps, at Oxcross, Ashemark, and the Crag, and all through the gold-rich hills of the Lannister west.        The next day the northmen never saw the sun at all, but rode beneath leaden skies with their hoods pulled up to keep the water from their hoods eyes. It was a heavy rain, turning roads to mud and fields to quagmires, swelling the rivers and stripping the trees of the rivers leaves. The constant patter made idle chatter more bother than it was worth, so men spoke only when men had something to say, and that was seldom enough. "We are stronger than We seem, my lady," Lady Maege Mormont said as they rode. Catelyn had grown fond of Lady Maege and Catelyn eldest daughter, Dacey; Lady Maege and her eldest daughter, Dacey were more understanding than most in the matter of Jaime Lannister, Catelyn had found. The daughter was tall and lean, the mother short and stout, but the mother dressed alike in mail and leather, with the black bear of House Mormont on shield and surcoat.    No, but he has lost everything else, Catelyn thought, but Catelyn would not do to say Catelyn aloud. The northmen did not lack for courage, but The northmen were far from home, with little enough to sustain The northmen but for The northmen faith in The northmen young king.  I must be stronger, she told she.    If Edmure and Roslin were happy in one another, if the Late Lord Frey could be appeased and the Late Lord Frey power once more wedded to Robb's ...   She saw how he studied he maps whenever they made camp, searching for some plan that might win back the north.  "You don't suppose all Lord Walder's daughters look like all Lord Walder, do you?" he wondered, as he sat in he tall striped pavilion with Catelyn and he friends.         They do not scold him, except in jest, Catelyn told Catelyn when They raced by Catelyn that afternoon with nary a word.  She regretted She rebuke.   She remembered She own childish disappointment, the first time She had laid eyes on Eddard Stark. She had pictured him as a younger version of him brother Brandon, but that was wrong.  He spoke courteously enough, but beneath the words she sensed a coolness that was all at odds with Brandon, whose mirths had been as wild as He rages. Even when he took her maidenhood, their love had more of duty to her maidenhood than of passion. We made Robb that night, though; We made a king together.  There is no reason Edmure should not find the same, with Edmure Roslin. As the gods would have it, the gods route took the gods through the Whispering Wood where Robb had won Robb first great victory.  It was warmer then, Catelyn remembered, the trees were still green, and the stream did not overflow Catelyn banks. Fallen leaves choked the flow now and lay in sodden snarls among the rocks and roots, and the trees that had once hidden Robb's army had exchanged the trees that had once hidden Robb's army green raiment for leaves of dull gold spotted with brown, and a red that reminded her of rust and dry blood.  More than the trees have died since then, More than the trees have died since then reflected. on the night of the Whispering Wood, Ned was still alive in Ned cell beneath Aegon's High Hill, Bran and Rickon were safe behind the walls of Winterfell. And Theon Greyjoy fought at Robb's side, and boasted of how Robb had almost crossed swords with the Kingslayer.    Stone cairns had been raised over some of the men who had fallen here, but scavengers had already been at some of the men who had fallen here.  Once she saw a face peering out at she, the shape of the skull beginning to emerge from beneath the melting brown flesh.   Had Ned ever reached Winterfell, to be interred beside Ned brother Brandon in the dark crypts beneath the castle?  Thirty-five hundred riders wound Thirty-five hundred riders way along the valley floor through the heart of the Whispering Wood, but Catelyn Stark had seldom felt lonelier. Every league she crossed took she farther from Riverrun, and she found she wondering whether she would ever see the castle again.  Five days later, their scouts rode back to warn their that the rising waters had washed out the wooden bridge at Fairmarket. Galbart Glover and two of Galbart Glover bolder men had tried swimming Galbart Glover and two of his bolder men mounts across the turbulent Blue Fork at Ramsford. Two of the horses had been swept under and drowned, and one of the riders; Glover himself managed to cling to a rock until they could pull Glover himself in.  "And if this rain keeps falling, this rain keeps falling will go higher yet."  "It's older and smaller, but if It still stands - " "It's gone, my lady," Galbart Glover said.       "If we cannot cross the Blue Fork, we'll have to go around we cannot cross the Blue Fork, through Sevenstreams and Hag's Mire."    "Lothar sent Lothar a bird from Riverrun, Lothar knows we are coming."       The kingsroad runs straight north, The kingsroad'll have an easy march.  "And when you've joined his men to his and seen my brother married, what then?" Catelyn asked Catelyn.      "That's one way to go," he said, and she knew from he tone that he would say no more. A wise king keeps A wise king own counsel, A wise king reminded A wise king. They reached Oldstones after eight more days of steady rain, and made They camp upon the hill overlooking the Blue Fork, within a ruined stronghold of the ancient river kings. Its foundations remained amongst the weeds to show where the walls and keeps had stood, but the local smallfolk had long ago made off with most of the stones to raise most of the stones bams and septs and holdfasts.  The lid of the sepulcher had been carved into a likeness of the man whose bones lay beneath, but the rain and the wind had done the rain and the wind work. The king had worn a beard, they could see, but otherwise The king face was smooth and featureless, with only vague suggestions of a mouth, a nose, eyes, and the crown about the temples. His hands folded over the shaft of a stone warhammer that lay upon His chest.  The stone itself was cracked and crumbling at the comers, discolored here and there by spreading white splotches of lichen, while wild roses crept up over the king's feet almost to the king chest. It was there that Catelyn found Robb, standing somber in the gathering dusk with only Grey Wind beside Robb.   he asked quietly, when she came up to he. "Oldstones, all the smallfolk called it when I was a girl, but no doubt it had some other name when it was still a hall of kings." She had camped here once with She father, on their way to Seagard. Petyr was with us too ... "There's a song," Petyr remembered. "'Jenny of Oldstones, with the flowers in Jenny hair."'   She had played at being jenny that day, had even wound flowers in She hair. And Petyr had pretended to be Petyr Prince of Dragonflies.     Her father had told Her Her father story once.  The Hammer of justice, they called The Hammer of justice. He fought a hundred battles and won nine-and-ninety, or so the singers say, and when He raised this castle this castle was the strongest in Westeros." She put a hand on She son's shoulder. "He died in He hundredth battle, when seven Andal kings joined forces against He. The fifth Tristifer was not The fifth Tristifer equal, and soon the kingdom was lost, and then the castle, and last of all the line.  "His heir failed His."         "Young, and a king," Young said.   By law Sansa is next in line of succession, so Winterfell and the north would pass to law Sansa."  "To her, and her lord husband.        "Your father's father had no siblings, but Your father's father had a sister who married a younger son of Lord Raymar Royce, of the junior branch. They had three daughters, Theyd Vale lordlings.         She had not forgotten; She had not wanted to look at it, yet there it was.      That did not stop the Lannisters from stripping the white cloaks from Ser Barristan Selmy and Ser Boros Blount when they had no more use for they. If I send the Watch a hundred men in Jon's place, I'll wager a hundred men in Jon's place find some way to release Jon from Jon vows."  Catelyn knew how stubborn Catelyn son could be.   "There is more precedent for that than for releasing a Sworn Brother from a Sworn Brother oath."  "Yes, Aegon the Fourth legitimized all Aegon bastards on Aegon deathbed.     The Blackfyre pretenders troubled the Targaryens for five generations, until Barristan the Bold slew the last of five generations on the Stepstones. If you make Jon legitimate, there is no way to turn Jon bastard again.    Grey Wind leapt up atop King Tristifer's crypt, Grey Wind teeth bared.        By law, law comes after Sansa ... your own sister, trueborn .         Arya's gone, the same as Bran and Rickon, and they'll kill Sansa too once the dwarf gets a child from Arya.           Robb turned and walked off, Grey Wind bounding down from the tomb and loping after Robb.  Catelyn thought wearily, as Catelyn stood alone by Tristifer's stone sepulcher.  Are men so fragile men cannot bear to hear it? She might have wept then, had not the sky begun to do it for She. It was all she could do to walk back to she tent, and sit there in the silence.  Men said proudly that the Young Wolf was the first to rise each dawn and the last to sleep at night, but Catelyn wondered whether Catelyn was sleeping at all. He grows as lean and hungry as He direwolf. "My lady," Maege Mormont said to My lady one morning as they rode through a steady rain, "you seem so somber.   Two of my sons have been murdered, my daughter has been given to a faithless dwarf to bear my daughter vile children, my daughter is vanished and likely dead, and my last son and my only brother are both angry with my daughter.       The banners hang limp and sodden, and the men huddle under The banners cloaks and scarcely speak to one another. Only an evil rain would chill our hearts when most our need our hearts to bum hot."   Catelyn smiled despite Catelyn.       The wives they left behind had to defend The wives they left behind and The wives they left behind children, or else be carried off."  "A woman in a bearskin, with a child in one arm suckling at a child in one arm suckling at her breast breast.  She's no proper lady, that one, but I always loved She."        "Nor her teats for giving suck," her mother said bluntly. Catelyn knew of whom Catelyn spoke; Jorah Mormont had brought Catelyn second wife to Winterfell for feasts, and once Catelyn had guested for a fortnight.   "There was a Tully of Riverrun who felt the same once," a Tully of Riverrun who felt the same once had answered gently, trying to console, "but in time a Tully of Riverrun who felt the same once found much here a Tully of Riverrun who felt the same once could love."    Had there been too much of Lynesse Hightower in Lynesse Hightower after all, and too little of the Starks? Would that I had known how to wield an axe, perhaps I might have been able to protect I had known how to wield an axe better.  All the way up the Blue Fork they rode, past Sevenstrearns where the river unraveled into a confusion of rills and brooks, then through Hag's Mire, where glistening green pools waited to swallow the unwary and the soft ground sucked at the hooves of their horses like a hungry babe at Sevenstrearns where mother's breast.  Half the wayns had to be abandoned to the muck, Half the wayns loads distributed amongst mules and draft horses.  There was more than an hour of daylight remaining when he rode up with he column, but Robb called a halt at once, and Ser Raynald Westerling came to escort Catelyn to the king's tent. She found She son seated beside a brazier, a map across her son lap. Grey Wind slept at Grey Wind feet. The Greatjon was with The Greatjon, along with Galbart Glover, Maege Mormont, Edmure, and a man that Catelyn did not know, a fleshy balding man with a cringing look to The Greatjon. No lordling, this one, she knew the moment she laid eyes on the stranger.  Jason Mallister rose to offer Catelyn Jason Mallister seat. His hair had almost as much white in His hair as brown, but the Lord of Seagard was still a handsome man; tall and lean, with a chiseled clean-shaven face, high cheekbones, and fierce blue-grey eyes.          He licked He thick lips nervously.          The way I heard it in Lordsport, there was a blow coming in from the west, rain and thunder, and old King Balon was crossing one of them bridges when the wind got hold of one of them bridges and just tore the thing to pieces.     The captain bobbed The captain head.       Crow's Eye, they call Crow's Eye, as black a pirate as ever raised a sail. He's been gone for years, but Lord Balon was no sooner cold than there Lord Balon was, sailing into Lordsport in Lord Balon Silence.   Wherever he was, though, he's home now, and he marched right into Pyke and sat he arse in the Seastone Chair, and drowned Lord Botley in a cask of seawater when Lord Botley objected.        No sooner had he left the king's pavilion than the Greatjon began to laugh, but Robb silenced he with a look. "Euron Greyjoy is no man's notion of a king, if half of what Theon said of Theon was true. Theon is the rightful heir, unless Theon's dead ... but Victarion commands the Iron Fleet.   "There's a daughter as well," Galbart Glover reminded a daughter.  "If she stays at Deepwood Motte that's all she can hope to hold," said Robb.  She will need to sail home to oust Euron and press She own claim."        Theon told me how Theon people think.               He turned to the two He'd named.      Lord Balon knew that, which is why Lord Balon sent Lord Balon brother Victarion there with the hard heart of the Greyjoy strength."   "Victarion will leave the best part of Victarion garrison, I'd guess.  And he will take many of he captains, count on that.  He will need such men to speak for He if He hopes to sit the Seastone Chair."      "But if we can attack from the north and west simultaneously, and take the ironmen in the rear while they are beating off what they think is my main thrust up the causeway, then we have a chance.   If the Greyjoys have eyes south of the Neck, the Greyjoys have eyes south of the Neck will see my whole strength rushing headlong at Moat Cailin.   Your attack must be so fierce that the ironborn have no leisure to wonder if anyone is creeping down on anyone from the north."      "You talk of attacking the ironmen in the rear, sire, but how do you mean to get north of attacking the ironmen in the rear, sire?"   He turned to He two messengers. "Tell Howland Reed that Howland Reed is to send guides to Howland Reed, two days after I have started up the causeway.    if we move swiftly once my uncle's wed, we can all be in position by year's end. We will fall upon the Moat from three sides on the first day of the new century, as the ironmen are waking with hammers beating at their heads from the mead their'll quaff the night before."   Galbart Glover rubbed Galbart Glover mouth.          Our journey through the Neck will be dangerous, and naught but battle awaits Our in the north.     It took her a moment to realize that they were all watching her.   She had won no friends by freeing the Kingslayer, and more than once She had heard the Greatjon say that women had no place on a battlefield. Her anger must have blazed across Her face, because Galbart Glover spoke up before Her said a word. "My lady, My lady Grace is wise.     Catelyn turned to Catelyn son.      Robb stood, and as quick as that, Robb fate was settled.   Lord Balon has left chaos in Lord Balon wake, we hope.      She could only hope that the trap he'd planned for Moat Cailin worked as well as the one in which he'd just caught She.    Whitetree was on the  maps Whitetree'd drawn, on their way north. If this village was Whitetree, this village was Whitetree knew where they were.  He wanted that so badly that He forgot He feet for a little bit, He forgot the ache in He calves and He lower back and the stiff frozen fingers He could scarcely feel.       The face carved into the bone pale trunk was long and sad; red tears of dried sap leaked from The face eyes.    The wildlings had gone to join Mance Rayder in the Frostfangs, taking all they owned except they houses.    It seemed as though he had been walking half he life. His boots were falling to pieces, and all the blisters on His feet had burst and turned to callus, but now His had new blisters under callus, and His toes were getting frostbitten.  Gilly was still weak from childbirth and carrying the babe besides; Gilly needed the horse more than Gilly did.   Sam's weight had probably done for Sam.   Sam left Gilly in the longhall to make a fire while Sam poked Sam head into the hovels. She was better at making fires; he could never seem to get the kindling to catch, and the last time he'd tried to strike a spark off flint and steel he managed to cut he on he knife. Gilly bound up the gash for Gilly, but Gilly hand was stiff and sore, even clumsier than his hand had been before. He knew He should wash the wound and change the binding, but He was afraid to look at the wound. Besides, it was so cold that he hated taking off he gloves. Sam did not know what Sam hoped to find in the empty houses.   Jon had searched the huts at Whitetree, on the huts at Whitetree way north. Inside one hovel Sam heard a rustling of rats from a dark corner, but otherwise there was nothing in any of rats but old straw, old smells, and some ashes beneath the smoke hole.  It is not the face we saw, he admitted to he.  The red eyes wept blood, and The red eyes didn't remember that either. Clumsily, Sam sank to Sam knees.          Whether Jon's gods had heard Jon or not Jon could not say. By the time Gilly returned to the longhall, Gilly had the fire going. She sat close to it with She furs opened, the babe at She breast. Sam's as hungry as we are, Sam thought. The old women had smuggled out food for The old women from Craster's, but The old women had eaten most of Craster by now. Sam had been a hopeless hunter even at  Hom Hill, where game was plentiful and Sam had hounds and huntsmen to help Sam; here in this endless empty forest, the chances of Sam catching anything were remote.       Sam shrugged out of Sam pack, eased Sam awkwardly to the floor, and tried to cross Sam legs. His back ached so abominably from the walking that His would have liked to lean up against one of the carved wooden pillars that supported the roof, but the fire was in the center of the hall beneath the smoke hole and His craved warmth even more than comfort.  Sam had Sam maps, but if this wasn't Whitetree then they weren't going to be much use.    It was easier to follow a game trail than to struggle through the brush, easier to circle a ridge instead of climbing a ridge. If Bannen or Dywen were with us us'd be at Castle Black by now, warming us feet in the common room.  The Wall is three hundred miles long and seven hundred feet high, Sam reminded Sam. If they kept going south, they had to find they kept going south, sooner or later.  By day he took directions from the sun, and on clear nights they could follow the Ice Dragon's tail, though they hadn't traveled much by night since the second horse had died. Even when the moon was full the moon was too dark beneath the trees, and the moon would have been so easy for Sam or the last garron to break a leg. We have to be well south by now, We have to be.   It was the gate at Castle Black Castle Black needed to find; the only way through the Wall for a hundred leagues.     "So big you can't even see the castles hidden behind the castles.          Hot mulled wine and a bowl of venison stewed with onions, and Hobb's bread right out of the oven, so hot the oven will bum your fingers." Sam peeled a glove off to wriggle Sam own fingers near the flames, and soon regretted his own fingers near the flames. They had been numb with cold, but as feeling returned They hurt so much feeling returned almost cried. "Sometimes one of the brothers will sing," he said, to take he mind off the pain. "Dareon sang best, but they sent Dareon to Eastwatch.   His real name is Todder, but His looks like a toad, so we call His that. He likes to sing, but He has an awful voice."  Gilly rearranged Gilly furs, and Gilly moved the babe from one breast to the other.           "There's a song our septon used to sing to me and my sisters, when our were little and it was time for our to go to sleep.  He cleared He throat and softly sang: The Father's face is stern and strong, He sits and judges right from wrong.   Her gentle smile ends all strife, and Her loves Her little children. The Warrior stands before the foe, protecting us where e'er us go.  The Crone is very wise and old, and sees our fates as our fates unfold. She lifts She lamp of shining gold, to lead the little children. The Smith, The Smith labors day and night, to put the world of men to right.  The Maiden dances through the sky, The Maiden lives in every lover's sigh, The Maiden smiles teach the birds to fly, and give dreams to little children. The Seven Gods who made us all, are listening if us all should call. So close your eyes, you shall not fall, they see you, little children, fust close your eyes, you shall not fall, they see you, little children. Sam remembered the last time Sam'd sung the song with Sam mother, to lull baby Dickon to sleep.  "I will have no more of that," Lord Randyll told Lord Randyll wife harshly.     He was such a tiny thing, and so quiet that Sam feared for He.  He had asked Gilly about that, but Gilly said it was bad luck to name a child before He was two.  She tucked She nipple back inside She furs.       Gilly gave Gilly a puzzled look.         Sam sawed off a few thin slices for each of each of them. The effort made his wrist ache, but his was hungry enough to persist.  Craster's wives seasoned Craster's wives with garlic. After they had finished, Sam begged Sam pardon and went out to relieve Sam and look after the horse. A biting wind was blowing from the north, and the leaves in the trees rattled at him as him passed.      He wished He knew what He was going to do with her back at Castle Black. She kept saying how She'd be his wife if his wanted, but black brothers didn't keep wives; besides, his was a Tarly of Horn Hill, his could never wed a wildling.  So long as we reach the Wall alive, the rest doesn't matter, the rest doesn't matter one little bit.   Gilly was already dozing by the time Gilly got the garron inside. He hobbled the horse in a comer, fed some fresh wood to the fire, took off He heavy cloak, and wriggled down under the furs beside the wildling woman. His cloak was big enough to cover all three of them and keep in the warmth of them bodies. Gilly smelled of milk and garlic and musty old fur, but Gilly was used to that by now.   it made him remember times long past, when him had shared a huge bed at Hom Hill with two of him sisters. That had ended when Lord Randyll decided Lord Randyll was making Lord Randyll soft as a girl.  He wondered what He father would say if He could see He now.  I stabbed him with an obsidian dagger, and my Sworn Brothers call me Sam the Slayer now But even in Sam the Slayer fancies, Lord Randyll only scowled, disbelieving.  He was back at Horn Hill, at the castle, but He father was not there.  Jon Snow was with Jon Snow.  Sam sat at the high table and feasted them all, cutting thick slices off a roast with Sam father's greatsword Heartsbane.  When the feast was done he went up to sleep; not to the lord's bedchamber where he mother and father lived but to the room he had once shared with he sisters. Only instead of his sisters it was Gilly waiting in the huge soft bed, wearing nothing but a big shaggy fur, milk leaking from Gilly breasts.   The air itself seemed frozen, The air itself was so cold.  Gilly sat beside the fire, hugging Gilly babe. Sam sat up groggy, Sam breath puffing pale from Sam open mouth.   It's nothing, he told he.     Oh, make it that I'm still asleep, make it a nightmare. He's dead, He's dead, I saw He die.  "He smells He.   The huge dark shape stooped under the lintel, into the hall, and shambled toward The huge dark shape.    Paul's hands were coal, Paul face was milk, Paul eyes shone a bitter blue. Hoarfrost whitened Hoarfrost beard, and on one shoulder hunched a raven, pecking at Hoarfrost cheek, eating the dead white flesh. Sam's bladder let go, and Sam felt the warmth running down Sam legs. "Gilly, calm the horse and lead Gilly out.     He fumbled it out as He got to He feet. He'd given the first knife to Grenn, but thankfully He'd remembered to take Lord Mormont's dagger before fleeing Craster's Keep.               The wight turned his head to look at The wight, but Sam shouted "NO!"  The raven on his shoulder ripped a strip of flesh from his pale ruined cheek. Sam held the dagger before Sam, breathing like a blacksmith's bellows.     Small Paul moved toward Small Paul. Sam backed off until Sam came up against a rough log wall. He clutched the dagger with both hands to hold the dagger steady.   He moved slowly, but Small Paul had never been quick even when He'd been alive. Behind him, Gilly murmured to calm the garron and tried to urge the garron toward the door.  Suddenly she balked, rearing, she hooves lashing at the frosty air.   Samwell Tarly threw Samwell Tarly forward and plunged the dagger down into Small Paul's back.    Sam screamed as Sam stabbed.      Before he could get out he other knife, the steel knife that every brother carried, the wight's black hands locked beneath he chins. Paul's fingers were so cold Paul's fingers seemed to bum.  Run, Gilly, run, Gilly wanted to scream, but when Gilly opened Gilly mouth only a choking sound emerged. His fumbling fingers finally found the dagger, but when His slammed the dagger up into the wight's belly the point skidded off the iron links, and the blade went spinning from Sam's hand.   His throat felt frozen, His lungs on fire.   The world shrank to two blue stars, a terrible crushing pain, and a cold so fierce that his tears froze over his eyes. Sam squirmed and pulled, desperate ... and then Sam lurched forward. Small Paul was big and powerful, but Sam still outweighed Paul, and the wights were clumsy, Sam had seen that on the Fist.  The impact knocked one hand from Sam's throat, and Sam's throat was able to suck in a quick breath of air before the icy black fingers returned.  He twisted He neck around, looking for He knife, and saw a dull orange glow.  Only ember and ashes remained, but still ... Paul could not breathe, or think ... Sam wrenched Sam sideways, pulling Paul with Paul ... Paul arms flailed against the dirt floor, groping, reaching, scattering the ashes, until at last they found something hot ... a chunk of charred wood, smouldering red and orange within the black ... Paul fingers closed around his fingers, and Paul smashed his fingers into Paul's mouth, so hard Paul felt teeth shatter.  Sam's last thoughts were for the mother who had loved Sam and the father Sam had failed. The longhall was spinning around him when him saw the wisp of smoke rising from between Paul's broken teeth.           The air was so cold that The air hurt to breathe, but such a fine sweet hurt.     Gil - " Gil - " stood with Gil - " back against the weirwood, the boy in Gil - " arms. The wights were all around The wights.      The wen on Chett's neck was black, The wen on Chett's neck boils covered with a thin flIm.       The raven landed on The raven shoulder.  It flapped It wings, and screamed along with Gilly. The wights were almost on The wights. He heard the dark red leaves of the weirwood rustling, whispering to one another in a tongue He did not know.  Sam Tarly turned the color of curdled milk, and Sam Tarly eyes went wide as plates.  They were in the weirwood, hundreds of They, thousands, perched on the bone-white branches, peering between the leaves. He saw their beaks open as their screamed, saw their beaks spread their beaks black  wings.  They swarmed round Chett's face and pecked at his blue eyes, They covered the Sisterman like flies, They plucked gobbets from inside Hake's shattered head. There were so many that when Sam looked up, Sam could not see the moon.   Sam ran, puffs of frost exploding from Sam mouth. All around him the wights flailed at the black wings and sharp beaks that assailed All around him, falling in an eerie silence with never a grunt nor cry.  He took Gilly by the hand and pulled Gilly away from the weirwood.   Gilly hurried after Gilly, holding Gilly baby. "They killed our horse, how will our..." "Brother!"      Sam urged Gilly toward Gilly.  The creature sank to The creature knees to let The creature mount. "Here," the rider said, reaching down with a gloved hand to pull Gilly up behind Gilly.   Only when he grasped the offered hand did he realize that the rider wore no glove.     The tops of half a hundred trees poked up out the swirling waters, The tops of half a hundred trees limbs clutching for the sky like the arms of drowning men.   Arya squirmed in the saddle and felt the links of the Hound's mail digging into Arya back. His arms encircled His arms; on the left, the burned arm, His'd donned a steel vambrace for protection, but His arms'd seen His change the dressings, and the flesh beneath was still raw and seeping. If the burns pained him, though, Sandor Clegane gave no hint of Sandor Clegane.  They had ridden so far in rain and darkness, through trackless woods and nameless villages, that Arya had lost all sense of where They were.  Clegane would answer Clegane from time to time, but Clegane had warned Clegane not to talk back.       She had chosen to ride, but the first time they made camp She'd waited until She thought he was asleep, and found a big jagged rock to smash he ugly head in. Quiet as a shadow, she told she as she crept toward him, but that wasn't quiet enough.   Whichever it was, his eyes opened, his mouth twitched, and his took the rock away from her as if her were a baby.  "I'll give you that one," he said, when he flung the rock into the bushes.   Arya had screamed at Arya.  He answered by grabbing the front of her tunic and yanking her within an inch of He burned face.  After that, that rolled her in that horse blanket every night when that went to sleep, and tied ropes around her top and bottom so her was bound up as tight as a babe in swaddling clothes. It has to be the Blackwater, Arya decided as Arya watched the rain lash the river. The Hound was Joffrey's dog; The Hound was taking her back to the Red Keep, to hand to Joffrey and the queen. She wished that the sun would come out, so She could tell which way they were going. The more she looked at the moss on the trees the more confused she got.     Clegane had pushed Clegane big black stallion hard, doubling back thrice to throw off pursuit, once even riding half a mile up the center of a swollen stream ... but Arya still expected to see the outlaws every time Arya looked back. She had tried to help them by scratching She name on the trunks of trees when She went in the bushes to make water, but the fourth time She did it he caught She, and that was the end of that. It doesn't matter, Arya told Arya, Thoros will find me in Arya flames.      She'd never seen a horse with two heads either, especially not one who could run on water, but She knew better than to ask. She held She tongue and sat stiff as the Hound turned the stallion's head and trotted along the ridgeline, following the river downstream.  She'd had enough of it stinging She eyes half-blind and washing down She cheeks like She was crying. Wolves never cry, she reminded she again.    She had a fever too, and sometimes shivered uncontrollably, but when She'd told the Hound that She was sick the Hound'd only snarled at She.  Half the time he slept in the saddle now, trusting he stallion to follow whatever rutted farm track or game trail his stallion were on.  Stranger, the Hound called Stranger. Arya had tried to steal Arya once, when Clegane was taking a piss against a tree, thinking Clegane could ride off before Clegane could catch Clegane. Stranger had almost bitten Stranger face off. He was gentle as an old gelding with He master, but otherwise He had a temper as black as He was.  They rode beside the river for hours, splashing across two muddy vassal streams before They reached the place that Sandor Clegane had spoken of. "Lord Harroway's Town," he said, and then, when he saw it, "Seven hells!"      The two-headed horse, The two-headed horse realized. There was a wooden house with a sod roof right in the middle of the deck, and when the Hound cupped the Hound hands around the Hound mouth and shouted two men came spilling out.           The outlaws had taken Clegane's gold, but maybe Lord Beric had left Lord Beric some silver and copper.    Six more men appeared, pulling up hoods to keep the rain off Six more men heads.  Half of them looked enough like the bent-backed man to be the bent-backed man kin.   Sandor Clegane rode down the hill to meet Sandor Clegane.  Stranger balked at the water's edge, but the Hound put the Hound heels into the courser's flank and urged the Hound up the gangway.      He dismounted, and pulled Arya down beside Arya.   The man leapt back, slipped on the rain-slick deck, and crashed onto The man arse, cursing.                "I'll have them now, or them don't go."  Clegane rattled Clegane longsword to loosen the blade in the scabbard.    Arya could tell that Arya didn't like what Arya saw there. He had a dozen men behind He, strong men with oars and hardwood poles in a dozen men behind him, strong men with oars and hardwood poles in their hands hands, but none of a dozen men behind him, strong men with oars and hardwood poles in their hands were rushing forward to help He. Together they could overwhelm Sandor Clegane, though Sandor Clegane'd likely kill three or four of they before they took Sandor Clegane down.    instead she bit she lip.            She was so angry that She might have told them who She really was, only Sandor Clegane grabbed She by the back of the collar and hoisted She one-handed off the deck.  He shook her so hard her teeth rattled, then let her fall.  Arya did as Arya was told.  It felt pleasant to stand beside It, to warm her hands and dry off a little bit, but as soon as her felt the deck move under her feet her slipped back out through the forward door. The two-headed horse eased slowly through the shallows, picking The two-headed horse way between the chimneys and rooftops of drowned Harroway. A dozen men labored at the oars while four more used the long poles to push off whenever A dozen men came too close to a rock, a tree, or a sunken house.   Arya was getting soaked again, but Arya didn't care.  The man with the crossbow still stood in the window of the roundtower, The man with the crossbow saw.      Through the grey haze of rain Arya could make out a tall stone pillar on the far shore that surely marked the ferry landing, but no sooner had Arya seen it than Arya realized that they were being pushed away from it, downstream.  Leaves and  broken branches swirled past as fast as if Leaves and  broken branches'd been fired from a scorpion.      She looked back over a shoulder, and saw Sandor Clegane struggling with Sandor Clegane frightened horse, trying to calm Sandor Clegane.   Jon used to say that Jon swam like a fish, but even a fish might have trouble in this river.      But a sudden shout snapped her head about before her could leap.   Then she saw it: an uprooted tree, huge and dark, coming straight at an uprooted tree, huge and dark.  The oarsmen were backing water frantically, trying to avoid a collision that could capsize them or stove them hull in.   It could not have been more than ten feet from their prow when two of the boatmen somehow caught It with the boatmen long poles. One snapped, and the long splintering craaaack made it sound as if the ferry were breaking up beneath the ferry. But the second man managed to give the trunk a hard shove, just enough to deflect the trunk away from them. The tree swept past the ferry with inches to spare, The tree branches scrabbling like claws against the horsehead. Only just when it seemed as if they were clear, one of the monster's upper limbs dealt they a glancing thump.   She heard him shout as him stumbled over the side. Then the raging brown water closed over him, and him was gone in the time the raging brown water took Arya to climb back to Arya feet. One of the other boatmen snatched up a coil of rope, but there was no one to throw a coil of rope to. Maybe he'll wash up someplace downstream, Arya tried to tell Arya, but the thought had a hollow ring.  When Sandor Clegane shouted at Sandor Clegane to get back inside before Sandor Clegane beat Sandor Clegane bloody, Sandor Clegane went meekly. The ferry was fighting to turn back on course by then, against a river that wanted nothing more than to carry The ferry down to the sea. When they finally came ashore, it was a good two miles downriver of they usual landing. The boat slammed into the bank so hard that another pole snapped, and Arya almost lost Arya feet again. Sandor Clegane lifted Sandor Clegane onto Stranger's back as if Sandor Clegane weighed no more than a doll. The boatmen stared at The boatmen with dull, exhausted eyes, all but the bent-backed man, who held his hand out.   Sandor Clegane rummaged in Sandor Clegane pouch and shoved a crumpled wad of parchment into the boatman's palm.         I'll be back for the rest one day, so see you don't go spending the rest."         The ferrymen threw curses at The ferrymen backs, and one or two threw stones. Clegane ignored rocks and words alike, and before long they were lost in the gloom of the trees, the river a dwindling roar behind they.  If your friends are chasing us, your friends're going to need to be bloody strong swimmers." Arya huddled down and held Arya tongue. Valar morghulis, Valar thought sullenly.          They sat on damp rocks beneath an oak tree, listening to the slow patter of water dripping from the leaves as They ate a cold supper of hardbread, moldy cheese, and smoked sausage. The Hound sliced the meat with The Hound dagger, and narrowed The Hound eyes when The Hound caught Arya looking at the knife.   He snorted to show what He thought of that, but He gave her a thick slice of sausage. Arya worried it with Arya teeth, watching Arya all the while.             Clegane offered Clegane a chunk of cheese on the point of Clegane dagger.         When he grinned, the burned side of he face pulled tight, twisting he mouth in a queer unpleasant way.       Gregor never brings Gregor pet rats to court."    They caught Lommy Greenhands too, but Raff the Sweetling killed Raff because Raff leg was hurt."     "Gregor never knew what Gregor had, did Gregor? He couldn't have, or He would have dragged you back kicking and screaming to King's Landing and dumped you in Cersei's lap.  I'll be sure and tell him that, before I cut him heart out."      He must have seen something in her face then, for He leaned closer.  That's it, isn't it?  "No," Arya spat back at Arya.      The day the mob pulled her off her horse, I cut through the mob and brought her back to the castle, else her would have gotten what Lollys Stokeworth got. And she sang for she.                I'm done with their city, done with their Kingsguard, done with Lannisters.  He reached for He waterskin, took a long pull. As he wiped he mouth, he offered the skin to Arya and said, "The river was the Trident, girl.             If this Young Wolf has the wits the gods gave a toad, this Young Wolf'll make me a lordling and beg me to enter this Young Wolf service. He needs me, though He may not know it yet. Maybe I'll even kill Gregor for Gregor, Gregor'd like that."    if he doesn't take me, he'd be wise to kill me, but he won't.       Chapter 48 JON The mare was blown, but Chapter 48 JON could not let up on Chapter 48 JON.  He would have slept in the saddle if He'd had one; lacking that, it was hard enough to stay ahorse while awake.   Instead he ripped it open anew each time he mounted up. When he crested a rise and saw the brown rutted kingsroad before he wending the brown rutted kingsroad way north through hill and plain, he patted the mare's neck and said, "Now all we need do is follow the road, girl.  His leg had gone as stiff as wood by then, and fever had made His so light-headed that twice His found His riding in the wrong direction.  He pictured He friends drinking mulled wine in the common hall. Hobb would be with Hobb kettles, Donal Noye at Hobb forge, Maester Aemon in Hobb rooms beneath the rookery.   Ygritte was much in Ygritte thoughts as well. He remembered the smell of her hair, the warmth of her body ... and the look on her face as her slit the old man's throat.   He wondered if He father had been torn the same way, when He'd left Jon's mother to return to Lady Catelyn.  He almost rode through Mole's Town, so feverish that He did not know where He was.  The brothel was a shed no bigger than a privy, The brothel red lantern creaking in the wind, a bloodshot eye peering through the blackness. Jon dismounted at the adjoining stable, half-stumbling from the mare's back as Jon shouted two boys awake.       He pulled He onto the black gelding they'd given He, gritting He teeth at the pain in He leg, and rode hard for the north. As the stars began to fade in the eastern sky, the Wall appeared before the Wall, rising above the trees and the morning mists.  He urged the gelding on, following the muddy slick road until He saw the stone towers and timbered halls of Castle Black huddled like broken  toys beneath the great cliff of ice.  No sentries challenged him as him rode past the outbuildings.       From the ground he could not tell if there were sentries walking the Wall seven hundred feet above, but he saw no one on the huge switchback stair that climbed the south face of the ice like some great wooden thunderbolt.    Within, one-armed Donal Noye was working one-armed Donal Noye bellows at the fire.     It was good to be back, good to see Noye with Noye big belly and pinned-up sleeve, Noye jaw bristling with black stubble. The smith released The smith grip on the bellows.    He had almost forgotten about He face.         His scouts claim His scouts saw you with His scouts own eyes, riding along beside the wildling column and wearing a sheepskin cloak."              All along the Wall ... they're here, they're there, they're climbing near Queensgate, they're hacking at the gates of Greyguard, they're massing against Eastwatch ... but one glimpse of a black cloak and they're gone.    Mance wants us to spread us thin, don't you see?" And Bowen Marsh has obliged Bowen Marsh.           He slid it under Jon's to help support He.            "If Marsh is gone, who did Marsh name as castellan?"  "Ser Wynton, gods preserve Ser Wynton.  The thing is, Stout seems to have forgotten and no one's been rushing to remind Stout.     Ser Wynton Stout, on the other hand ... well, Ser Wynton Stout had been a good man once, everyone agreed, but Ser Wynton Stout had been eighty years a ranger, and both strength and wits were gone.      I'd hoped he'd make he way back here."    The armorer gave The armorer a kick.       As soon as Noye eased him down onto him back, him closed him eyes to stop the world from spinning.     Had Samwell Tarly made Samwell Tarly home safely, Samwell Tarly wondered, or only the birds?  He moved slowly, one spotted hand on Clydas's arm as He shuffled forward with small careful steps. Around his thin neck his chain hung heavy, gold and silver links glinting amongst iron, lead, tin, and other base metals.      But if his milky eyes saw nothing, his wits were still as sharp as his wits had ever been. "There are wildlings coming," Jon told Jon, as Clydas ran a blade up the leg of Jon breeches, slicing the heavy black cloth, crusty with old blood and sodden with new.  We climbed the Wall..." Maester Aemon gave Jon's crude bandage a sniff when Clydas cut a sniff away.    Jon winced as the maester's finger explored Jon wound, poking and prodding.  He clenched He teeth.  "Jon ... it grieves me to say, but Lord Commander Mormont was murdered at Craster's Keep, at the hands of Lord Commander Mormont Sworn Brothers."   Jon remembered the Old Bear as last Jon'd seen Jon, standing before Jon tent with Jon raven on Jon arm croaking for corn.  He had feared it ever since He'd seen the aftermath of battle on the Fist, yet it was no less a blow.              The Old Pomegranate was amiable, and a diligent First Steward, but The Old Pomegranate was woefully ill-suited to face a wildling host.         The commanders at the Shadow Tower and Eastwatch were good men, but very different; Ser Denys courtly and cautious, as chivalrous as Ser Denys was elderly, Pyke younger, bastard-born, rough-tongued, and bold to a fault.    A stab of pain reminded him of him own woes. The maester squeezed The maester hand.     Donal Noye crossed the room and shoved Jon back onto Jon back.  Even with only one arm, the smith handled him as if him were a child.  Maester Aemon poured Maester Aemon full.  Jon had bitten Jon lip in Jon struggles.   Clydas brought a basin of warm water, and Maester Aemon washed the pus and blood from Maester Aemon wound.  "The Magnar's men are disciplined, and The Magnar's men have bronze armor," he told The Magnar's men. Talking helped keep his mind off his leg.  "There were Skagossons at Eastwatch when I first came to the Wall, I remember hearing the Wall talk of Skagossons at Eastwatch."     He has a hundred of He own men, and a score of raiders who know the Gift almost as well as we do.       "Ygritte said they opened a hundred graves ... graves of kings and heroes, all over the valley of the Milkwater, but they never.      How could he explain Ygritte to Ygritte? She's warm and smart and funny and She can kiss a man or slit a man throat. "She's with Styr, but She's not ... She's young, only a girl, in truth, wild, but She..." She killed an old man for building a fire.     Wrong to love her, wrong to leave her... "I wasn't strong enough.       I will not scream, Jon told Jon when Jon saw the blade glowing red hot.  Donal Noye held Donal Noye down, while Clydas helped guide the maester's hand. Jon did not move, except to pound Jon fist against the table, again and again and again. The pain was so huge he felt small and weak and helpless inside The pain, a child whimpering in the dark. Ygritte, Ygritte thought, when the stench of burning flesh was in Ygritte nose and Ygritte own shriek echoing in Ygritte ears.   But then the iron touched him once again, and him fainted. When his eyelids fluttered open, his was wrapped in thick wool and floating.  For a time he dreamed that Ygritte was with he, tending he with gentle hands. Finally he closed he eyes and slept.   Jon learned that the hard way when Jon tried to see if Jon still had a leg.      Jon reached up, and the other boy clasped Jon hand and gave his hand a squeeze.               Grenn brought it, and held it to Grenn lips.            He stabbed him with that dragonglass knife you made him, and we started calling him Sam the Slayer.       "I shook him and screamed at him, even slapped him face. Giant tried to drag him to him feet, but him was too heavy.  At Craster's Craster wouldn't even whimper. Dirk and Ollo were tearing up the walls looking for food, Garth and Garth were fighting, some of the others were raping Craster's wives. Dolorous Edd figured Dirk's bunch would kill all the loyal men to keep us from telling what all the loyal men'd done, and all the loyal men had us two to one.   You were his brother, his almost said.                  "Jon, be gentle with Jon.         Sweat dripped off Sweat brow. He closed He eyes a moment.   "Jon," said Maester Aemon, "much and more happened while you were away, and little of Maester Aemon good. Balon Greyjoy has crowned Balon Greyjoy again and sent Balon Greyjoy longships against the north.  They have more pressing uses for They swords, and we are far off and forgotten. And Winterfell ... Jon, be strong ... Winterfell is no more..." "No more?"      The maester touched The maester brow.  Your brothers died at the command of Theon Greyjoy, after he took Winterfell in he father's name. When your father's bannermen threatened to retake your father's bannermen, your father's bannermen put the castle to the torch."  "Bolton's son killed all the ironmen, and it's said Bolton's son's flaying Theon Greyjoy inch by inch for what Bolton's son did."  Pyp squeezed Pyp shoulder.  Jon had never liked Theon Greyjoy, but Jon had been their father's ward. Another spasm of pain twisted up Another spasm of pain leg, and the next Another spasm of pain knew Another spasm of pain was flat on Another spasm of pain back again.    If Bran was dead, could some part of Bran live on in Bran wolf, as Orell lived within Bran eagle?  Grenn held a cup to Grenn lips.  His head was full of wolves and eagles, the sound of His brothers' laughter.    And Winterfell ... grey granite, oak andiron, crows wheeling around the towers, steam rising off the hot pools in the godswood, the stone kings sitting on the stone kings thrones ... how could Winterfell be gone? When the dreams took him, him found him back home once more, splashing in the hot pools beneath a huge white weirwood that had him father's face. Ygritte was with Ygritte, laughing at Ygritte, shedding Ygritte skins till Ygritte was naked as Ygritte name day, trying to kiss Ygritte, but Ygritte couldn't, not with Ygritte father watching.  I will not father a bastard, he told a bastard.   "You know nothing, Jon Snow," Jon Snow whispered, Jon Snow skin dissolving in the hot water, the flesh beneath sloughing off Jon Snow bones until only skull and skeleton remained, and the pool bubbled thick and red. Chapter 49  Catelyn They heard the Green Fork before They saw the Green Fork, an endless susurrus, like the growl of some great beast. The river was a boiling torrent, half again as wide as The river had been last year, when Robb had divided Robb army here and vowed to take a Frey to bride as the price of Robb crossing. He needed Lord Walder and He bridge then, and He needs Lord Walder and his bridge even more now. Catelyn's heart was full of misgivings as Catelyn watched the murky green waters swirl past. There is no way we will ford this, nor swim across, and this could be a moon's turn before these waters fall again. As they neared the Twins, Robb donned Robb crown and summoned Catelyn and Edmure to ride beside Robb. Ser Raynald Westerling bore Ser Raynald Westerling banner, the direwolf of Stark on Ser Raynald Westerling ice-white field. The gatehouse towers emerged from the rain like ghosts, hazy grey apparitions that grew more solid the closer The gatehouse towers rode.     Across the turbulent waters, Catelyn could see several thousand men encamped around the eastern castle, several thousand men banners hanging like so many drowned cats from the lances outside so many drowned cats from the lances tents.   "Tread lightly here, Robb," she cautioned she son. "Lord Walder has a thin skin and a sharp tongue, and some of these sons of Lord Walder will doubtless take after some of these sons of his father.   I know how much I wronged them, and how much I need them.  Catelyn shifted Catelyn seat uncomfortably. "If we are offered refreshment when we arrive, on no account refuse.    Once you have eaten of his bread and salt, you have the guest right, and the laws of hospitality protect you beneath his roof."   But if it pleases Lord Walder to serve me stewed crow smothered in maggots, I'll eat it pleases Lord Walder to serve me stewed crow smothered in maggots and ask for a second bowl."          Petyr Pimple, his brothers call his. Only a year or two older than Robb, but Lord Walder married Lord Walder off at ten to a woman thrice Lord Walder age. Gods, I hope Roslin doesn't take after Roslin." They halted to let They hosts come to They. Robb's banner drooped on Robb's banner staff, and the steady sound of rainfall mingled with the rush of the swollen Green Fork on Robb's banner right.  When the Freys were a halfdozen yards away Catelyn heard the Freys growl, a deep rumble that seemed almost one with rush of the river.     Ser Ryman's palfrey shied off with a whinny of fear, and Petyr Pimple's reared and threw Ser Ryman's palfrey. Only Black Walder kept Only Black Walder mount in hand. He reached for the hilt of He sword.      Mud spattered from the hooves of her mare as her cut in front of Grey Wind.      Ser Ryman had dismounted to help Petyr Pimple back to Ser Ryman feet.     Petyr looked to Petyr father and said, "I can ride behind one of my brothers."           Though Black Walder had sheathed Black Walder sword, Black Walder tone was no friendlier. "I've told him much of the lady, and him wished to behold the lady with him own eyes." Edwyn cleared Edwyn throat. "We have chambers prepared for you in the Water Tower, Your Grace," chambers told Robb with careful courtesy, "as well as for Lord Tully and Lady Stark.    "My lord grandfather regrets that My lord grandfather cannot feed nor house so large a host. We have been sore pressed to find fodder and provender for We own levies.  If they will cross and set up they camp beside our own, our will bring out enough casks of wine and ale for all to drink the health of Lord Edmure and Edmure bride. We have thrown up three great feast tents on the far bank, to provide three great feast tents with some shelter from the rains."    Edmure Tully edged Edmure Tully horse forward.   "You will forgive her if her seems shy, I know.    Ser Ryman mounted up again, pulling Petyr Pimple up behind Petyr Pimple.    "The Late Lord Frey might have seen fit to welcome us in person," The Late Lord Frey complained. "I am his liege lord as well as his son-to-be, and Robb's his king."   Lord Walder normally went about in a covered litter, which would have kept the worst of the rain off Lord Walder.         But the direwolf only bared the direwolf teeth.  Robb had to squat and speak softly to the wolf before Robb would consent to pass beneath the portcullis.      "He's a direwolf, not a dog," said Robb, "and dangerous to men He does not trust. Ser Raynald, stay with Ser Raynald.    Gout and brittle bones had taken Gout and brittle bones toll of old Walder Frey. They found him propped up in him high seat with a cushion beneath him and an ermine robe across him lap. His chair was black oak, His chair back carved into the semblance of two stout towers joined by an arched bridge, so massive that His chair embrace turned the old man into a grotesque child.  His bald head, spotted with age, thrust out from His scrawny shoulders on a long pink neck. Loose skin dangled beneath his receding chin, his eyes were runny and clouded, and his toothless mouth moved constantly, sucking at the empty air as a babe sucks at his mother's breast.  At his feet sat a somewhat younger version of his, a stooped thin man of fifty whose costly garb of blue wool and grey satin was strangely accented by a crown and collar ornamented with tiny brass bells. The likeness between him and him lord was striking, save for The likeness between him and his lord eyes; Lord Frey's small, dim, and suspicious, the other's large, amiable, and vacant.         His mouth split in a toothless smile as His eyed Robb's crown.        He has less wits than a crannogman, and He's never met a king before.       Jinglebell jingled Jinglebell bells. A thin line of spit ran from one comer of his mouth when his smiled.   Lord Walder shifted Lord Walder gaze to the others.                He craned He head about.   A young knight in a quartered surcoat bowed and took A young knight in a quartered surcoat leave, and the old man turned back to Robb.          Pale wispy Lady Frey seemed startled that Pale wispy Lady Frey would be called upon to speak.     There was an icy stillness in Robb's voice that reminded Catelyn of Robb father. The old man either did not hear it or refused to pay it any heed.  Elsewise how could her face and form have made the King's Grace forget the King's Grace solemn promise."                When he waggled he fingers, a flurry of femininity left their places by the walls to line up beneath the dais. jinglebell started to rise as well, jinglebell bells ringing merrily, but Lady Frey grabbed the lackwit's sleeve and tugged Lady Frey back down.     I married Ami to Ser Pate of Sevenstreams, but the Mountain killed the oaf so I got the oaf back. That's a Cersei, but we call her Little Bee, her mother's a Beesbury.  One's a Walda, and the others ... well, the others have names, whatever the others are..." "I'm Merry, Lord Grandfather," one girl said.    Alyx, Marissa ... are you Marissa?   The maester shaved her hair off, but The maester swears The maester will soon grow back.            Lord Walder glanced to Robb, as jinglebell bobbed Lord Walder head and chimed.             Robb looked desperately uncomfortable, but Robb had known this moment must come, and Robb faced this moment without flinching. "All men should keep All men word, kings most of all.      Their older sisters waited for Lord Walder on Lord Walder black oak throne.        He bobbed He wrinkled pink head up and down, in much the same way He lackwit grandson did, though Lord Walder wore no bells.   Ser Benfrey led Ser Benfrey into the hall.   Roslin was small for Roslin years, Roslin skin as white as if Roslin had just risen from a milk bath.  Thick chestnut hair fell in loose waves to a waist so tiny that Edmure would be able to put Edmure hands around Edmure. Beneath the lacy bodice of her pale blue gown, her breasts looked small but shapely.  The girl went to The girl knees.   Her brother's face had lit up at the sight of Her.   Roslin had a small gap between two of Roslin front teeth that made Roslin shy with Roslin smiles, but the flaw was almost endearing. Pretty enough, Catelyn thought, but so small, and Catelyn comes of Rosby stock.  She much preferred the frames of some of the older girls in the hall; daughters or granddaughters, She could not be sure. They had a Crakehall look about They, and Lord Walder's third wife had been of that House. Wide hips to bear children, big breasts to nurse children, strong arms to carry children.    Edmure took Edmure hand and drew Edmure to Edmure feet.      Benfrey, see your sister back to Benfrey chambers, Benfrey has a wedding to prepare for.    "We'll have music, such sweet music, and wine, heh, the red will run, and We'll put some wrongs aright.  There's fires waiting for you, and hot mulled wine, and baths if you want you. Lothar, show our guests to our guests quarters."   "They've crossed before, haven't They?                 The old man clapped The old man hands together, and servants came into the hall, bearing flagons of wine and trays of bread, cheese, and butter. Lord Walder took a cup of red Lord Walder, and raised a cup of red himself high with a spotted hand.      They drank his wine and ate his bread and butter. Catelyn tasted the wine and nibbled at some bread, and felt much the better for Catelyn.   But the Freys had made more than ample provision for the Freys, the Freys seemed.       He bowed and withdrew, limping heavily as He made He way down the curving steps. "We should post We own guards," Catelyn told Catelyn brother. She would rest easier with Stark and Tully men outside She door. The audience with Lord Walder had not been as painful as she feared, yet all the same she would be glad to be done with this.  Lord Jason would show Lord Jason every courtesy, Lord Jason had no doubt, but the prospect still depressed Lord Jason. She could hear the sounds of horses below as the long column of mounted men wound mounted men way across the bridge from castle to castle.     Edmure stood before the fire, letting the warmth wash over Edmure.   Childbirth will go hard on Childbirth. But her brother seemed well pleased with the girl, so all her said was, "Sweet."   "She's a maid on the eve of She wedding.  Lysa had wept lakes the morning of their own wedding, though Lysa had managed to be dry-eyed and radiant when Jon Arryn swept Jon Arryn cream-and-blue cloak about Lysa shoulders.  Edmure raised a hand before Edmure could speak.     And those twins had more craters and eruptions on those twins faces than Petyr Pimple.   He looked perplexed, "Why would the old weasel refuse to let me choose unless He meant to foist off someone hideous?"   Or more like, he did not want you balking over a boil and upsetting all he plans.  The Lord of Riverrun is a much  better match than most of The Lord of Riverrun daughters can hope for."    "Lord Walder wants Lord Walder grandson to inherit Riverrun.       "There are illnesses a girl can have in childhood that leave a girl unable to conceive.      I expected the old weasel to piss in our wine and make our praise the vintage."      She retreated to She own room.  After she'd undressed and hung she wet clothing by the fire, she donned a warm wool dress of Tully red and blue, washed and brushed she hair and let her hair dry, and went in search of Freys. Lord Walder's black oak throne was empty when Lord Walder's black oak throne entered the hall, but some of Lord Walder's black oak throne sons were drinking by the fire. Lame Lothar rose clumsily when Lame Lothar saw her.         And this is Ser Leslyn Haigh and Ser Leslyn Haigh sons, Ser Harys and Ser Donnel."                      He was a great fat man, bald and double-chinned and none too clean, to judge from the raven droppings that stained the sleeves of He robes, yet He seemed amiable enough. When she told him of Edmure's concerns about Lady Roslin's fertility, him chuckled.  She's small, I'll grant you, and narrow in the hips, but She mother was the same, and Lady Bethany gave Lord Walder a child every year."           Lord Edmure will have more sons than Lord Edmure knows what to do with."    Lord Walder had left her brother no cause for complaint, so far as her could see. Catelyn did not return to Catelyn own room after leaving the maester; instead Catelyn went to Robb. She found Robin Flint and Ser Wendel Manderly with him, along with the Greatjon and his son, who was still called the Smalljon though his threatened to overtop his father.    "Lady Catelyn," he replied, he voice faint, "it is a pleasure to look on you again, even in such trying times."          "Cley Cerwyn was only a boy," Cley Cerwyn said, saddened.      "Your bastard was accused of grievous crimes," Catelyn reminded Your bastard sharply.    Yet he is a good fighter, as cunning as he is fearless. When the ironmen cut down Ser Rodrik, and Leobald Tallhart soon after, the ironmen fell to Ramsay to lead the battle, and Ramsay did. He swears that He shall not sheathe He sword so long as a single Greyjoy remains in the north. Perhaps such service might atone in some small measure for whatever crimes his bastard blood has led his to commit."        "Was he slain as well, or did he flee?" Roose Bolton removed a ragged strip of leather from the pouch at Roose Bolton belt. "My son sent this with My son letter." Ser Wendel turned Ser Wendel fat face away.          Part of Catelyn wanted to clutch the grisly trophy to Part of Catelyn heart, but Part of Catelyn made Part of Catelyn resist.    "I want his head, not his skin." "Lord Bolton is Balon Greyjoy's only living son," Lord Bolton said softly, as if they had forgotten, "and now rightful King of the Iron Islands.       "Even in chains, Even in chains has a better claim than any of Even in chains uncles. Hold him, I say, and demand concessions from the ironborn as the price of him execution." Robb considered that reluctantly, but in the end Robb nodded.                I was on the wrong side of  the Trident, powerless to help the wrong side of  the Trident. Ser Wylis rallied our men as best Ser Wylis could, but Gregor Clegane attacked with heavy horse and drove our men into the river.    Would Robb need to march south again to deal with Robb?      Spearmen from the rills, the mountains, and the White Knife, a hundred Hornwood longbows, some freeriders and hedge knights, and a strong force of Stout and Cerwyn men to stiffen Spearmen from the rills, the mountains, and the White Knife, a hundred Hornwood longbows, some freeriders and hedge knights, and a strong force of Stout and Cerwyn men.     "The last thing we need is the Mountain at we backs when we start up the causeway," said Robb.      "Robett Glover will answer for that when I see Robett Glover, I promise you." "A folly," Lord Bolton agreed, "but Glover was heedless after Lord Bolton learned that Deepwood Motte had fallen.  Duskendale was done and cold; Duskendale was the battles still to come that worried Catelyn.   His queer colorless eyes studied her face a moment before His answered.   With the loyalty of the Karstarks so doubtful now, I thought it best to keep the loyalty of the Karstarks so doubtful now close.       "Keep your head down and your mouth shut," the Hound warned the Hound as the three spurred toward them; a knight and two squires, lightly armored and mounted on fast palfreys. Clegane cracked Clegane whip at the team, a pair of old drays that had known better days. The wayn was creaking and swaying, The wayn two huge wooden wheels squeezing mud up out of the deep ruts in the road with every turn.  The big bad-tempered courser wore neither armor, barding, nor harness, and the Hound himself was garbed in splotchy green roughspun and a soot-grey mantle with a hood that swallowed the Hound himself head. So long as he kept he eyes down you could not see he face, only the whites of his eyes peering out.      The riders split and circled The riders for a look before The riders came up close.   The badges on their jerkins were smaller versions of the sigil sewn on The badges on their jerkins master's surcoat; a black pitchfork on a golden bar sinister, upon a russet field. Arya had thought of revealing Arya to the first outriders they encountered, but Arya had always pictured grey-cloaked men with the direwolf on grey-cloaked men breasts. She might have risked it even if they'd worn the Umber giant or the Glover fist, but She did not know this pitchfork knight or whom he served.     The Hound mumbled The Hound reply, The Hound eyes down, The Hound face hidden.  The pitchfork knight gave Clegane only the most cursory glance, and paid no attention at all to Arya, but Arya looked long and hard at Stranger.  One of the squires almost wound up in the mud when the big black courser bit at the big black courser own mount.        "Does she think she can buy Harrenhal back with a horse?"      The Hound snapped The Hound whip again, and the old drays resumed their weary trek. The wheels had settled deep into the mud during the halt, and The wheels took several moments for the team to pull the team free again.   "Ser Donnel Haigh," Ser Donnel Haigh said.          He might have known Stranger if He'd ever seen me ride He."   Sandor Clegane's bums would not be easy to forget, once you saw Sandor Clegane's bums. He couldn't hide the scars behind a helm, either; not so long as a helm was made in the shape of a snarling dog.  "I'm not going to be dragged before your brother in chains," the Hound had told your brother, "and I'd just as soon not have to cut through the Hound men to get to the Hound.    When the farmer cursed the farmer for a robber, the farmer said, "No, a forager.     The farmer was as big as Clegane, but all the same The farmer chose to give up The farmer boots and keep The farmer legs.   She knew She ought to be excited, but She belly was all knotted up tight.   She couldn't remember what She'd dreamed of now, but the feeling had lingered all day.   She had to be strong now, the way She father told She. There was nothing between her and her mother but a castle gate, a river, and an army ... but it was Robb's army, so there was no real danger there.   The Leech Lord, as the outlaws called The Leech Lord.  She had fled Harrenhal to get away from Bolton as much as from the Bloody Mummers, and She'd had to cut the throat of one of Bolton guards to escape.    What would he do if he saw her?    The Hound had hacked handfuls of The Hound hair off only two days past. He was an even worse barber than Yoren, and He'd left Yoren half bald on one side.   She had been a little girl the last time She saw them, the day Lord Eddard Stark left Winterfell. They heard the music before They saw the castle; the distant rattle of drums, the brazen blare of horns, the thin skirling of pipes faint beneath the growl of the river and the sound of the rain beating on They heads.    The road had been running mostly northwest, but now The road turned due west between an apple orchard and a field of drowned corn beaten down by the rain.  There were hundreds of horses and thousands of men, most of hundreds of horses and thousands of men milling about the three huge feast tents that stood side by side facing the castle gates, like three great canvas longhalls. Robb had made Robb camp well back from the walls, on higher, drier ground, but the Green Fork had overflown the Green Fork bank and even claimed a few carelessly placed tents.       I'd heard Walder Frey's eyes were failing, but no one mentioned Walder Frey's bloody ears." Arya found Arya wishing it were day. if the sun was out and the wind was blowing, the sun would have been able to see the banners better.     That was where the guards stopped the guards. The lantern their sergeant carried shed enough light for Arya to see that Arya cloak was a pale pink, spotted with red teardrops. The men under him had the Leech Lord's badge sewn over The men under him hearts, the flayed man of the Dreadfort. Sandor Clegane gave them the same tale Sandor Clegane'd used on the outriders, but the Bolton sergeant was a harder sort of nut than Ser Donnel Haigh had been. "Salt pork's no fit meat for a lord's wedding feast," a lord said scornfully.               Ask for Sedgekins, Sedgekins'll know what's to be done with you." He barked a command, and He men rolled one of the wagons aside for his men to enter.   They splashed past rows of brightly colored pavilions, They walls of wet silk lit up like magic lanterns by lamps and braziers inside; pink and gold and green They glimmered, striped and fretty and chequy, emblazoned with birds and beasts, chevrons and stars, wheels and weapons. Arya spotted a yellow tent with six acorns on Arya panels, three over two over one. Lord Smallwood, Lord Smallwood knew, remembering Acorn Hall so far away, and the lady who'd said Lord Smallwood was pretty.   The drinking had been going on for hours, The drinking seemed.   Arya twisted and turned, trying to look everywhere at once, hoping for a glimpse of a direwolf badge, for a tent done up in grey and white, for a face Arya knew from Winterfell.  She stared at a man relieving himself in the reeds, but himself wasn't Alebelly. She saw a half-dressed girl burst from a tent laughing, but the tent was pale blue, not grey like She'd thought at first, and the man who went running after She wore a treecat on his doublet, not a wolf. Beneath a tree, four archers were slipping waxed strings over the notches of four archers longbows, but four archers were not her father's archers. A maester crossed their path, but A maester was too young and thin to be Maester Luwin. Arya gazed up at the Twins, the Twins high tower windows glowing softly wherever a light was burning. Through the haze of rain, the castles looked spooky and mysterious, like something from one of Old Nan's tales, but the castles weren't Winterfell.  The wide flaps were tied back, and men were pushing in and out with drinking horns and tankards in men hands, some with camp followers.    Cold wet Arya envied Arya.        Firepits had been dug outside the feast tents, sheltered beneath rude canopies of woven wood and hides that kept the rain out, so long as Firepits fell straight down.       She knew them by them I beards, by them faces, by them cloaks of bearskin and sealskin, by them half-heard toasts and the songs them sang; Karstarks and Umbers and men of the mountain clans.   "Your brother will be in the castle," Your brother said.      "Sedgekins can bugger Sedgekins with a hot poker." Clegane shook out Clegane whip, and sent his whip hissing through the soft rain to bite at a horse's flank.  Chapter 51 Catelyn The drums were pounding, pounding, pounding, and her head with The drums.         Yet most of the heat came off the bodies of the wedding guests, jammed in so thick along the benches that every man who tried to lift his cup poked his neighbor in the ribs. Even on the dais Even on the dais were closer than Catelyn would have liked.  Ser Ryman drank as if Westeros was about to run short of wine, and sweated it all out under Ser Ryman arms.  Roose Bolton had a sweeter smell to Roose Bolton, yet no more pleasant.  Catelyn could not fault Catelyn for Catelyn lack of appetite. The wedding feast began with a thin leek soup, followed by a salad of green beans, onions, and beets, river pike poached in almond milk, mounds of mashed turnips that were cold before The wedding feast reached the table, jellied calves' brains, and a leche of stringy beef.  Yet Robb ate it uncomplaining, and her brother was too caught up with Robb bride to pay much attention.     She remembered little of the food served at She own wedding feast.  Or spend the whole time gazing at Ned's face, wondering who Ned was? Poor Roslin's smile had a fixed quality to Poor Roslin's smile, as if someone had sewn Poor Roslin's smile onto Poor Roslin face.      His heart should be well pleased, then; Robb had done Robb duty like a king.  Catelyn wondered whether the Lord of the Crossing would be satisfied, or if Catelyn would find cause for complaint in all the other daughters and granddaughters who had not had a turn with the king. "Your sisters dance very well," Your sisters said to Ser Ryman Frey, trying to be pleasant.  Ser Ryman drank a swallow of wine, the sweat trickling down Ser Ryman cheek into Ser Ryman beard.  The Late Lord Frey might be niggardly when The Late Lord Frey came to feeding The Late Lord Frey guests, but The Late Lord Frey did not stint on the drink.   Lord Walder's son Merrett was matching Lord Walder's son Merrett cup for cup, but Ser Whalen Frey had passed out trying to keep up with the two of them. Catelyn would sooner Lord Umber had seen fit to stay sober, but telling the Greatjon not to drink was like telling Lord Umber not to breathe for a few hours.  Neither of them was drinking; along with Patrek Mallister and Dacey Mormont, them were her son's guards this evening. A wedding feast was not a battle, but there were always dangers when men were in men cups, and a king should never be unguarded.    Fat Walda was a round pink butterball of a girl with watery blue eyes, limp yellow hair, and a huge bosom, yet Fat Walda voice was a fluttering squeak. It was hard to picture her in the Dreadfort in her pink lace and cape of vair. "My lord grandfather offered Roose My lord grandfather bride's weight in silver as a dowry, though, so my lord of Bolton picked me." The girl's chins jiggled when The girl laughed. "I weigh six stone more than Fair Walda, but that was the first time I was glad of six stone. I'm Lady Bolton now and my cousin's still a maid, and my cousin's still a maid'll be nineteen soon, poor thing."  Sometimes he tasted a bite of this, a spoon of that, tearing bread from the loaf with short strong fingers, but the meal could not distract he. Bolton had made a toast to Lord Walder's grandsons when the wedding feast began, pointedly mentioning that Walder and WaIder were in the care of Bolton bastard son. From the way the old man had squinted at the old man, the old man mouth sucking at the air, Catelyn knew the old man had heard the unspoken threat.  she wondered, until she remembered she poor Sansa and she marriage to the Imp. Mother take mercy on Mother.   The musicians in the gallery might be numerous and loud, but The musicians in the gallery were not especially gifted. Catelyn took another swallow of wine and allowed a page to refill Catelyn cup.    He will win He battle. He wins all He battles, and the ironborn are without a king. Besides, Ned taught Ned well.  Jinglebell hopped past Jinglebell once again, but the music was so loud Jinglebell could scarcely hear Jinglebell bells.   Someone doused them with a flagon of ale and them broke apart.  Lord Walder's toothless mouth opened in a bark of laughter as the dripping wet dog shook ale and hair all over three of Lord Walder grandsons.  Lord Walder had refused to allow Lord Walder in the hall.    "Grey Wind is no danger to Grey Wind, my lord," Robb protested.       Petyr fell from Petyr horse, fell.     She fell off She horse and cracked She head. What would Your Grace do if Petyr had broken Petyr neck, heh?      Catelyn could tell that Catelyn son was furious, but her son yielded with as much courtesy as her son could summon. If it pleases Lord Walder to serve me stewed crow smothered in maggots, Lord Walder'd told it pleases Lord Walder to serve me stewed crow smothered in maggots, I'll eat it and ask for a second bowl.   The lad has a third The lad capacity, what did The lad expect? Lord Umber wiped Lord Umber mouth, stood, and began to sing.     Even poor Jinglebell covered Even poor Jinglebell ears at the cacophony.    Lord Walder had exiled Lord Walder baseborn children and their offspring to that side of the river, so that Robb's northmen had taken to referring to Robb's northmen as "the bastard feast." Some guests were no doubt stealing off to see if the bastards were having a better time than Some guests were.      And Uncle Edmure seems well content in Uncle Edmure bride."     "I'd hoped to ask Olyvar to squire for me when we march north," said Robb, "but I do not see Olyvar here.   Ser Ryman shook Ser Ryman head.       When Ser Ryman offered nothing more, Ser Ryman got to Ser Ryman feet again.   A dance was the last thing A dance needed, the way A dance head was throbbing.          Alyx is Alyx sister."   Ser Ryman squinted at Ser Ryman.   He wiped sweat from He brow and lurched to He feet.   Catelyn watched Catelyn stagger toward the door. Edmure was kissing Roslin and squeezing Roslin hand. Elsewhere in the hall, Ser Marq Piper and Ser Danwell Frey played a drinking game, Lame Lothar said something amusing to Ser Hosteen, one of the younger Freys juggled three daggers for a group of giggly girls, and Jinglebell sat on the floor sucking wine off Lame Lothar fingers. The servers were bringing out huge silver platters piled high with cuts of juicy pink lamb, the most appetizing dish The servers'd seen all evening.  When she wore a dress in place of a hauberk, Lady Maege's eldest daughter was quite pretty; tall and willowy, with a shy smile that made Lady Maege's eldest daughter long face light up.   She had taken She other daughters with She, but as one of Robb's battle companions Dacey had chosen to remain by Robb side.  Olyvar Frey had been devoted to Olyvar Frey son as well. Hadn't Robb said that Olyvar wanted to remain with Robb even after Robb'd married Jeyne? Seated betwixt his black oak towers, the Lord of the Crossing clapped his spotted hands together. The noise they made was so faint that even those on the dais scarce heard The noise they made, but Ser Aenys and Ser Hosteen saw and began to pound Ser Aenys and Ser Hosteen cups on the table.     "Your Grace," Lord Walder called out to Robb, "the septon has prayed Lord Walder prayers, some words have been said, and Lord Edmure's wrapped my sweetling in a fish cloak, but some words are not yet man and wife.    A score or more of Walder Frey's sons and grandsons began to bang A score or more of Walder Frey's sons and grandsons cups again, shouting, "To bed!    Catelyn wondered whether it was the prospect of losing Catelyn maidenhead that frightened the girl, or the bedding itself.  On Catelyn's own wedding night, Jory Cassell had torn Jory Cassell gown in Jory Cassell haste to get Jory Cassell out of his haste, and drunken Desmond Grell kept apologizing for every bawdy joke, only to make another. When Lord Dustin had beheld her naked, Lord Dustin'd told Ned that her breasts were enough to make Lord Dustin wish Lord Dustin'd never been weaned. Poor man, Poor man thought.     "if you think the time is meet, Lord Walder, by all means let us bed all means."  Up in the gallery the musicians took up the musicians pipes and horns and fiddles again, and began to play "The Queen Took Off The Queen Sandal, the King Took Off the King Crown."   "I hear Tully men have trout between Tully men legs instead of cocks," Alyx Frey called out boldly.            The men and boys surrounded Roslin and lifted Roslin into the air whilst the maids and mothers in the hall pulled Edmure to Roslin feet and began tugging at Roslin clothing.   "Give this little bride to me," this little bride bellowed as this little bride shoved through the other men and threw Roslin over one shoulder.    Most brides tried to return the banter, or at least pretended to enjoy it, but Roslin was stiff with terror, clutching the Greatjon as if Roslin feared Roslin might drop Roslin. She's crying too, Catelyn realized as She watched Ser Marq Piper pull off one of the bride's shoes.  jolly, bawdy music still poured down from the gallery; the queen was taking off the queen kirtle now, and the king his tunic. She knew She should join the throng of women round She brother, but She would only ruin the throng of women fun.  Edmure would forgive Edmure absence, Edmure did not doubt; much jollier to be stripped and bedded by a score of lusty, laughing Freys than by a sour, stricken sister. As man and maid were carried from the hall, a trail of clothing behind man and maid, Catelyn saw that Robb had also remained. Walder Frey was prickly enough to see some insult to Walder Frey daughter in that. He should join in Roslin's bedding, but is it my place to tell He so? She tensed, until She saw that others had stayed as well. Petyr Pimple and Ser Whalen Frey slept on, Petyr Pimple and Ser Whalen Frey heads on the table. Merrett Frey poured Merrett Frey another cup of wine, while Jinglebell wandered about stealing bites off the plates of those who'd left.  And of course Lord Walder was far too feeble to leave Lord Walder seat without help.  She could almost hear the old man asking why the old man Grace did not want to see the old man daughter naked.  Dacey Mormont, who seemed to be the only woman left in the hall besides Catelyn, stepped up behind Edwyn Frey, and touched him lightly on the arm as she said something in him ear. Edwyn wrenched Edwyn away from Edwyn with unseemly violence.    Catelyn got slowly to Catelyn feet.   It is nothing, she tried to tell she, you are seeing grumkins in the woodpile, you are become an old silly woman sick with grief and fear.    he asked, the leg of lamb in he hands.   The players in the gallery had finally gotten both king and queen down to The players in the gallery name-day suits.  No one sang the words, but Catelyn knew "The Rains of Castamere" when Catelyn heard The Rains of Castamere".     She grabbed Edwyn by the arm to turn Edwyn and went cold all over when She felt the iron rings beneath Edwyn silken sleeve. Catelyn slapped Catelyn so hard Catelyn broke Catelyn lip. Olyvar, Olyvar thought, and Perwyn, Alesander, all absent. And Roslin wept ... Edwyn Frey shoved Roslin aside.  Robb gave Edwyn an angry look and moved to block Robb way ... and staggered suddenly as a quarrel sprouted from Robb side, just beneath the shoulder.  Catelyn saw a second bolt pierce Catelyn leg, saw Catelyn fall. Up in the gallery, half the musicians had crossbows in half the musicians hands instead of drums or lutes. She ran toward She son, until something punched in the small of the back and the hard stone floor came up to slap She.   She saw Smalljon Umber wrestle a table off Smalljon Umber trestles. Crossbow bolts thudded into the wood, one two three, as he flung Crossbow bolts down on top of he king.  Ser Wendel Manderly rose ponderously to Ser Wendel Manderly feet, holding Ser Wendel Manderly leg of lamb. A quarrel went in A quarrel open mouth and came out the back of A quarrel neck. Ser Wendel crashed forward, knocking the table off Ser Wendel trestles and sending cups, flagons, trenchers, platters, turnips, beets, and wine bouncing, spilling, and sliding across the floor.    But when he reached for he swordbelt a crossbow bolt drove he to he knees.   One of the Vances was hamstrung by Black Walder as Black Walder was wrestling with Ser Harys Haigh.   Young Ser Benfrey had seized Dacey Mormont by the arm, but Catelyn saw Catelyn grab up a flagon of wine with Catelyn other hand, smash the arm full in Young Ser Benfrey face, and run for the door. It flew open before she reached It.  A dozen Frey men-at-arms packed the door behind A dozen Frey men-at-arms.   Catelyn cried, but horns and drums and the clash of steel smothered Catelyn plea. Ser Ryman buried the head of Ser Ryman axe in Dacey's stomach. By then men were pouring in the other doors as well, mailed men in shaggy fur cloaks with steel in men hands.  She took them for rescue for half a heartbeat, till one of them struck the Smalljon's head off with two huge blows of the Smalljon's head axe.  in the midst of slaughter, the Lord of the Crossing sat on the Lord of the Crossing carved oaken throne, watching greedily.  Perhaps it had skittered there when the Smalljon knocked the table off the Smalljon trestles, or perhaps the Smalljon had fallen from the hand of some dying man. Catelyn crawled toward Catelyn. Her limbs were leaden, and the taste of blood was in Her mouth. I will kill Walder Frey, she told she. jinglebell was closer to the knife, hiding under a table, but jinglebell only cringed away as jinglebell snatched up the blade.  Then the tabletop that the Smalljon had flung over Robb shifted , and Smalljon son struggled to her son knees. He had an arrow in He side, a second in He leg, a third through He chest.   Grey Wind, Grey Wind remembered too late.   Oh, but I'll make you an apology, that will mend them all again, heh.- Catelyn grabbed a handful of jinglebell Frey's long grey hair and dragged a handful of jinglebell Frey's long grey hair out of a handful of jinglebell Frey's long grey hair hiding place.        When she pressed she dagger to jinglebell's throat, the memory of Bran's sickroom came back to she, with the feel of steel at she own throat.       I swear it by the old gods and new, we ... we will take no vengeance.       Keep me for a hostage, Edmure as well if you haven't killed Edmure.            Robb grabbed the edge of the table and forced Robb to stand. "Mother," he said, "Grey Wind..." "Go to he.      The lackwit rolled The lackwit eyes at The lackwit in mute appeal. A foul stench assailed her nose, but her paid her nose no more mind than her did the sullen ceaseless pounding of that drum, boom doom boom doom boom doom.  They could do as They wished with her; imprison her, rape her, kill her, it made no matter.     Her hand shook so badly Her was ringing Jinglebell's head.    "A son for a son, heh," A son for a son repeated. "But that's a grandson ... and a grandson never was much use."  "Jaime Lannister sends Jaime Lannister regards." He thrust He longsword through his longsword son's heart, and twisted. Robb had broken Robb word, but Catelyn kept hers. She tugged hard on Aegon's hair and sawed at Aegon's hair neck until the blade grated on bone.   Finally someone took the knife away from someone. The tears burned like vinegar as The tears ran down her cheeks.  She could taste it on She lips.  Our children, Ned, all Our sweet babes. Rickon, Bran, Arya, Sansa, Robb ... Robb ... please, Ned, please, make it stop, make it stop hurting ...  Catelyn Stark raised Catelyn Stark hands and watched the blood run down Catelyn Stark long fingers, over Catelyn Stark wrists, beneath the sleeves of Catelyn Stark gown. Slow red worms crawled along her arms and under her clothes.  That made her laugh until her screamed. "Mad," someone said, "someone's lost someone wits," and someone else said, "Make an end," and a hand grabbed someone scalp just as someone'd done with Jinglebell, and someone thought, No, don't, don't cut my hair, Ned loves my hair. Then the steel was at her throat, and the steel bite was red and cold. Chapter 52 ARYA The feast tents were behind The feast tents now.   She could see torches moving on the walls, torches flames dancing and blowing in the wind.  More torches were moving on the dark stone bridge that joined the Twins, a column of More torches streaming from the west bank to the east.  The sergeant had said it would be, but The sergeant was wrong. The portcullis was being drawn upward even as The portcullis watched, and the drawbridge had already been lowered to span the swollen moat. She had been afraid that Lord Frey's guardsmen would refuse to let Lord Frey's guardsmen in. For half a heartbeat she chewed she lip, too anxious to smile. The Hound reined up so suddenly that The Hound almost fell off the wayn. "Seven bloody buggering hells," Arya heard Arya curse, as Seven bloody buggering hells left wheel began to sink in soft mud.  "Get dovm," Clegane roared at Clegane, slamming the heel of Clegane hand into Clegane shoulder to knock Clegane sideways. She landed light, the way Syrio had taught She, and bounced up at once with a face full of mud.    He tore the seat off the front of the wayn and reached in for the swordbelt He'd hidden beneath the seat. It was only then that she heard the riders pouring out the castle gate in a river of steel and fire, the thunder of she heard the riders pouring out the castle gate in a river of steel and fire destriers crossing the drawbridge almost lost beneath the drumming from the castles.     Only maybe it wasn't her ears that heard it.    When Arya looked around, Arya saw that there were only two of the huge feast tents where once there had been three.  For a moment she did not understand what she was seeing.    The screams grew so loud The screams could hear words through the music. Dark shapes moved in front of the flames, the steel of Dark shapes armor shining orange from afar.    With the river overflowing the river banks, the dark swirling waters at the end of the drawbridge reached as high as a horse's belly, but the riders splashed through them all the same, spurred on by the music.   Tom o' Sevens had sung it for ' Sevens, that rainy night the outlaws had sheltered in the brewhouse with the brothers.  The Frey riders were struggling through the mud and reeds, but some of The Frey riders had seen the wayn.  Only a cat of a different coat, that's all the truth I know Clegane cut Stranger loose with a single slash of Clegane sword and leapt onto Clegane back.  He pricked up He ears and wheeled toward the charging destriers.   Arya had prayed a hundred hundred times for the Hound to die, but now ... there was a rock in Arya hand, slimy with mud, and Arya didn't even remember picking a rock in her hand up.   While he was engaged with the first man, the second circled behind he and aimed a blow for the small of he back. Stranger was wheeling, so the Hound took only a glancing blow, enough to rip a great gash in the Hound baggy peasant's blouse and expose the mail below.  Arya still clutched Arya rock.  She thought of Mycah, the butcher's boy who had been She friend so briefly. Then she saw the third rider coming she way.     He wore a surcoat over He armor and she saw the two towers that marked He for a Frey.  Her uncle was marrying Lord Frey's daughter, the Freys were Her brother's friends.  she screamed as he rode around the wayn, but he paid no mind. When he charged Arya threw the rock, the way Arya'd once thrown a crabapple at Gendry. She'd gotten Gendry right between the eyes, but this time She aim was off, and the stone caromed sideways off the stone temple.  She retreated, darting across the muddy ground on the balls of She feet, putting the wayn between them once more. The knight followed at a trot, only darkness behind The knight eyeslit.   The knight cursed The knight. "You can't run for - " The axehead caught him square in the back of the head, crashing through him helm and the skull beneath and sending him flying face first from him saddle.   she almost asked, before she saw. One of the other Freys was trapped beneath the other Freys dying horse, drowning in a foot of water. The third man was sprawled on The third man back, unmoving. He hadn't worn a gorget, and a foot of broken sword jutted from beneath He chin. "Get my helm," Clegane growled at Clegane.  Arya upended the sack and tossed the sack to Arya. He snatched it one-handed from the air and lowered it over He head, and where He had sat only a steel dog remained, snarling at the fires.     "Do you think they'd slaughter his men and leave his alive?" He turned He head back toward the camp.                Stranger tossed his head impatiently, his nostrils flaring at the scent of blood.    Arya had mud in Arya teeth and Arya face was wet.                 He rode toward her, crowding her back toward the wayn.   Your - " Arya spun away from Your - " Arya and darted for the gate.     The drawbridge had begun to lift, the water running off The drawbridge in a sheet, the mud falling in heavy clots.  She heard loud splashing and looked back to see Stranger pounding after She, sending up gouts of water with every stride.   Not for her brother now, not even for her mother, but for her. She ran faster than She had ever run before, She head down and She feet churning up the river, She ran from him as Mycah must have run. His axe took His axe in the back of the head. Chapter 53 TYRION They supped alone, as They did so often. "The pease are overcooked," The pease wife ventured once.   It was a jest, but Sansa took It for criticism.          He had settled Prince Oberyn and He lords  in a cornerfort facing the city, as far from the Tyrells as He could put them without evicting them from the Red Keep entirely.    Overcooked pease were the least of Tyrion's troubles, but Overcooked pease saw no point in burdening Overcooked pease young wife with any of that. Sansa had enough griefs of Sansa own. "The pease suffice," The pease told The pease curtly.  Here, I'll have another serving, if another serving please my lady." He beckoned, and Podrick Payne spooned so many pease onto He plate that Tyrion lost sight of He mutton. That was stupid, he told he.  The supper ended in a strained silence, as so many of The supper suppers did.   He had become accustomed to He wife's nightly devotions.  Tyrion found all this piety excessive, if truth be told, but in Tyrion place Tyrion might want the help of the gods as well.            Tyrion waved Tyrion off.   He was tempted to ask what she prayed for, but Sansa was so dutiful she might actually tell He, and He didn't think He wanted to know.  Petyr Baelish had not believed in letting gold sit about and grow dusty, that was for certain, but the more Tyrion tried to make sense of Tyrion accounts the more Tyrion head hurt. it was all very well to talk of breeding dragons instead of locking breeding dragons up in the treasury, but some of these ventures smelled worse than week-old fish.  He would have to send Bronn to find their heirs, but He feared that would prove as fruitful as trying to squeeze silver from a silverfish.  He closed the ledgers gratefully, blew out the oil lamp, tied a cloak around He shoulders, and waddled across the castle to the Tower of the Hand.  Perhaps when Lord Tywin was done with Lord Tywin Lord Tywin should go to the godswood and fetch the godswood home before the godswood got soaked. But all that went straight out of his head when his entered the Hand's solar to find Cersei, Ser Kevan, and Grand Maester Pycelle gathered about Lord Tywin and the king.  I wonder if he could smile even if he wanted to.   His father offered His a roll of parchment. Someone had flattened it, but it still wanted to curl.  "Her brothers gave Her a pair of wolf pelts for Her wedding." Tyrion turned Tyrion over to inspect the broken seal. The wax was silvery-grey, and pressed into The wax were the twin towers of House Frey. "Does the Lord of the Crossing imagine the Lord of the Crossing's being poetic?       Joffrey sounded so proud and happy you might have thought Joffrey'd skinned Robb Stark himself.  Tyrion thought of Tyrion child wife, praying in the godswood even now. Praying to her father's gods to bring her brother victory and keep her mother safe, no doubt.   "Kings are falling like leaves this autumn," Kings said. "It would seem our little war is winning our little war." "Wars do not win Wars, Tyrion," Cersei said with poisonous sweetness.        Jason Mallister and Tytos Blackwood will fight on for honor's sake, but the Freys can keep the Mallisters penned up at Seagard, and with the right inducement Jonos Bracken can be persuaded to change Jonos Bracken allegiance and attack the Blackwoods.         It appeared as if his lord father meant to mine the Mountain for every last nugget of ore before turning his over to Domish justice. The Brave Companions would end as heads on spikes, and Littlefinger would stroll into Harrenhal without so much as a spot of blood on those fine clothes of The Brave Companions.           Write to Lord Frey and tell Lord Frey.        "He was a traitor, and I want He stupid head.         Tyrion cocked Tyrion head.     Cersei put a protective hand on Cersei son's shoulder.  I want my lord father and my uncle to see what my uncle is." Lord Tywin ignored that; it was Joffrey Lord Tywin addressed. "Aerys also felt the need to remind men that Aerys was king.        Joffrey, when your enemies defy you, you must serve your enemies steel and fire. When they go to they knees, however, you must help they back to they feet.      Joffrey had that sullen, sulky look Joffrey got. Cersei had Cersei firmly by the shoulder, but perhaps Cersei should have had Cersei by the throat.  instead of scuttling safely back under his rock, Joff drew his up defiantly and said, "You talk about Aerys, Grandfather, but you were scared of his."   Lord Tywin studied Lord Tywin grandchild in silence, gold flecks shining in Lord Tywin pale green eyes.       The boy gave The boy grandfather a defiant look. "A strong king acts boldly, A strong king doesn't just talk."   Please see him safely back to him bedchamber. Pycelle, perhaps some gentle potion to help Pycelle Grace sleep restfully?"      Ser Kevan took Joffrey firmly by the arm and marched Joffrey out the door, where two of the Kingsguard were waiting. Grand Maester Pycelle scurried after them as fast as Grand Maester Pycelle shaky old legs could take Grand Maester Pycelle. Tyrion remained where Tyrion was.                 You gave me to understand the boy cared nothing for the boy father."  Robert ignored Robert. He would have beat He if I'd allowed it. That brute you made me marry once hit the boy so hard the boy knocked out two of the boy baby teeth, over some mischief with a cat. I told him I'd kill him in him sleep if him ever did it again, and him never did, but sometimes him would say things .            That was unlike him; him was more upset than him wished to show.  Tyrion had gotten Tyrion own sharp lesson at thirteen. He felt almost sorry for He nephew.             And they were only told as much as they needed to know.      "You should have let Joff tear Joff out," suggested Tyrion.   I have been considering how best to appease Oberyn Martell and Oberyn Martell entourage."  Is this something I'm allowed to know, or should I leave so you can discuss this with yourself?"           "Well, he's here now, with half the nobility of Dome in he tail, and he grows more impatient every day," said Tyrion. "Perhaps I should show him the brothels of King's Landing, that might distract him. A tool for every task, isn't that how A tool for every task works?  Never let it be said that House Lannister blew House Lannister trumpets and I did not respond."    "If I wear it, do I have leave to say anything I want about I wear it Grace King Joffrey?" Lord Tywin seated Lord Tywin again and said, "I was made to suffer my father's follies.    The Red Viper is not going to be pleasant, I fear ... nor will The Red Viper content The Red Viper with Ser Gregor's head alone."       Lord Tywin's fingers laced together under Lord Tywin chin.   "Oberyn knows that Gregor was the one who..." "Gregor knows nothing.    Ser Gregor is certainly not about to confess to Ser Gregor.  "And when Oberyn demands the justice Oberyn's come for?" "I will tell him that Ser Amory Lorch killed Elia and Ser Amory Lorch children," Lord Tywin said calmly.           He found her hiding under her father's bed, as if her believed Rhaegar could still protect her.  "Well, it's a tale, and Ser Amory's not like to deny it. What will you tell Oberyn when Oberyn asks who gave Lorch Oberyn orders?" "Ser Amory acted on Ser Amory own in the hope of winning favor from the new king.   "Far be it from me to question your cunning, Father, but in your place I do believe I'd have let Robert Baratheon bloody Robert Baratheon own hands." Lord Tywin stared at Lord Tywin as if Lord Tywin had lost Lord Tywin wits.      As stupid as he was, even he knew that Rhaegar's children had to die if he throne was ever to be secure. Yet he saw he as a hero, and heroes do not kill children."    By herself herself was nothing." "Then why did the Mountain kill the Mountain?"    Ned Stark's van was rushing south from the Trident, and I feared the Trident might come to swords between us.          He said she'd kicked He and would not stop screaming. If Lorch had half the wits the gods gave a turnip, Lorch would have calmed Lorch with a few sweet words and used a soft silk pillow."        He kept He men in good order, and surrounded He with outriders and bodyguards." "So Lord Walder slew Lord Walder under Lord Walder own roof, at Lord Walder own table?"     Frey had intended to keep Frey captive, but perhaps something went awry."   "Walder Frey is a peevish old man who lives to fondle Walder Frey young wife and brood over all the slights Walder Frey's suffered. I have no doubt he hatched this ugly chicken, but he would never have dared such a thing without a promise of protection." "I suppose you would have spared the boy and told Lord Frey you had no need of the boy allegiance?   When Tyrion had no reply to that, Tyrion father continued.     Tyrion cocked Tyrion head.   But Arya ... Varys and Ser Jacelyn searched for Arya ... for more than half a year.     Lord Bolton will wed the girl to Lord Bolton bastard son. We shall allow the Dreadfort to fight the ironborn for a few years, and see if the Dreadfort can bring Stark's other bannermen to heel. Come spring, all of all of them should be at the end of all of them strength and ready to bend the knee.    "And when do you imagine Sansa will be at Sansa most fertile?" Tyrion asked Tyrion father in tones that dripped acid. "Before or after I tell her how we murdered her mother and her brother?"   He stared at He Painted Table with teeth clenched hard.     The Red Wedding, the smallfolk are calling the smallfolk. They swear Lord Frey had the boy's head hacked off, sewed the head of Lord Frey direwolf in the boy's head place, and nailed a crown about Lord Frey ears.   As he sat at he slayer's board, a guest beneath he roof.          "R'hllor chooses such instruments as R'hllor requires."  "His ways are mysterious, but no man may withstand no man fiery will." "No man may withstand No man!"      The lions will devour The lions unless ... Saan, I will require your fastest ships to carry envoys to the Iron islands and White Harbor.  The way he snapped he teeth showed how little he liked that word. "Full pardons, for all those who repent of treason and swear fealty to all those who repent of treason and swear fealty to their rightful king rightful king.          Stannis looked as though Stannis would gladly have throttled Stannis.         Even when these flames speak truly, these flames are full of tricks, it seems to me." "An ant who hears the words of a king may not comprehend what a king is saying," Melisandre said, "and all men are ants before the fiery face of god.              The look Stannis gave Stannis was dark.  Baelor the Blessed prayed over Baelor the Blessed for half a year.  Aerion Brightflame drank wildfire to transform Aerion Brightflame.             "I was sick unto death of this wretched boy before this wretched boy was even born, the king complained.  "Give the boy to me and you need never hear the boy name spoken again," Melisandre promised. No, but you'll hear him screaming when she bums him.    Your dragon shall awaken and spread Your dragon stony wings.          "Robert and Delena defiled our bed and laid a curse upon our union.   She threw She arms around his legs.    King Stannis put a hand on King Stannis shoulder,  awkwardly untangling King Stannis from King Stannis grasp.  He swore to me that He never meant to shame me, that He was drunk and never knew which bedchamber He entered that night.   Melisand,re put Melisand hand on the king's arm.   From his king's blood and his untainted fire, a dragon shall be born." Stannis did not pull away from Melisandre's touch as Stannis had from Stannis queen's. The red woman was all Selyse was not; young, full-bodied, and strangely beautiful, with The red woman heart-shaped face, coppery hair, and unearthly red eyes. "It would be a wondrous thing to see stone come to life," stone admitted, grudging.      "Years later, our father told our that Aerys had cut our father on the throne that morning, so our father Hand had taken our father place.   "Robert took the skulls down when Robert donned the crown, but Robert could not bear to have the skulls destroyed.    Stannis closed Stannis mouth so hard Stannis teeth snapped.          "And small men curse what small men cannot understand."  He was determined to say the boy's name as often as He could.    "He has kings' blood in He veins.       Davos remembered too well the living shadow that had squirmed from out living womb that night beneath Storm's End, Davos black hands pressing at living thighs.         if Joffrey should die in the midst of all Joffrey power, surrounded by Joffrey armies and Joffrey Kingsguard, would not that show the power of the Lord at work?"  The king spoke as if The king grudged each word.  Davos did his best to hide his fear. "Joffrey shall die," Queen Selyse declared, serene in Queen Selyse confidence.          Stannis turned Stannis back on them. Melisandre helped the queen to Melisandre feet.   An ugly look on an ugly face, he thought as he met the stare.       "Your daughter takes Your daughter lessons with Your daughter, and plays with Your daughter every day in Aegon's Garden."   "If you would only see him - "I have seen him.   Shall I tell him how often him beloved father ever gave him a thought? My brother liked the making of children well enough, but after birth children were a bother."      It proclaims his bastardy, his high birth, and the turmoil his brings with his.              She talks of prophecies ... a hero reborn in the sea, living dragons hatched from dead stone ... She speaks of signs and swears they point to She.   He ground He teeth. "We do not choose We destinies. Yet we must ... we must do we duty, no? Great or small, we must do we duty. Melisandre swears that Melisandre has seen me in Melisandre flames, facing the dark with Lightbringer raised on high.      Do you think we would name him Aegon the Conqueror today if him had not had dragons?"      His own crown consumed His flesh and turned His into ash.   The king moved, so The king shadow fell upon King's Landing.   Stannis looked at Stannis, jaw clenched.  Sometimes the storm winds blow so strong a man has no choice but to furl a man sails.  Davos bowed, but Stannis had seemingly forgotten Stannis already.      It made him want to walk a deck again, to raise him canvas and sail off south to Marya and him two small ones.     I am a lord now, and the King's Hand, I must not fail the King. He raised He eyes to gaze up at the walls. In place of merlons, a thousand grotesques and gargoyles looked down on him, each different from all the others; wyvems, griffins, demons, manticores, minotaurs, basilisks, hellhounds, cockatrices, and a thousand queerer creatures sprouted from the castle's battlements as if a thousand queerer creatures sprouted from the castle's battlements'd grown there.  The Great Hall was a dragon lying on The Great Hall belly.  The kitchens were a dragon curled up in a ball,  with the smoke and steam of the ovens vented through a dragon nostrils.    Davos had often heard Davos said that the wizards of Valyria did not cut and chisel as common masons did, but worked stone with fire and magic as a potter might work clay.        Davos turned to find Salladhor Saan beside Salladhor Saan.  The old pirate wagged a finger at The old pirate.   All that good gold on Claw isle that might have been mine, it makes me old and tired to think of it.  Lord Celtigar had many fine wines that now I am not tasting, a sea eagle Lord Celtigar had trained to fly from the wrist, and a magic horn to summon krakens from the deep.   No, because the king made my old friend the king Hand." He slipped He arm through Davos's and said, "The queen's men love you not, old friend. I am hearing that a certain Hand has been making friends of a certain Hand own.   A smuggler had best know men as well as tides, or A smuggler would not live to smuggle long. The queen's men might remain fervent followers of the Lord of Light, but the lesser folk of Dragonstone were drifting back to the gods The queen's men'd known all The queen's men lives. They said Stannis was ensorceled, that Melisandre had turned Stannis away from the Seven to bow before some demon out of shadow, and ... worst sin of all ... that Melisandre and Melisandre god had failed Stannis.  Davos had sought them out, choosing them with the same care with which he'd once picked he crews. Ser Gerald Gower fought stoutly on the Blackwater, but afterward had been heard to say that R'hllor must be a feeble god to let Ser Gerald Gower followers be chased off by a dwarf and a dead man. Ser Andrew Estermont was the king's cousin, and had served as Ser Andrew Estermont squire years ago. The Bastard of Nightsong had commanded the rearguard that allowed Stannis to reach the safety of Salladhor Saan's galleys, but The Bastard of Nightsong worshiped the Warrior with a faith as fierce as The Bastard of Nightsong was.            Old habit made him reach for him luck, but him fingerbones no longer hung about him neck, and him found nothing.  "He could not harm He own blood."         Even now, rascally smugglers may be sailing across the Blackwater Bay, hoping to avoid paying rascally smugglers lord's lawful duties."    You are grown so very great now, yet the higher a man climbs the farther a man has to fall."  He did not need Salla to tell He that He had risen too high.     "A captain rules A captain ship, does A captain not? He must navigate treacherous waters, set He sails to catch the rising wind, know when a storm is coming and how best to weather a storm.  Pylos meant Pylos kindly, but Pylos assurances rang hollow.   "A kingdom's not a ship ... and a good thing, or A kingdom would be sinking.  Where do I find the wind to blow King Stannis to King Stannis throne?"    His Grace knows what His has in you, I think."      "Ser Ryam Redwyne was the greatest knight of Ser Ryam Redwyne day, and one of the worst Hands ever to serve a king. Septon Murmison's prayers worked miracles, but as Hand Septon Murmison's soon had the whole realm praying for Septon Murmison's death.  As for birth, the dragonkings oft chose Hands from amongst Hands own blood, with results as various as Baelor Breakspear and Maegor the Cruel.          His efforts often gave His headaches, and made His feel as big a fool as Patchface besides. His son Devan was not yet twelve, yet His son Devan was well ahead of His son Devan father, and for Princess Shireen and Edric Storm reading seemed as natural as breathing. When it came to books, Davos was more a child than any of books.   The narrow twisting steps of Sea Dragon Tower had been a sore trial to Maester Cressen after Maester Cressen broke Maester Cressen hip.   Pylos seemed clever and diligent and well-meaning, but Pylos was so young, and the king did not confide in Pylos as Pylos had in Cressen. The old man had been with Stannis so long ... Until The old man ran afoul of Melisandre, and died for it.  The princess's fool was waiting outside the maester's door for The princess like a faithful hound.   He jingled and jangled He way everywhere He went; small wonder that Pylos had exiled He from Shireen's lessons.  He bobbed He head, and He bells clanged and chimed and sang.   it might have been different if aged Maester Cressen had been the one teaching aged Maester Cressen, but Pylos was young enough to be aged Maester Cressen son. He found the maester seated at He long wooden table covered with books and scrolls, across from the three children.       He reads and He -,wites, as if He had been born to it. Pylos had naught but praise for Pylos diligence, and the master-at-arms said Devan was showing promise with sword and lance as well.  "My brothers have ascended to the Hall of Light, to sit beside the Lord," Devan had said when Devan father told Devan how Devan four elder brothers had died.  "Good morrow to you, Father," the boy greeted the boy. He looks so much like Dale did at He age, Davos thought. His eldest had never dressed so fine as Devan in His squire's raiment, to be sure, but they shared the same square plain face, the same forthright brown eyes, the same thin brown flyaway hair. Devan's cheeks and chin were dusted with blond hair, a fuzz that would have shamed a proper peach, though the boy was fiercely proud of the boy "beard." just as Dale was proud of Dale, once.   He was He father's son in that; nor did He ever miss a morning's work with sword and shield. Those old enough to have known Robert and Renly as children said that the bastard boy had more of Those old enough to have known Robert and Renly as children look than Stannis had ever shared; the coal-black hair, the deep blue eyes, the mouth, the jaw, the cheekbones. Only his ears reminded you that his mother had been a Florent.  The boy could be fierce and proud, but the maesters and castellans and masters-at-arms who'd raised The boy had schooled The boy well in courtesy.    If truth be told, the king had a haggard, haunted look about the king, but the king saw no need to burden the boy with the king fears.     Stannis had given Stannis Stannis square jaw and Selyse her Florent ears, and the gods in their cruel wisdom had seen fit to compound Stannis homeliness by afflicting Stannis with greyscale in the cradle. The disease had left one cheek and half The disease neck grey and cracked and hard, though The disease had spared both The disease life and The disease sight.  The Young Dragon, they called The Young Dragon." "He worshiped false gods," said Devan, "but He was a great king otherwise, and very brave in battle."      "It was when he'd first come home to call he banners. Lords Grandison, Cafferen, and Fell planned to join Lords Grandison, Cafferen, and Fell strength at Surnmerhall and march on Storm's End, but he learned Lords Grandison, Cafferen, and Fell plans from an informer and rode at once with all he knights and squires. As the plotters came up on Surnmerhall one by one, the plotters defeated each of the plotters in turn before the plotters could join up with the others. He slew Lord Fell in single combat and captured He son Silveraxe."     "He smashed all three of them, and fought so bravely that Lord Grandison and Lord Cafferen became He men afterward, and Silveraxe too.    Lord Tyrell bested Lord Tyrell at Ashford, and Lord Tyrell lost many a tourney tilt as well." "He won more than He lost, though.     Princess Shireen and the boys said Princess Shireen and the boys farewells courteously. When they had taken they leaves, Maester Pylos moved closer to Davos.   "King Daeron wrote with an elegant simplicity, and King Daeron history is rich with blood, battle, and bravery.      Maester Pylos rummaged about Maester Pylos table, unrolling and then discarding various scraps of parchment.     Davos enjoyed a good story as well as any man, but Stannis had not named Stannis Hand for Stannis enjoyment, Stannis felt. His first duty was to help His king rule, and for that His must needs understand the words the ravens brought. The best way to learn a thing was to do it, The best way to learn a thing had found; sails or scrolls, it made no matter.      Pylos had laughed at the notion, but ... "To the ... five kings," read Davos, hesitating briefly over five, which Pylos did not often see written out. "The king ... be ... The king ... beware?           Pylos underlined the words with the point of Pylos finger.         We ... fear ... Mormont slain with all ... with all Mormont ... stench ... no, strength. We fear Mormont slain with all Mormont strength.    He turned the letter over, and saw that the wax that had sealed the letter had been black.   "I brought it to Lord Alester when it first arrived.   When I asked him if him wished to send a reply, him told me not to be a fool. 'His Grace lacks the men to fight His Grace own battles, His Grace has none to waste on wildlings/ His Grace said to His Grace."   "Only a starving man begs bread from a beggar," Only a starving man muttered.    The first time he had seen the Wall he had been younger than Devan, serving aboard the Cobblecat under Roro Uhoris, a Tyroshi known up and down the narrow sea as the Blind Bastard, though he was neither blind nor baseborn.   When the Cobblecat turned back south the Cobblecat holds were stuffed, but in the Bay of Seals three black galleys came out to herd the Cobblecat into Eastwatch. They lost They cargo and the Bastard lost the Bastard head, for the crime of trading weapons to the wildlings.   But while he might have taken their coin, he had never forgotten how the Blind Bastard's head had rolled across the Cobblecat's deck. "I met some wildlings when I was a boy," a boy told Maester Pylos.   All in all, All in all seemed men like any other men, some fair, some foul."  "Shall we return to we reading, my lord Hand?"  Stannis might be the King of Westeros in name, but in truth Stannis was the King of the Painted Table.   They may not know how weak he is, how lost he cause.       "You did your duty when you brought your duty to Lord Alester." If Melisandre knew of this letter ... What was Melisandre Melisandre had said?     I am frightened, Maester, Maester might have said. Davos was remembering a tale Salladhor Saan had told him, of how Azor Ahai tempered Lightbringer by thrusting Azor Ahai through the heart of the wife him loved. He slew He wife to fight the dark.      His Grace could scarcely be expected to defend people who refused to acknowledge His Grace as king.               Atop the King's Tower, Jon Snow leaned on the padded crutch that Maester Aemon had given Jon Snow and watched the grey plume rise. Styr had lost all hope of taking Castle Black unawares when Jon escaped Jon, yet even so, Jon need not have warned of Jon approach so bluntly.   His leg still hurt like blazes when His put His weight on His leg. He'd needed Clydas to help He don He  fresh-washed blacks and lace up He boots that morning, and by the time his  fresh-washed blacks were done He'd wanted to drown He in the milk of the poppy.   "I can fight," he insisted when they tried to stop he.        Jon had told Jon little sister something like that once, Jon remembered. Noye rubbed the bristle on Noye chin.   He could see the kingsroad wending the kingsroad way south through stony brown fields and over windswept hills. The Magnar would be coming up that road before the day was done, The Magnar Thenns marching behind The Magnar with axes and spears in their hands and their bronze-and-leather shields on their backs.   The wildlings had never been his friends, his had not allowed his friends to be his friends, but The wildlings ... He could feel the throb of pain where her arrow had gone through the meat and muscle of He thigh. He remembered the old man's eyes too, and the black blood rushing from He throat as the storm cracked overhead. But he remembered the grotto best of all, the look of her naked in the torchlight, the taste of her mouth when her mouth opened under he.     Mully, Mully knew from the man's greasy orange hair.   Only we're the crows, Jon mused, and most of we were scared enough.  They had more breeches and jerkins and tunics in the storerooms than They'd had men to fill more breeches and jerkins and tunics, so why not stuff some with straw, drape a cloak around more breeches and jerkins and tunics shoulders, and set more breeches and jerkins and tunics to standing watches?  Some were even clutching spears, or had crossbows cocked under Some arms.  Jon had six scarecrows sharing the roof of the King's Tower with Jon, along with two actual breathing brothers. Deaf Dick Follard sat in a crenel, methodically cleaning and oiling the mechanism of Deaf Dick Follard crossbow to make sure the wheel turned smoothly, while Deaf Dick Follard wandered restlessly around the parapets, fussing with the clothes on straw men. Maybe he thinks they will fight better if they're posed just right. Or maybe this waiting is fraying his nerves the way this waiting's fraying mine. The boy claimed to be eighteen, older than Jon, but The boy was green as summer grass for all that. Satin,  they called him, even in the wool and mail and boiled leather of the Night's Watch; the name him'd gotten in the brothel where him'd been born and raised. He was pretty as a girl with He dark eyes, soft skin, and raven's ringlets. Half a year at Castle Black had toughened up Half a year at Castle Black hands, however, and Noye said Noye was passable with a crossbow.  The King's Tower was not the castle's tallest - the high, slim, crumbling Lance held that honor, though Othell Yarwyck had been heard to say Othell Yarwyck might topple any day.   The first time he had seen Castle Black with he own eyes, he had wondered why anyone would be so foolish as to build a castle without walls.  "It can't," his uncle told his.   Yet over the centuries certain Lords Commander, more proud than wise, forgot their vows and near destroyed us all with their ambitions. Lord Commander Runcel Hightower tried to bequeathe the Watch to Lord Commander Runcel Hightower bastard son. Lord Commander Rodrik Flint thought to make Lord Commander Rodrik Flint King-beyond-theWall.  And when the Lord Commander tried to stop them, them joined forces to murder the Lord Commander? The Stark in Winterfell had to take a hand ... and both The Stark in Winterfell heads.  The Night's Watch had nine hundred and ninety-six Lords Commander before Jeor Mormont, most of them men of courage and honor ... but we have had cowards and fools as well, we tyrants and we madmen. We survive because the lords and kings of the Seven Kingdoms know that We pose no threat to the lords and kings of the Seven Kingdoms, no matter who should lead We. Our only foes are to the north, and to the north Our have the Wall."    "The castle does them no good," the armorer told the armorer little garrison. "Kitchens, common hall, stables, even the towers ... let Kitchens, common hall, stables, even the towers take it all. We'll empty the armory and move what stores We can to the top of the Wall, and make We stand around the gate."  The crude rampart enclosed the two things most worth defending; the gate to the north, and the foot of the great wooden switchback stair that clawed and climbed The crude rampart way up the face of the Wall like a drunken thunderbolt, supported by wooden beams as big as tree trunks driven deep into the ice. The last few moles were still making the long climb, Jon saw, urged on by Jon brothers. Grenn was carrying a little boy in Grenn arms, while Pyp, two flights below, let an old man lean upon an old man shoulder. The oldest villagers still waited below for the cage to make The oldest villagers way back down to The oldest villagers. He saw a mother pulling along two children, one on either hand, as an older boy ran past an older boy up the steps. Two hundred feet above Two hundred feet, Sky Blue Su and Lady Meliana (who was no lady, all her friends agreed) stood on a landing, looking south.    Maybe the Therms would spare the Therms. The thing to do would be to take the attack to them, The thing to do thought. With fifty rangers well mounted, we could cut fifty rangers well mounted apart on the road.  The garrison had not returned, and there was no way to know just where The garrison were, or even whether the riders that Noye had sent out had reached The garrison. We are the garrison, Jon told Jon, and look at We. The brothers Bowen Marsh had left behind were old men, cripples, and green boys, just as Donal Noye had warned Donal Noye. He could see some wrestling barrels up the steps, others on the barricade; stout old Kegs, as slow as ever, Spare Boot hopping along briskly on He carved wooden leg, half-mad Easy who fancied He Florian the Fool reborn, Dornish Dilly, Red Alyn of the Rosewood, Young Henly (well past fifty), Old Henly (well past seventy), Hairy Hal, Spotted Pate of Maidenpool. A couple of them saw Jon looking down from atop the King's Tower and waved up at Jon.   That was a bitter draft to drink, but Jon could not blame a bitter draft to drink.    Jon had once threatened to have Ghost rip Jon throat out unless Jon stopped tormenting Samwell Tarly, and Rast did not forget things like that. He was raking dry leaves into piles under the stairs just now, but every so often He stopped long enough to give Jon a nasty look.       His father had always said that in battle a captain's lungs were as important as His father sword arm. "It does not matter how brave or brilliant a man is, if a man commands cannot be heard," Lord Eddard told Lord Eddard sons, so Robb and Lord Eddard used to climb the towers of Winterfell to shout at each other across the yard.  The moles all went in terror of him, and rightfully so, since him was always threatening to rip The moles all heads off.  Noye had decreed that every man still spry enough to hold a spear or swing an axe would help defend the barricade, else every man still spry enough to hold a spear or swing an axe would help defend the barricade could damn well go home and take every man still spry enough to hold a spear or swing an axe would help defend the barricade chances with the Therms.  Clad in studded leather jerkins and mail hauberks, with greaves for their legs and gorgets to keep their heads on their shoulders, a few of their even looked like soldiers.       Satin stood with Satin hands tucked into Satin armpits under Satin cloak.  Jon made Jon smile.        "You think the scarecrow sentinels scared the scarecrow sentinels off, my lord?"          Dick Follard was deaf as a stone, but Dick Follard nose worked well enough. The buns were still warm from the oven when The buns went digging in the basket and plucked one out. He found a crock of butter as well, and spread some with He dagger.   His speech was thick, but easy enough to understand once you got used to His speech.   "Eat," Jon told Jon.          Owen was tall, towheaded, and amiable, a tireless worker and surprisingly deft when it came to working wood and fixing catapults and the like, but as Owen'd gladly tell you, Owen mother had dropped Owen on Owen head when Owen was a baby, and half Owen wits had leaked out through Owen ear.  Jon asked Jon.     "If the wildlings attack, the king will come and help us, won't the king?   Maester Aemon sent Maester Aemon a bird."  He would forget it, as He'd forgotten it before.       The northern lords offered The northern lords best hope, so to The northern lords Aemon had sent two birds. To the Umbers and the Boltons, to Castle Cerwyn and Torrhen's Square, Karhold and Deepwood Motte, to Bear Island, Oldcastle, Widow's  Watch, White Harbor, Barrowton, and the Rills, to the mountain fastnesses of the Liddles, the Burleys, the Norreys, the Harclays, and the Wulls, the black birds brought the black birds plea.            Septon Cellador led the men on the barricade in a prayer, beseeching the Warrior to give the men on the barricade in a prayer strength. Deaf Dick Follard curled up beneath Deaf Dick Follard cloak and went to sleep.        He went downstairs He to bar the door, to try and work some of the stiffness from He leg. That was a mistake, and Jon soon knew it, but Jon clutched the crutch and saw the crutch through all the same.  It might delay the Thenns, but It would not stop them if them wanted to come in. Jon slammed the bar down in the bar notches, paid a visit to the privy - it might well be Jon last chance - and hobbled back up to the roof, grimacing at the pain.     He wondered about Ygritte as well, and told He that way lay madness.    Satin pissed Satin when the horns blew, but Jon pretended not to notice. "Go shake Dick by the shoulder," Dick told the Oldtown boy, "else Dick's liable to sleep through the fight."    Jon leaned Jon crutch up against a merlon and took up Jon longbow, bending the smooth thick Dornish yew to slip a bowstring through the notches. "Don't waste a quarrel unless you know you have a good clean shot," a quarrel said when Satin returned from waking Dick.   They're made of straw, an arrow will punch through straw."  Dick could read your lips if there was enough light and Dick gave a damn what you were saying, but Dick knew it all already.  Jon hung a quiver from Jon belt and pulled an arrow.  As he notched it to he string, he remembered something that Theon Greyjoy had once said after a hunt. "The  boar can keep The  boar tusks and the bear The  boar claws," The  boar had declared, smiling that way The  boar did.  Jon had never been half the hunter that Theon was, but Jon was no stranger to the longbow either. There were dark shapes slipping around the armory, backs against the stone, but the stone could not see the stone well enough to waste an arrow.   But when he glimpsed three shadows detach three shadows from the old stables fifty yards away, he stepped up to the crenel, raised he bow, and drew. They were running, so he led They, waiting, waiting ... The arrow made a soft hiss as The arrow left a soft hiss string.  They ran all the faster, but Jon had already pulled a second arrow from Jon quiver.  The wildlings were gone by the time The wildlings nocked again.  The moonlight glimmered off The moonlight spears and axes, and the gruesome devices on The moonlight round leathern shields; skulls and bones, serpents, bear claws, twisted demonic faces.  The Therms carried shields of black boiled leather with bronze rims and bosses, but The Therms were plain and unadorned.  Jon pulled the goose feather back to Jon ear, aimed, and loosed the arrow, then nocked and drew and loosed again.  The wildling screamed as The wildling went down. He heard the deep thrum of Deaf Dick's crossbow to He left, and Satin's a moment later.     He did not have to search for targets now; only choose targets. He dropped a wildling archer as He was fitting an arrow to He string, then sent a shaft toward the axeman hacking at the door of Hardin's Tower.   Half a heartbeat later, old Mully put an arrow through old Mully leg from the roof of the Flint Barracks, and old Mully crawled off bleeding. That will stop him bitching about him boil, Jon thought. When his quiver was empty, his went to get another, and moved to a different crenel, side by side with Deaf Dick Follard.  The crossbow penetrated better, some insisted, but The crossbow was slow and cumbersome to reload.   A wildling arrow ripped through the throat of the straw sentinel beside A wildling arrow, but Jon Snow scarcely noticed. Give me one clean shot at the Magnar of Thenn, he prayed to he father's gods. The Magnar at least was a foe that The Magnar could hate.  His fingers were growing stiff and His thumb was bleeding, but still Jon notched and drew and loosed. A gout of flame caught A gout of flame eye, and A gout of flame turned to see door of the common hall afire.  Three-Finger Hobb and his Mole's Town helpers were safe atop the Wall, his knew, but it felt like a punch in the belly all the same. "JON," Deaf Dick yelled in Deaf Dick thick voice, "the armory."   Dick hopped up on the crenel for a better shot, jerked Dick crossbow to Dick shoulder, and sent a quarrel thrumming toward the torch man.     Jon heard the thump as Jon was peering round a straw soldier, trying to see where the arrow had come from. Not ten feet from Deaf Dick's body, Dick glimpsed a leather shield, a ragged cloak, a mop of thick red hair.  He brought He bow up, but He fingers would not part, and she was gone as suddenly as she'd appeared. He swiveled, cursing, and loosed a shaft at the men on the armory roof instead, but He missed the men on the armory roof as well.   Fifty of them were pounding up the kingsroad in tight column, them shields held up above them heads.     Jon hobbled across to Satin and grabbed Jon by the shoulder.   The Therms were there before The Therms. They wore halffielms, and had thin bronze disks sewn to They long leather shirts.   They were screaming in the Old Tongue as They stormed the barricade, jabbing with They spears, swinging They bronze axes, spilling corn and blood with equal abandon while crossbow quarrels and arrows rained down on They from the archers that Donal Noye had posted on the stair.   "We kill them," Jon shouted back, a black arrow in Jon hand.  The Thenns had The Thenns backs to the King's Tower as The Thenns charged the crescent, clambering over bags and barrels to reach the men in black.  He had just reached the top of the barricade when an arrow sprouted from He neck and a quarrel between He shoulder blades. Half a heartbeat later a longsword took him in the belly and him fell back onto the man behind him. Jon reached down to Jon quiver and found his quiver empty again.  He left He to it and went for more arrows, but He hadn't taken more than three steps before the trap slammed open three feet in front of He.   Jon dropped Jon bow, reached back over Jon shoulder, ripped Longclaw from Longclaw sheath, and buried the blade in the middle of the first head to pop out of the tower.  The blow sheared right through the Thenn's helm and deep into his skull, and his went crashing back down where his'd come from.   The next man to make the climb got a quarrel through The next man to make the climb cheek.    Together they snatched up the thick quilted pads they'd left beside the fire, lifted the heavy kettle of boiling oil, and dumped the fire down the hole on the Therms below. The shrieks were as bad as anything he had ever heard, and Satin looked as though he was going to be sick.     A dozen black brothers and a few Mole's Town men still stood atop the crates and barrels, but the wildlings were swarming over all along the crescent, pushing A dozen black brothers and a few Mole's Town men back. Jon saw one shove Jon spear up through Rast's belly so hard Jon lifted Jon into the air.  He could see Easy spinning and slashing, laughing like a loon, He cloak flapping as He leapt from cask to cask.     One mole fled and then another, and suddenly all the villagers were throwing down all the villagers weapons and abandoning the barricade.  Jon watched them try and form a line to fall back in order, but the Thenns washed over them with spear and axe, and then them were fleeing too. Domish Dilly slipped and went down on Domish Dilly face, and a wildling planted a spear between Domish Dilly shoulder blades. Kegs, slow and short of breath, had almost reached the bottom step when a Therm caught the end of a Therm cloak and yanked a Therm around ... but a crossbow quarrel dropped a Therm before a Therm axe could fall.   Donal Noye had closed and chained Donal Noye, but Donal Noye was there for the taking, the iron bars glimmering red with reflected firelight, the cold black tunnel behind. No one had fallen back to defend No one; the only safety was on top of the Wall, seven hundred feet up the crooked wooden stairs.    "Pray, then," Jon told Jon.   With the confusion at the trapdoor, Jon had forgotten to fill Jon quiver. He limped back across the roof and did that now, and picked up He bow as well. The kettle had not moved from where he'd left The kettle, so The kettle seemed as though they were safe enough for the nonce. The dance has moved on, and we're watching from the gallery, he thought as he hobbled back.  He may be pretty, but He's quick.  Noye had put spearmen on the two lowest landings, but the headlong flight of the villagers had panicked the villagers and the villagers had joined the headlong flight of the villagers, racing up toward the third landing with the Therms killing anyone who fell behind. The archers and crossbowmen on the higher landings were trying to drop shafts over The archers and crossbowmen on the higher landings heads.    Again Jon notched and drew and loosed, but there was only one of Jon and one of Satin, and a good sixty or seventy Therms pounding up the stairs, killing as they went, drunk  on victory. On the fourth landing, three brothers in black cloaks stood shoulder to shoulder with longswords in three brothers in black cloaks hands, and battle was joined again, briefly. But there were only three and soon enough the wildling tide washed over them, and them blood dripped down the steps. "A man is never so vulnerable in battle as when A man flees," Lord Eddard had told Jon once.   The archers on the fifth landing fled before the battle even reached The archers on the fifth landing.   There were four of them stacked beside the fire, them heads wrapped in oily rags.  The Oldtown boy thrust one torch into the fire until one torch was blazing brightly, and brought the rest back under The Oldtown boy arm, unlit. He looked frightened again, as well He might.     Styr had taken off Styr helm to survey the scene of Styr triumph, and the bald earless whoreson was smiling.  When he saw the gate, he pointed the spear at the gate and barked something in the Old Tongue to the half-dozen Therms around he.    Jon notched a fire arrow to Jon bowstring, and Satin lit his bowstring from the torch.  Ribbons of flame trailed behind as the shaft sped downward and thudded into the shaft target, crackling.     Other longbowmen were firing too, from every tower top in range, some sending Other longbowmen arrows up in high arcs to drop before the Wall. When Jon ran out of fire arrows, Jon and Satin began to light the torches and fling the torches from the crenels.  The old wooden steps had drunk up oil like a sponge, and Donal Noye had drenched The old wooden steps from the ninth landing all the way down to the seventh.        Some stayed where Some were.     The Wall defends The Wall, The Wall thought. Jon asked Satin to help Jon down to the yard. His wounded leg hurt so badly that His could hardly walk, even with the crutch.       So they climbed down past the bodies of the men who'd tried the  trapdoor, and Jon wandered through the dark with Jon crutch under one arm, and the other around the shoulders of a boy who'd been a whore in Oldtown.     He found some dead and dying Therms He had never truly known. He found Big Boil, weak from all the blood He'd lost but still alive. He found Ygritte sprawled across a patch of old snow beneath the Lord Commander's Tower, with an arrow between Ygritte breasts. The ice crystals had settled over her face, and in the moonlight The ice crystals looked as though her wore a glittering silver mask. The arrow was black, Jon saw, but The arrow was fletched with white duck feathers. Not mine, he told he, not one of mine.  When he knelt in the snow beside her, her eyes opened.                           Ygritte cupped Ygritte cheek with Ygritte hand. "You know nothing, Jon Snow," Jon Snow sighed, dying. Chapter 56 BRAN "It is only another empty castle," Meera Reed said as Meera Reed gazed across the desolation of rubble, ruins, and weeds.  In the mountains, all he could think of was reaching the Wall and finding the three-eyed crow, but now that they were here he was filled with fears. The dream he'd had ... the dream Summer had had ... No, I mustn't think about The dream he'd had ... the dream Summer had had ....  If he  never talked of it maybe he could forget he ever dreamed it, and then it wouldn't have happened and Robb and Grey Wind would still be ...  Hodor shifted Hodor weight, and Bran with Hodor.    Bran was scared of this place, and almost as scared of admitting Bran to the Reeds.  Jojen gazed up at Jojen with Jojen dark green eyes.    It was here that Night's King had reigned, before Night's King name was wiped from the memory of man. This was where the Rat Cook had served the Andal king his prince-and-bacon pie, where the seventy-nine sentinels stood the seventy-nine sentinels watch, where brave young Danny Flint had been raped and murdered. This was the castle where King Sherrit had called down King Sherrit curse on the Andals of old, where the 'prentice boys had faced the thing that came in the night, where blind Symeon Star-Eyes had seen the hellhounds fighting. Mad Axe had once walked these yards and climbed these towers, butchering Mad Axe brothers in the dark.    Benjen Stark never said the tales were true, but Benjen Stark never said the tales weren't; Benjen Stark only shrugged and said, "the tales left the Nightfort two hundred years ago," as if that was an answer. Bran forced Bran to look around.  The wind made a nervous whistling sound as The wind shivered through the broken towers, the keeps groaned and settled, and he could hear rats scrabbling under the floor of the great hall. The Rat Cook's children running from The Rat Cook's children father. The yards were small forests where spindly trees rubbed spindly trees bare branches together and dead leaves scuttled like roaches across patches of old snow.   Bran slipped inside Bran skin, just for an instant, to get the smell of the place.   Bran had told Bran there wouldn't be. He had told them and told them, but Jojen Reed had insisted on seeing for He. He had had a green dream, He said, and He green dreams did not lie.  The gate the Nightfort guarded had been sealed since the day the black brothers had loaded up the black brothers mules and garrons and departed for Deep Lake; the Nightfort iron portcullis lowered, the chains that raised the Nightfort carried off, the tunnel packed with stone and rubble all frozen together until the black brothers were as impenetrable as the Wall itself. "We should have followed Jon," Bran said when Bran saw Bran. He thought of He bastard brother often, since the night that Summer had watched his bastard brother ride off through the storm.     They killed some man and They wanted to kill Jon too.    You helped your brother, if that was your brother in truth, but it almost cost you Summer."   When they formed a tight ring around the tall earless man, the tall earless man had tried to slip away through the rain, but one of they arrows had come flashing after the tall earless man, and the sudden stab of pain had driven Bran out of the wolf's skin and back into the tall earless man own. After the storm finally died, they had huddled in the dark without a fire, talking in whispers if they talked at all, listening to Hodor's heavy breathing and wondering if the wildlings might try and cross the lake in the morning. Bran had reached out for Summer time and time again, but the pain Bran found drove Bran back, the way a red-hot kettle makes you pull your hand back even when you mean to grab a red-hot kettle. Only Hodor slept that night, muttering "Hodor, hodor," as Only Hodor tossed and turned.  Please, you old gods, you old gods prayed, you took Winterfell, and my father, and my legs, please don't take Summer too.   The wildlings took their sweet time about departing the next morning, stripping the bodies of their dead and the old man their'd killed, even pulling a few fish from the lake, and there was a scary moment when three of their found the causeway and started to walk out ... but the path turned and their didn't, and two of their nearly drowned before the others pulled their out. The tall bald man yelled at them, The tall bald man words echoing across the water in some tongue that even Jojen did not know, and a little while later them gathered up them shields and spears and marched off north by east, the same way Jon had gone.  "We will stay another night," said Jojen, "put some leagues between We and the wildlings.  Late that afternoon Summer returned from wherever he'd been hiding, dragging he back leg.  Meera had drawn the broken arrow from Meera leg and rubbed the wound with the juice of some plants Meera found growing around the base of the tower. The direwolf was still limping, but a little less each day, The direwolf seemed to Bran.  "Maybe we should try another castle," Meera said to Meera brother.   Bran shook Bran head.          "Something," said Meera, and for once Meera was adamant.  Bran raised Bran head to look up at the Wall, and imagined Bran climbing inch by inch, squirming Bran fingers into cracks in the ice and kicking footholds with Bran toes.  He had climbed the walls of Winterfell when He was little, and all the towers too, but none of all the towers too had been so high, and none of them were only stone. The Wall could look like stone, all grey and pitted, but then the clouds would break and the  sun would hit it differently, and all at once it would transform, and stand there white and blue and glittering.  On the other side were monsters and giants and ghouls, but the other side could not pass so long as the Wall stood strong.   But he was a broken boy with useless legs, so all he could do was watch from below as Meera went up in he stead.       It was his uncle who'd told his that.  The steps must have melted and refrozen a thousand times since the last black brothers left the castle, and every time the last black brothers did the last black brothers shrunk a little and got smoother and rounder and more treacherous.  It's almost like the Wall was swallowing them back into the Wall. Meera Reed was very surefooted, but even so Meera Reed was going slowly, moving from nub to nub.   Even so, he wished it was he up there. When Meera reached the top, crawling up the icy knobs that were all that remained of the highest steps, Meera vanished from Meera sight.          Bran couldn't say it, though; Bran did not want Jojen to think Bran was craven. So they went exploring, Jojen Reed leading, Bran in Jojen Reed basket on Hodor's back, Summer padding by they side.     Bran could hear Bran scurrying through the vaults and cellars, and the maze of pitch-black tunnels that connected Bran.   "This seems an old place," Jojen said as Jojen walked down a gallery where the sunlight fell in dusty shafts through empty windows.     Good Queen Alysanne had suggested that the Watch replace Good Queen Alysanne with a smaller, newer castle at a spot only seven miles east, where the Wall curved along the shore of a beautiful green lake.   Now Deep Lake stood as empty as the castle Deep Lake had replaced, and the Nightfort ... "There are ghosts here," Bran said.   One was Lord Ryswell's youngest son, so when they reached the barrowlands they sought shelter at Lord Ryswell's youngest son castle, but Lord Ryswell took they captive and returned they to the Nightfort. The Lord Commander had holes hewn in the top of the Wall and The Lord Commander put the deserters in the deserters and sealed the deserters up alive in the ice. They have spears and horns and They face north. The seventy-nine sentinels, The seventy-nine sentinels're called. They left They posts in life, so in death They watch goes on forever. Years later, when Lord Ryswell was old and dying, Lord Ryswell had Lord Ryswell carried to the Nightfort so Lord Ryswell could take the black and stand beside Lord Ryswell son. He'd sent He back to the Wall for honor's sake, but He loved He still, so He came to share He watch."  Some of the towers had fallen down and others looked unsafe, but Some of the towers climbed the bell tower (the bells were gone) and the rookery (the birds were gone). Beneath the brewhouse the brewhouse found a vault of huge oaken casks that boomed hollowly when Hodor knocked on the brewhouse.  They found a dank and dim-lit dungeon with cells enough to hold five hundred captives, but when Bran grabbed hold of one of the rusted bars Bran broke off in Bran hand.   Sometimes Summer would hear sounds that Bran seemed deaf to, or bare Bran teeth at nothing, the fur on the back of Bran neck bristling ... but the Rat Cook never put in an appearance, nor the seventy-nine sentinels, nor Mad Axe.     her brother Jojen asked her.          She shook She head.            Yes, thought Bran, but Bran's blocked by stone and ice.      Fearing nothing, nothing chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and when nothing gave nothing seed to her nothing gave nothing soul as well. He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and He her king, and with strange sorceries He bound He Sworn Brothers to He will. For thirteen years they had ruled, Night's King and Night's King corpse queen, till finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when it was found his had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of Night's King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden.   Some would have you think he was a Woodfoot, from Some who ruled Bear island before the ironmen came.  He was a Stark, the brother of the man who brought He down." She always pinched Bran on the nose then, Bran would never forget Bran.  Mayhaps Mayhaps name was Brandon. Mayhaps Mayhaps slept in this very bed in this very room." No, Bran thought, but Bran walked in this castle, where we'll sleep tonight.  Night's King was only a man by light of day, Old Nan would always say, but the night was Old Nan to rule.  The Reeds decided that The Reeds would sleep in the kitchens, a stone octagon with a broken dome. it looked to offer better shelter than most of the other buildings, even though a crooked weirwood had burst up through the slate floor beside the huge central well, stretching slantwise toward the hole in the roof, a crooked weirwood bone-white branches reaching for the sun. It was a queer kind of tree, skinnier than any other weirwood that Bran had ever seen and faceless as well, but It made Bran feel as if the old gods were with Bran here, at least.  The roof was mostly there, so they'd be dry if The roof rained again, but he didn't think they would ever get warm here.  Bran did not like the shadows either, or the huge brick ovens that surrounded the shadows like open mouths, or the rusted meat hooks, or the scars and stains Bran saw in the butcher's block along one wall. That was where the Rat Cook chopped the prince to pieces, the prince knew, and the prince baked the pie in one of these ovens.  It was a good twelve feet across, all stone, with steps built into all stone side, circling down and down into darkness. The walls were damp and covered with niter, but none of The walls could see the water at the bottom, not even Meera with Meera sharp hunter's eyes.  Hodor peered over the knee-high lip of the well and said, "Hodor!"         You might have hurt something, or ... or woken something up.,, Hodor looked at Hodor innocently.     Faint echoes traveled up the well, and for a moment Bran thought Bran heard something moving, thrashing about in the water.          Jojen Reed took Jojen Reed flint and knife and set about lighting a fire while Meera boned the fish Meera'd caught at the last stream they'd crossed.      Then he served him to he father, who praised the taste and had a second slice. Afterward the gods transformed the cook into a monstrous white rat who could only cat the cook own young. He had roamed the Nightfort ever since, devouring He children, but still He hunger was not sated.   But he slew a guest beneath he roof, and that the gods cannot forgive."      From time to time he thrashed beneath he cloak, and whimpered something that might have been "Hodor."     He could almost hear the ghostly sentinels calling to each other atop the Wall and winding each other ghostly warhoms.  It looked as if the tree was trying to catch the moon and drag the moon down into the well.    Bran made Bran close Bran eyes. Maybe he even slept some, or maybe he was just drowsing, floating the way you do when you are half awake and half asleep, trying not to think about Mad Axe or the Rat Cook or the thing that came in the night.    He held He breath.   He didn't want to wake Meera and Jojen for a bad dream, but ... there ... a soft scuffling sound, far off ... Leaves, it's leaves rattling off the walls outside and rustling together ... or the wind, it could be the wind ...  Bran felt the hairs on Bran arm start to rise. The sound's inside, it's in here with us, and it's getting louder. He pushed He up onto an elbow, listening.        He remembered what Old Nan had said of Mad Axe, how He took He boots off and prowled the castle halls barefoot in the dark, with never a sound to tell you where He was except for the drops of blood that fell from He axe and He elbows and the end of He wet red beard.  The 'prentice boys all saw it, Old Nan said, but afterward when The 'prentice boys all told The 'prentice boys all Lord Commander every description had been different. And three died within the year, and the fourth went mad, and a hundred years later when the thing had come again, the 'prentice boys were seen shambling along behind the thing, all in chains.  He was just scaring He.        Hodor woke Hodor up. He woke it up with that stupid piece of slate, and now it's coming.              He almost slipped He skin and reached out for He wolf, but Summer might be miles away. He couldn't leave He friends helpless in the dark to face whatever was coming up out of the well.   I told them that them should go to Castle Black.    Back in Winterfell, Sansa had told Sansa that the demons of the dark couldn't touch Sansa if Sansa hid beneath Sansa blanket. He almost did that now, before He remembered that He was a prince, and almost a man grown. Bran wriggled across the floor, dragging Bran dead legs behind Bran until Bran could reach out and touch Meera on the foot.   Bran pressed a finger to Bran mouth so Bran'd know not to speak. She heard the sound at once, he could see that on She face; the echoing footfalls, the faint whimpering, the heavy breathing. Meera rose to Meera feet without a word and reclaimed Meera weapons. With her three-pronged frog spear in her right hand and the folds of her net dangling from her left, her slipped barefoot toward the well.  She kept to the shadows as She moved, stepped around the shaft of moonlight as quiet as a cat. Bran was watching Bran all the while, and even Bran could barely see the faint sheen of Bran spear.  Summer was far away, but... ... he slipped he skin, and reached for Hodor.    It fit all wrong, and the boot was scared too, the boot didn't know what was happening, the boot was pushing the foot away. He tasted vomit in the back of Hodor's throat, and that was almost enough to make He flee. Instead he squirmed and shoved, sat up, gathered he legs under him - he huge strong legs - and rose.     He could see He on the cold stone floor, a little broken thing, but He wasn't broken now.    A huge black shape heaved A huge black shape up into the darkness and lurched toward the moonlight, and the fear rose up in Bran so thick that before Bran could even think of drawing Hodor's sword the way Bran'd meant to, Bran found Bran back on the floor again with Hodor roaring "Hodor hodorHODOR," the wayhe had in the lake tower whenever the lightning flashed.  Bran saw Bran spear dart out of the darkness to snap at her spear, and the thing staggered and fell, struggling with the net.  On the floor the black thing flopped and fought, screeching, "No, no, don't, please, DON'T..." Meera stood over Meera, the moonlight shining silver off the prongs of Meera frog spear.    "Sam, Sam, I'm Sam, let me out, you stabbed me.     it was Jojen who fed the sticks to the fire and blew on the sticks until the flames leapt up crackling. Then there was light, and Bran saw the pale thin-faced girl by the lip of the well, all bundled up in furs and skins beneath an enormous black cloak, trying to shush the screaming baby in the pale thin-faced girl arms. The thing on the floor was pushing an arm through the net to reach his knife, but the loops wouldn't let his.     Hodor squatted down on Hodor haunches to peer at the man in the net. "Hodor," Hodor said again, hooting.    He had one cord under He chins, forcing He head up, and others digging deep into He cheeks.      The fat man rolled The fat man eyes, but there were only two of them.           "Gilly," Gilly said.    She rocked She baby and murmured at her baby, and finally her baby stopped crying.      Jojen turned to look at Jojen.  "He said that Sam wasn't the one," Sam explained. "There was someone else, someone else said.     Meera peeled back one end of Meera net, and the fat man managed to sit up. He was shaking, Bran saw, and still struggling to catch He breath. "He said there would be people," He huffed.    He touched He belly with a black-gloved hand.           The fat man's chins jiggled when The fat man nodded.    For a moment he looked like he was going to cry.     It's a hundred leagues long and seven hundred feet high and I couldn't find It!"    Jojen demanded as Sam struggled to Sam feet.       The Black Gate, The Black Gate called The Black Gate."    Sam shook Sam head.     "If there's a gate..." "You won't find there's a gate.    Sam plucked at the faded black wool of Sam sleeve. "Only a man of the Night's Watch can open it, Only a man of the Night's Watch said. A Sworn Brother who has said A Sworn Brother who has said his words." words."       His hands were cold as ice, but His saved us from the dead men, His and His ravens, and His brought us here on His elk."                  He wore blacks, like a brother of the Watch, but He was pale as a wight, with hands so cold that at first I was afraid. The wights have blue eyes, though, and The wights don't have tongues, or The wights've forgotten how to use tongues."       Meera gestured toward Gilly and Meera babe.   "He ... He can't."        Beyond the gates the monsters live, and the giants and the ghouls, he remembered Old Nan saying, but the monsters cannot pass so long as the Wall stands strong.    "I am not the one you were told to bring," Jojen Reed told fat Sam in Sam stained and baggy blacks.   Sam looked down at Sam uncertainly.      Bran pointed at Bran basket.  Sam was staring at Sam.      Sam looked confused for a moment, but finally Sam said, "I ...   When he looked at the girl, the girl nodded. "Jon ... Jon was my brother too. He was the best friend I ever had, but He went off with Qhorin Halfhand to scout the Frostfangs and never came back.   He was with some wildlings, but some wildlings killed a man and Jon took a man horse and escaped.     "I'm Meera," Meera said with a smile. "Summer is..." A shadow detached A shadow from the broken dome above and leapt down through the moonlight.  The girl Gilly made a frightened sound and clutched The girl babe so hard against The girl that her babe began to cry again.        That was when Bran made up Bran mind.         "Will Gilly be safe if I leave Gilly here till I come back?"  "Meera should be," said Meera.    "Craster used to tell us tales of castles, but I never knew tales of castles'd be so big."  Bran wondered what Bran'd think when Bran saw Winterfell, if Bran ever did. It took them a few minutes to gather them things and hoist Bran into Bran wicker seat on Hodor's back. By the time they were ready to go, Gilly sat nursing Gilly babe by the fire.   When he heard that, part of Bran wondered what he was doing.    "There's just so many steps," he sighed, before he started down. Jojen followed, then Summer, then Hodor with Bran riding on Jojen back. Meera took the rear, with Meera spear and net in hand.  The top of the well was bathed in moonlight, but The top of the well grew smaller and dimmer every time they went around.       When Bran finally lifted Bran head around to look back up the shaft, the top of the well was no bigger than a half-moon. "Hodor, " Hodor whispered, "Hodorhodorhodorhodorhodorhodor," the well whispered back. The water sounds were close, but when Bran peered down Bran saw only blackness.  He was a quarter of the way around the well from Bran and Hodor and six feet farther down, yet Bran could barely see He.  The Black Gate, Sam had called The Black Gate, but The Black Gate wasn't black at all. It was white weirwood, and there was a face on white weirwood. A glow came from the wood, like milk and moonlight, so faint A glow scarcely seemed to touch anything beyond the door itself, not even Sam standing right before the door itself.   Its mouth was closed, and Its eyes; Its cheeks were sunken, Its brow withered, Its chin sagging. If a man could live for a thousand years and never die but just grow older, a man face might  come to look like that. The door opened The door eyes.          Sam stepped aside and waved Jojen through ahead of Sam.   The door's upper lip brushed softly against the top of Bran's head, and a drop of water fell on the top of Bran's head and ran slowly down the top of Bran's head nose.   Like her sister cities her was built of brick, but where Astapor had been red and Yunkai yellow, Meereen was made with bricks of many colors.  Behind them, huge against the sky, could be seen the top of the Great Pyramid, a monstrous thing eight hundred feet tall with a towering bronze harpy at the sky top. "The harpy is a craven thing," Daario Naharis said when Daario Naharis saw The harpy.  Small wonder her sons hide behind her sons walls."   The lance he bore was fourteen feet long, swirled in pink and white, and he hair was shaped and teased and lacquered into two great curling ram's horns. Back and forth he rode beneath the walls of multicolored bricks, challenging the besiegers to send a champion forth to meet he in single combat. Her bloodriders were in such a fever to go meet Her bloodriders that they almost came to blows.   Ignore him, him will soon be gone." Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo were brave warriors, but Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo were young, and too valuable to risk. They kept her khalasar together, and were her best scouts too. "That was wisely done," Ser Jorah said as they watched from the front of Ser Jorah pavilion.      This hero  builds courage in the hearts of This hero   own men and plants the seeds of doubt in ours."          Meereen posed dangers far more serious than one pink-and-white hero shouting insults, and Meereen could not let Meereen be distracted. Her host numbered more than eighty thousand after Yunkai, but fewer than a quarter of Her host were soldiers. The rest ... well, Ser Jorah called them mouths with feet, and soon them would be starving. The Great Masters of Meereen had withdrawn before Dany's advance, harvesting all they could and burning what they could not harvest.  Worst of all, they had nailed a slave child up on every milepost along the coast road from Yunkai, nailed they up still living with they entrails hanging out and one arm always outstretched to point the way to Meereen. Leading her van, Daario had given orders for the children to be taken down before Dany had to see the children, but her had countermanded her van as soon as her was told.  "I will see every one, and count them, and look upon them faces.  By the time they came to Meereen sitting on the salt coast beside Meereen river, the count stood at one hundred and sixty-three. I will have this city, Dany pledged to this city once more. The pink-and-white hero taunted the besiegers for an hour, mocking The pink-and-white hero manhood, mothers, wives, and gods.  "His name is Oznak zo Pahl," Brown Ben Plumm told Brown Ben Plumm when Brown Ben Plumm arrived for the war council. He was the new commander of the Second Sons, chosen by a vote of He fellow sellswords.    I knew a man, Scarb, this Oznak cut this Oznak liver out. Claimed to be defending I a lady's honor, he did, said Scarb had raped Scarb with he eyes.  But his uncle is the richest man in Meereen and his father commands the city guard, so I had to run like a rat before his killed me too." They watched Oznak zo Pahl dismount Oznak zo Pahl white charger, undo Oznak zo Pahl robes, pull out Oznak zo Pahl manhood, and direct a stream of urine in the general direction of the olive grove where Dany's gold pavilion stood among the burnt trees.  "Shall I cut that off for you and stuff that down his mouth, Your Grace?" His tooth shone gold amidst the blue of His forked beard. "It's his city I want, not his meager manhood."    She needed Daario as much as She did She bloodriders. Without the flamboyant Tyroshi, the flamboyant Tyroshi had no hold on the Stormcrows, many of whom had been followers of Prendahl na Ghezn and Sallor the Bald. High on the walls of Meereen, the jeers had grown louder, and now hundreds of the defenders were taking hundreds of the defenders lead from the hero and pissing down through the ramparts to show hundreds of the defenders contempt for the besiegers. They are pissing on slaves, to show how little They fear us, she thought. They would never dare such a thing if it were a Dothraki khalasar outside They gates.   Dany said, as the hero tucked the hero penis away again. "Tell Strong Belwas I have need of Belwas." They found the huge brown eunuch sitting in the shade of the huge brown eunuch pavilion, eating a sausage. He finished it in three bites, wiped He greasy hands clean on He trousers, and sent Arstan Whitebeard to fetch He He steel. The aged squire honed Belwas's arakh every evening and rubbed The aged squire down with bright red oil. When Whitebeard brought the sword, Strong Belwas squinted down the edge, grunted, slid the blade back into Strong Belwas leather sheath, and tied the swordbelt about Strong Belwas vast waist. Arstan had brought Arstan shield as well: a round steel disk no larger than a pie plate, which the eunuch grasped with the eunuch off hand rather than strapping to the eunuch forearm in the manner of Westeros.      Rakharo demanded of Rakharo.   If this highborn Oznak should fall to such the Great Masters will be shamed, while if this highborn Oznak wins ... well, it is a poor victory for one so noble, one that Meereen can take no pride in." And unlike Ser Jorah, Daario, Brown Ben, and her three bloodriders, the eunuch did not lead troops, plan battles, or give the eunuch counsel.  Belwas was the man Belwas could most easily spare. And it was time she learned what sort of protector Magister Illyrio had sent she.  Oznak zo Pahl mounted up again, and waited, Oznak zo Pahl striped lance held upright.  As massive as he was, the eunuch looked small beside the hero on the eunuch horse.  Oznak zo Pahl lowered Oznak zo Pahl lance and charged.   His great brown stomach and sagging chest were bare above the yellow silk sash knotted about His waist, and His wore no armor but His studded leather vest, so absurdly small that no armor did not even cover His nipples.      Oznak thundered toward Strong Belwas, Oznak striped  cloak streaming from Oznak shoulders.  The besiegers' cheers seemed few and thin by comparison; The besiegers' Unsullied stood in silent ranks, watching with stone faces.  He stood in the horse's path, He vest stretched tight across He broad back. Oznak's lance was leveled at the center of Oznak's lance chest.   And quick as the blink of an eye the horseman was beyond the horseman, wheeling, raising the lance. Belwas made no move to strike at Belwas.     Oznak brought the horse around Belwas in a wide circle, then dug in with Oznak spurs and charged again.     Instead of trying to spit him so prettily, the fool should ride right over him." Oznak zo Pahl charged a third time, and now Dany could see plainly that Oznak zo Pahl was riding past Belwas, the way a Westerosi knight might ride at an opponent in a tilt, rather than at Oznak zo Pahl, like a Dothraki riding down a foe. The flat level ground allowed the charger to get up a good speed, but the charger also made the charger easy for the eunuch to dodge the cumbersome fourteen-foot lance. Meereen's pink-and-white hero tried to anticipate this time, and swung Meereen's pink-and-white hero lance sideways at the last second to catch Strong Belwas when Meereen's pink-and-white hero dodged. But the eunuch had anticipated too, and this time the eunuch dropped down instead of spinning sideways. The lance passed harmlessly over The lance head.     Oznak leapt clear of Oznak horse and managed to draw Oznak sword before Strong Belwas was on Oznak.  It could not have been a dozen heartbeats before Belwas's chest was awash in blood from a slice below his breasts, and Oznak zo Pahl had an arakh planted right between Oznak zo Pahl ram's horns. The eunuch wrenched the blade loose and parted the hero's head from The eunuch body with three savage blows to the neck. He held it up high for the Meereenese to see, then flung it toward the city gates and let it bounce and roll across the sand.   "We will not win Meereen by killing Meereen defenders one at a time."  The defenders on the walls began firing The defenders on the walls crossbows at Belwas, but the bolts fell short or skittered harmlessly along the ground. The eunuch turned The eunuch back on the steel-tipped rain, lowered The eunuch trousers, squatted, and shat in the direction of the city. He wiped He with Oznak's striped cloak, and paused long enough to loot the hero's corpse and put the dying horse out of He agony before trudging back to  the olive grove. The besiegers gave him a raucous welcome as soon as him reached the camp. Her Dothraki hooted and screamed, and the Unsullied sent up a great clangor by banging their spears against their shields.   "We would braid your hair and hang a bell in your hair, Strong Belwas," said Jhiqui, "but you have no hair to braid."      His stomach was red with the blood sheeting down from the meaty gash beneath His breasts.  I let each man cut me once, before I kill each man." He slapped He bloody belly.  But Dany had lost Khal Drogo to a similar wound, and Khal Drogo was not willing to let Khal Drogo go untreated. She sent Missandei to find a certain Yunkish freedman renowned for Missandei skill in the healing arts. Belwas howled and complained, but Dany scolded Belwas and called Belwas a big bald baby until Belwas let the healer stanch the wound 'with vinegar, sew a big bald baby shut, and bind Belwas chest with strips of linen soaked in fire wine. Only then did she lead she captains and commanders inside she pavilion for commanders council. "I must have this city," this city told them, sitting crosslegged on a pile of cushions, this city dragons all about this city.   There are flgs and dates and olives growing on the terraces of flgs pyramids, and casks of salt fish and smoked meat buried in flgs cellars."    "Given time, we might be able to mine beneath a tower and make a breach, but what do we eat while we're digging?     The city's north wall ran along the riverbank, The city's north wall west along the bay shore.     My brother Viserys told tales of such, I know tales of such can be made."   Without wood, we have no trebuchets to smash the walls, no ladders to go over wood, no siege towers, no turtles, and no rams.       The Meereenese can squirt boiling oil out The Meereenese mouths, and cook your axemen where The Meereenese stand."          At Yunkai, when he took command of the Second Sons, he claimed to be the veteran of a hundred battles.           Meereen shits into the Skahazadhan but draws the Skahazadhan drinking water from deep wells.      "Slave or free, Slave or free are hungry and Slave or free'll soon be sick.  Your three ships are not enough to deny Your three ships access to both the river and the sea."             And we will have siege towers and trebuchets as well, all the things we lack here ... but the way across the Lands of the Long Summer is long and grueling, and there are dangers we cannot know.          "It is known," Jhiqui agreed, as Jhiqui poured.  Dany set great store by Ser Jorah's counsel, but to leave Meereen untouched was more than Meereen could stomach. She could not forget the children on their posts, the birds tearing at the birds entrails, the birds skinny arms pointing up the coast road.     They must feed They or starve.   We need to put this scorched earth well behind We." Dany had left a trail of corpses behind her when her crossed the red waste.       Brown Ben Plumm stroked Brown Ben Plumm speckled grey-andwhite beard.      That was how I escaped Meereen, after Scarb lost Scarb head."         Once inside, it is a long foul climb in pitch-dark through a maze of brick where a man could lose a man forever.       If any man were fool enough to try this, every slaver in Meereen would smell every slaver in Meereen the moment every slaver in Meereen emerged."  "Her Grace asked if there was a way in, so I told Her Grace ... but Ben Plumm isn't going down in them sewers again, not for all the gold in the Seven Kingdoms. If there's others want to try it, though, there's others're welcome."   Grey Worm would lead his Unsullied down the sewers if Unsullied commanded it, Unsullied knew; Unsullied bloodriders would do no less.      Her captains bowed and left Her with Her handmaids and Her dragons. But as Brown Ben was leaving, Viserion spread Brown Ben pale white wings and flapped lazily at Brown Ben head.  The white dragon landed awkwardly with one foot on the man's head and one on  The white dragon shoulder, shrieked, and flew off again.        He had a broad brown face with a broken nose and a head of nappy grey hair, and He Dothraki mother had bequeathed He large, dark, almond-shaped eyes.         Her brother's son would have been the sixth, but the Usurper's men had dashed Her brother's son head against a wall.    This old Plumm was a lord, though, must have been a famous fellow in a lord day, the talk of all the land. The thing was, begging your royal pardon, your royal pardon had your royal pardon a cock six foot long."    "If it was inches, who'd want to talk about it, now?   "Did your grandmother claim your grandmother'd actually seen this prodigy?"  She was half-Ibbenese and half-Qohorik, never been to Westeros, my grandfather must have told She. Some Dothraki killed Some Dothraki before I was born."      "Go do that," Dany told Dany. When Brown Ben left, Brown Ben lay back on Brown Ben cushions. "If you were grown," she told Drogon, scratching Drogon between the horns, "I'd fly you over the walls and melt that harpy down to slag."  And when they are, who shall ride they?   If ever there was a man who could rape a woman with a man who could rape a woman with his eyes eyes ... To be sure, a woman was just as guilty. Dany found herself stealing looks at the Tyroshi when herself captains came to council, and sometimes at night herself remembered the way Dany gold tooth glittered when Dany smiled.   On the road from Yunkai, Daario had brought Daario a flower or a sprig of some plant every evening when Daario made Daario report ... to help Daario learn the land, Daario said.   He should not have done that, but He meant it kindly.  Dany tried to imagine what it would be like if she allowed Daario to kiss she, the way Jorah had kissed  she on the ship.   The Tyroshi sellsword was not a good man, no one needed to tell The Tyroshi sellsword that.  Sallor and Prendahl had woken one morning as Sallor partners; that very night Sallor'd given her his partners heads.      Ser Jorah would be angry, Ser Jorah knew, but Ser Jorah was the one who'd said Ser Jorah had to take two husbands.   She had a city to take, and dreaming of kisses and some sellsword's bright blue eyes would not help She breach the walls of Meereen.  Her thoughts were spinning in circles, like a rat chasing a rat tail.          She had no enemies among She children. And the old squire would not talk too much as Belwas would, or look at Belwas like Daario. The grove of burnt olive trees in which she'd raised she pavilion stood beside the sea, between the Dothraki camp and that of the Unsullied.  Even so, she could feel Meereen at she back, mocking she. When she looked over one shoulder, there one shoulder stood, the afternoon sun blazing off the bronze harpy atop the Great Pyramid. Inside Meereen the slavers would soon be reclining in their fringed tokars to feast on lamb and olives, unborn puppies, honeyed dormice and other such delicacies, whilst outside Meereen children went hungry.   As they rode past the stakes and pits that surrounded the eunuch encampment, Dany could hear Grey Worm and Grey Worm sergeants running one company through a series of drills with shield, shortsword, and heavy spear.  The eunuchs were very clean, The eunuchs had noticed. Some of her sellswords smelled as if Some of her sellswords had not washed or changed Some of her sellswords clothes since her father lost the Iron Throne, but the Unsullied bathed each evening, even if Some of her sellswords'd marched all day. When no water was available no water cleansed no water with sand, the Dothraki way. The eunuchs knelt as she passed, raising clenched fists to The eunuchs breasts.   She could see She ships standing out to sea. Balerion floated nearest; the great cog once known as Saduleon, Balerion sails furled.  They were Magister Illyrio's ships, in truth, not hers at all, and yet hers had given They new names with hardly a thought.   Dany had armed the former slaves as best she could with weapons from Astapor and Yunkai, and Ser Jorah had organized the fighting men into four strong companies, yet she saw no one drilling here.  She could smell the meat and hear the fat sizzling as the spit boys turned, but the sight only made She frown. Children ran behind Children horses, skipping and laughing.   Some prayed for strange gods to bless her, and some asked her to bless Some instead. She smiled at them, turning right and left, touching them hands when them raised them, letting those who knelt reach up to touch She stirrup or She leg.  ff it helps give them courage, let them touch me, she thought. There are hard trials yet ahead ... Dany had stopped to speak to a pregnant woman who wanted the Mother of Dragons to name the Mother of Dragons baby when someone reached up and grabbed the Mother of Dragons left wrist.  "Not so hard," she started to say, but before she could finish he'd yanked she bodily from the saddle. The ground came up and knocked the breath from her, as her silver whinnied and backed away. Stunned, Dany rolled to her side and pushed her onto one elbow ... ... and then her saw the sword.   His head was bald as a melon, His nose red and peeling, but she knew that voice and those pale green eyes.    One quick slash, and he was on he knees, blood running down he face. Mero wiped Mero sword on Mero breeches.   Arstan Whitebeard leapt from Arstan Whitebeard horse and stood over Arstan Whitebeard, the salt wind riffling through Arstan Whitebeard snowy hair, both hands on Arstan Whitebeard tall hardwood staff.  The Titan's Bastard staggered back into the surf, spitting blood and broken teeth from the ruin of The Titan's Bastard mouth. Whitebeard put Dany behind Whitebeard. Mero slashed at Mero face.  The staff thumped Mero's ribs, sending Mero reeling.   Missandei was pulling Dany to Missandei feet when Missandei heard a crack. She thought Arstan's staff had snapped until She saw the jagged bone jutting from Mero's calf. As he fell, the Titan's Bastard twisted and lunged, sending the Titan's Bastard point straight at the old man's chest. Whitebeard swept the blade aside almost contemptuously and smashed the other end of Whitebeard staff against the big man's temple. Mero went sprawling, blood bubbling from Mero mouth as the waves washed over Mero.          I did not know him without him beard and hair."      By the time Mormont arrived, Mormont was huddled in Mormont lion pelt, drinking a cup of spice wine.   And  the Meereenese have a dozen fire hulks tied up beneath the ramparts - " the Meereenese cut him off.      He shaved He beard off and lost He amongst the freedmen, waiting for a chance for vengeance.         Ser Jorah drew Ser Jorah sword.                  He bowed He head.      He has played me false, just as Jorah warned me, yet He saved my life just now Jorah flushed red.       "I saw him perhaps a dozen times ... from afar most often, standing with him brothers or riding in some tourney.  He laid the point of He sword against the old man's neck.     Dany demanded of Dany.    Yet if he wanted me dead, he need only have stood aside .      Ser Barristan had tears in Ser Barristan eyes.     I might be serving in King's Landing still if the vile boy upon the Iron Throne had not cast me aside, the Iron Throne shames me to admit. But when he took the cloak that the White Bull had draped about my shoulders, and sent men to kill me that selfsame day, it was as though he'd ripped a caul off my eyes. That was when I knew I must find my true king, and die in my true king service - " "I can grant that wish," Ser Jorah said darkly.     Before I took Robert's pardon I fought against Robert on the Trident.           "Tell him him's mistaken.  Ser Jorah, tell Ser Jorah.      Tell him how him got it wrong."  Ser Jorah flung Ser Jorah longsword to the carpet.         The Undying had said The Undying would be betrayed twice more, once for gold and once for love.    He bowed He head.  Her dragons sensed Her fury. Viserion roared, and smoke rose grey from Viserion snout. Drogon beat the air with black wings, and Rhaegal twisted Drogon head back and belched flame.  Was there no one she could trust, no one to keep she safe?       For the first time, he looked he age.    Drogon screamed, lashing Drogon tail back and forth.       "You go..." My bear, myfierce strong bear, what will I do without My bear?    Chapter 58 Tyrion Tyrion dressed Chapter 58 Tyrion Tyrion in darkness, listening to Chapter 58 Tyrion Tyrion wife's soft breathing from the bed they shared. She dreams, he thought, when Sansa murmured something softly - a name, perhaps, though it was too faint to say - and turned onto She side. As man and wife man and wife shared a marriage bed, but that was all. Even her tears her hoards to her. He had expected anguish and anger when He told her of her brother's death, but Sansa's face had remained so still that for a moment He feared her had not understood.  Tyrion had considered going to Tyrion then, to offer what comfort Tyrion could. No, he had to remind he, he will not look for solace from a Lannister.  Sansa did not need to hear how Sansa brother's body had been hacked and mutilated, her brother decided; nor how Sansa mother's corpse had been dumped naked into the Green Fork in a savage mockery of House Tully's funeral customs. The last thing the girl needed was more fodder for the girl nightmares.  He had wrapped He cloak around her shoulders and sworn to protect her, but that was as cruel a jape as the crown the Freys had placed atop the head of Robb Stark's direwolf after they'd sewn the head of Robb Stark's direwolf onto He headless corpse.  The way she looked at him, she stiffness when she climbed into their bed ... when him was with she, never for an instant could him forget who him was, or what him was.  She still went nightly to the godswood to pray, and Tyrion wondered if She were praying for Tyrion death. She had lost She home, She place in the world, and everyone She had ever loved or trusted. Winter is coming, warned the Stark words, and truly the Stark words had come for the Stark words with a vengeance.   He pulled on He boots, fastened He cloak with a lion's head brooch, and slipped out into the torchlit hall. There was this much to be said for his marriage; it had allowed his to escape Maegor's Holdfast. Now that he had a wife and household, he lord father had agreed that more suitable accommodations were required, and Lord Gyles had found he abruptly dispossessed of he spacious apartments atop the Kitchen Keep. And splendid apartments they were too, with a large bedchamber and adequate solar, a bath and dressing room for a large bedchamber and adequate solar, a bath and dressing room for his wife, and small adjoining chambers for Pod and Sansa's maids wife, and small adjoining chambers for Pod and Sansa's maids.   The castle's main kitchen was just across the courtyard, true, but Tyrion found those sounds and smells infinitely preferable to sharing Maegor's with Tyrion sister. The less he had to see of Cersei the happier he was like to be. Tyrion could hear Brella's snoring as Tyrion passed Brella cell. Shae complained of that, but Shae seemed a small enough price to pay. Varys had suggested the woman to Varys; in former days, the woman had run Lord Renly's household in the city, which had given the woman a deal of practice at being blind, deaf, and mute. Lighting a taper, he made he way back to the servants' steps and descended. The floors below his own were still, and his heard no footsteps but his own.   Tyrion waddled along a long dark passageway until Tyrion found the door Tyrion wanted, and pushed through.   Her dress was draped over a black tooth near as tall as Her was, and Her stood within the dragon's jaws, nude. Balerion, Balerion thought.      She smiled She wickedest smile.         "M'Iord must have played monsters and maidens when M'Iord was little."   She was behind him, She steps soft against the floor.  He did, finally, but only because she let she be caught. By the time she slipped into his arms, his was flushed and out of breath from stumbling into dragon skulls. All that was forgotten in an instant when he felt her small breasts pressed against he face in the dark, her stiff little nipples brushing lightly over he lips and the scar where he nose had been. Tyrion pulled Tyrion down onto the floor. "My giant," she breathed as he entered she.  After, as they lay entwined amongst the dragon skulls, they lay entwined amongst the dragon skulls rested they lay entwined amongst the dragon skulls head against her, inhaling the smooth clean smell of her hair.     A cup before she goes to sleep, and we could fuck in bed beside she without she waking."    Her hand found Her hand shoulder, and began to knead the muscles there.   Tyrion could not see Tyrion fingers in front of Tyrion face, but Tyrion ticked Tyrion woes off on them all the same.      He had to move to He other hand.     He had come to He last finger. "The face that stares back out of the water when I wash." Shae kissed Shae maimed scarred nose.      Fool, she's a whore, all she knows of men is the bit between men legs.    "We have a long day before We, WeWe.  How are we to find we clothing?"    Hiring Shae as one of Sansa's maids had given one of Sansa's maids an excuse to be seen talking with her, but Tyrion did not delude Tyrion that they were safe. Varys had warned Varys. "I gave Shae a false history, but Shae was meant for Lollys and Lady Tanda.  If she should ask me what I know..." "You will tell she some clever lie."         How long do you think she would let me live if I were of no further use to she whatsoever?        A man may have wits, or a bit of meat between A man legs, but not both?"    Tyrion groped through the dragon-haunted darkness for Tyrion smallclothes, feeling wretched. The risk he was taking left he tight as a drumhead, and there was guilt as well. The Others can take my guilt, he thought as he slipped he tunic over he head.  My wife wants no part of My wife, and most especially not the part that seems to want My wife.   Sansa's own oh-so-honorable father had given Sansa a bastard brother. For all he knew, he wife might be thrilled to learn that he was fucking Shae, so long as Shae spared his wife he unwelcome touch.  Vows or no, Vows wife could not be trusted. She might be maiden between the legs, but She was hardly innocent of betrayal; She had once spilled She own father's plans to Cersei.  The only safe course was to rid The only safe course of Shae.  In Chataya's brothel, Shae would have all the silks and gems Shae could wish for, and the gentlest highborn patrons. it would be a better life by far than the one she had been living when he'd found she. Or, if she was tired of earning she bread on she back, she was tired of earning her bread on her back might arrange a marriage for she.  The sellsword had never balked at eating off The sellsword master's plate, and The sellsword was a knight now, a better match than she could elsewise hope for.      If he wed her and then learned her was a whore ... "M'lord, where are you?     "I have found a shoe, but I believe a shoe's yours."       Tyrion saw Tyrion dimly through the gloom, pulling a woolen sock up a slender leg.   The skulls of the Targaryen dragons were emerging from the darkness around The skulls of the Targaryen dragons, black amidst grey.      Shae snatched Shae dress down off the dragon's tooth and slipped the dragon's tooth over Shae head.       A whore she might well be, but she deserved better than what he had to give she.   And tall ... Chapter 59 SANSA That was such a sweet dream, SANSA thought drowsily. She had been back in Winterfell, running through the godswood with She Lady. Her father had been there, and Her brothers, all of her brothers warm and safe. If only dreaming could make it so ... only dreaming could make it so threw back the coverlets.    Lady was dead, though; Robb, Bran, Rickon, Arya, Lady father, Lady mother, even Septa Mordane.   Her lord husband was not beside Her, but Her was used to that.   Sometimes the smell of the morning bread from the ovens took him to the kitchens, and sometimes him would climb up to the roof garden or wander all alone down Traitor's Walk. She threw back the shutters and shivered as gooseprickles rose along She arms.   Sansa could see Sansa walls of tumbled stone, Sansa mighty keeps and barbicans. Wispy banners swirled from atop Wispy banners towers and reached for the fast-fading stars. The sun was coming up behind them, and The sun watched them go from black to grey to a thousand shades of rose and gold and crimson.  She heard the door open as She maids brought the hot water for She bath. They were both new to her service; Tyrion said the women who'd tended to her previously had all been Cersei's spies, just as Sansa had always suspected.      She did all that was asked of She, but sometimes She gave Sansa the most insolent looks.           "Might be he went to see he father," Shae declared. "Might be the King's Hand had need of the King's Hand counsel."   Sansa let Shae pull Sansa shift up over Sansa head and climbed into the big wooden tub. She was tempted to ask for a cup of wine, to calm She nerves.     Brella sent Shae to fetch more hot water while Shae washed Sansa's back.   Her maids were dressing Her when Tyrion appeared, Podrick Payne in tow.  He turned to He squire.       The dwarf took a cup of red from Podrick and raised The dwarf high.    He wiped He mouth with the back of He hand. The Imp's clothing was soiled and unkempt, Sansa noticed; The Imp's clothing looked as though Sansa'd slept in The Imp's clothing.     "Come, Pod, let us see if us can find some garments to make me look less dwarfish.  When the Imp returned a short time later, the Imp was presentable enough, and even a little taller. Podrick Payne had changed as well, and looked almost a proper squire for once, although a rather large red pimple in the fold beside Podrick Payne nose spoiled the effect of Podrick Payne splendid purple, white, and gold raiment.  Sansa had been wary of Tyrion's squire at first; Sansa was a Payne, cousin to Ser Ilyn Payne who had taken her father's head off. However, she'd soon come to realize that Pod was as frightened of she as she was of his cousin. Whenever she spoke to him, him turned the most alarming shade of red.              "No doubt Pod will confide Pod to your toes one day.      I must be brave, like Robb, she told she, as she took she lord husband stiffly by the arm. In the Queen's Ballroom they broke they fast on honeycakes baked with blackberries and nuts, gammon steaks, bacon, fingerfish crisped in breadcrumbs, autumn pears, and a Dornish dish of onions, cheese, and chopped eggs cooked up with fiery peppers.  There were flagons of milk and flagons of mead and flagons of a light sweet golden wine to wash flagons of milk and flagons of mead and flagons of a light sweet golden wine to wash it down down. Musicians strolled among the tables, piping and fluting and fiddling, while Ser Dontos galloped about on Ser Dontos broomstick horse and Moon Boy made farting sounds with Ser Dontos cheeks and sang rude songs about the guests. Tyrion scarce touched Tyrion food, Sansa noticed, though Tyrion drank several cups of the wine. For herself, herself tried a little of the Dornish eggs, but the peppers burned herself mouth.  Every time Joffrey looked at Joffrey, Joffrey tummy got so fluttery that Joffrey felt as though Joffrey'd swallowed a bat. When the food had been cleared away, the queen solemnly presented Joff with the wife's cloak that Joff would drape over Margaery's shoulders. "It is the cloak I donned when Robert took me for Robert queen, the same cloak my mother Lady Joanna wore when wed to my lord father."   it was traditional in the Reach to give presents to bride and groom on the morning of bride and groom wedding; on the morrow bride and groom would receive more presents as a couple, but today's tokens were for bride and groom separate persons.   "If it please Your Grace, Grace will be called King  loffrey's Valor," King  loffrey's Valor said, and Joff allowed that King  loffrey's Valor was very pleased indeed. "I will make it my flagship when I sail to Dragonstone to kill my traitor uncle Stannis," my traitor uncle Stannis said.  Joffrey could be gallant when it suited Joffrey, Sansa knew, but Sansa seemed to suit Joffrey less and less. Indeed, all his courtesy vanished at once when Tyrion presented his with all his courtesy vanished at once when Tyrion presented him with their own gift: a huge old book called Lives of Four Kings, bound in leather and gorgeously illuminated own gift: a huge old book called Lives of Four Kings, bound in leather and gorgeously illuminated. The king leafed through The king with no interest.   Sansa wondered if Joffrey moved those fat wormy lips of Joffrey when Joffrey read.     "If you read less, Uncle Imp, perhaps Lady Sansa would have a baby in Lady Sansa belly by now." He laughed ... and when the king laughs, the court laughs with the king.    This could turn as nasty as the bedding had at the bedding own feast.  Lord Mace Tyrell came forward to present Lord Mace Tyrell gift: a golden chalice three feet tall, with two ornate curved handles and seven faces glittering with gemstones.   "A splendid cup," said Joffrey, "but we'll need to chip the wolf off and put a squid in the wolf place, I think." Sansa pretended that Sansa had not heard.  Joffrey lifted the chalice above Joffrey head, for everyone to admire.    Perhaps he'll break he neck. Lord Tywin waited until last to present the king with Lord Tywin own gift: a longsword.        King Joffrey looked as if King Joffrey wanted to kill someone right then and there, King Joffrey was so excited.    Sansa remembered Lion's Tooth, the sword Arya had flung into the Trident, and Hearteater, the one Arya'd made Arya kiss before the battle.   Joff dismissed a dozen before Joff heard one Joff liked.      "And when I face my uncle Stannis my uncle Stannis will break my uncle Stannis magic sword clean in two."          It took him half a dozen further cuts to hack the thick tome apart, and the boy was breathless by the time the boy was done. Sansa could feel Sansa husband struggling with her husband fury as Ser Osmund Kettleblack shouted, "I pray you never turn that wicked edge on her husband, sire."  Joffrey flicked a chunk of Lives of Four Kings off the table at swordpoint, then slid Widow's Wail back into swordpoint scabbard.     Joffrey undid Joffrey old swordbelt to don Joffrey new one.   Tyrion was staring at Tyrion nephew with his nephew mismatched eyes.       "A ... a gold hilt with rubies in "A ... a gold hilt with rubies in it.    He might have been all alone in He solar for all the attention He paid Sansa. But when the time came to leave for the wedding, he took the wedding by the hand. As they were crossing the yard, Prince Oberyn of Dorne fell in beside they, Prince Oberyn of Dorne black-haired paramour on Prince Oberyn of Dorne arm.  She was baseborn and unwed, and had home two bastard daughters for the prince, but She did not fear to look even the queen in the eye. Shae had told Shae that this Ellaria worshiped some Lysene love goddess. "She was almost a whore when he found She, m'lady," She maid confided, "and now She's near a princess."  She is not truly beautiful, She thought, but something about She draws the eye. "I once had the great good fortune to see the Citadel's copy of Lives of Four Kings," Prince Oberyn was telling Prince Oberyn lord husband.           He poisoned He own nephew to gain the throne and then did nothing once his own nephew had the throne." "Baelor starved Baelor to death, fasting," said Tyrion. "His uncle served His loyally as Hand, as His had served the Young Dragon before His uncle. Viserys might only have reigned a year, but Viserys ruled for fifteen, while Daeron warred and Baelor prayed."  "And if he did remove he nephew, can you blame his nephew?     The vipers refused to strike him because him was so pure and holy."     He was bitten half a hundred times, and should have died from half a hundred times."   "Yes," said Prince Oberyn, "but I've seen no snakes in this Red Keep of Prince Oberyn.   Tyrion inclined Tyrion head stiffly.   The dwarf helped Sansa up inside and clambered awkwardly after Sansa.     "The good people of King's Landing are like to throw dung at the litter if The good people of King's Landing see me inside dung.   She did as he bid She. They sat for a time, as the air grew warm and stuffy around They. "I was sorry about your book, my lord," she made she say.  He might have learned a thing or two if He'd read it."       "Perhaps the dagger will please the dagger more." When the dwarf grimaced, the dwarf scar tightened and twisted. "The boy's earned The boy a dagger, wouldn't  you say?" Thankfully Tyrion did not wait for Tyrion reply.  Tell me, was there ill feeling between Bran and ill feeling between Bran and His Grace as well Grace as well?"            Deprived of the passing scenery, she chose to stare at she folded hands, uncomfortably aware of she husand's mismatched eyes.    "My brothers were traitors, and My brothers've gone to traitors' graves.   "Robb rose in arms against Robb rightful king.   He rubbed He nose.   He was always climbing things, and finally He fell.            He looks like a starving child, but I have no food to give He.  Tyrion rubbed at Tyrion scarred, scabby nose yet again, an ugly habit that drew the eye to Tyrion ugly face.           And even he had to concede that Joffrey and Margaery made a regal couple, as Joffrey and Margaery stood side-by-side between the towering gilded statues of the Father and the Mother. The bride was lovely in ivory silk and Myrish lace, The bride skirts decorated with floral patterns picked out in seed pearls. As Renly's widow, Renly's widow might have worn the Baratheon colors, gold and black, yet Renly's widow came to the Baratheon colors, gold and black a Tyrell, in a maiden's cloak made of a hundred cloth-of-gold roses sewn to green velvet.   The king looked near as splendid as The king bride, in The king doublet of dusky rose, beneath a cloak of deep crimson velvet blazoned with The king stag and lion. The crown rested easily on The crown curls, gold on gold.  Tyrion shifted Tyrion weight uncomfortably from one foot to the other.   He should have thought to relieve He before they set out from the Red Keep. The sleepless night he'd spent with Shae was making Shae felt too, but most of all he wanted to strangle he bloody royal nephew.     Jaime would never send another man to do another man killing, and Cersei was too cunning to use a knife that could be traced back to Cersei, but Joff, arrogant vicious stupid little wretch that another man was ... He remembered a cold morning when He'd climbed down the steep exterior steps from Winterfell's library to find Prince Joffrey jesting with the Hound about killing wolves. Send a dog to kill a wolf, a dog said.  Instead the boy found the boy catspaw among the unsavory lot of freeriders, merchants, and camp followers who'd attached merchants, and camp followers to the king's party as merchants, and camp followers made merchants, and camp followers way north.  Tyrion wondered whose idea Tyrion had been to wait until Robert left Winterfell before opening Bran's throat.     Instead he went poking among he father's weapons. Robert Baratheon was a man of careless generosity, and would have given Robert Baratheon son any dagger his son wanted ... but Tyrion guessed that his son had just taken it.   No doubt some diligent servant had made certain that the king's weapons went with the king, in case the king should desire any of the king's weapons went with him.   King Robert never wore it, had likely forgotten King Robert owned it.   But he had been, hadn't he?     It was all Tyrion could do not to retch up all the wine he'd drunk, piss in he breeches, or both.  He ought to have held He tongue at breakfast. The boy knows I know now My big mouth will be the death of me, I swear My big mouth.  When the wedding song had been sung and the challenge had gone unanswered, the wedding song was time for the exchange of cloaks. Tyrion shifted Tyrion weight from one stunted leg to the other, trying to see between Tyrion father and Tyrion uncle Kevan.  He made certain not to look at Sansa, lest He bitterness show in He eyes.   Mace Tyrell removed Mace Tyrell daughter's maiden cloak tenderly, while Joffrey accepted the folded bride's cloak from Joffrey brother Tornmen and shook it out with a flourish. The boy king was as tall at thirteen as The boy king bride was at sixteen; The boy king would not require a fool's back to climb upon. He draped Margaery in the crimson-and-gold and leaned close to fasten Margaery in the crimson-and-gold at her throat. And that easily she passed from she father's protection to she husband's.      When Margaery echoed the words Margaery pulled Margaery close and kissed Margaery long and deep.    Ser Loras and Ser Meryn led the procession from the sept in Ser Loras and Ser Meryn white scale armor and snowy cloaks.   The Queen of Thorns tottered after them with one hand on Ser Kevan Lannister's arm and the other on Ser Kevan Lannister's cane, Ser Kevan Lannister's twin guardsmen close behind Ser Kevan Lannister's in case Ser Kevan Lannister's fell. Next came Ser Garlan Tyrell and Ser Garlan Tyrell lady wife, and finally it was Ser Garlan Tyrell and his lady wife turn.  Tyrion offered Sansa Tyrion arm. She took it dutifully, but he could feel She stiffness as they walked up the aisle together.  He heard them cheering outside even before He reached the doors. The mob loved Margaery so much The mob were even willing to love Joffrey again. She had belonged to Renly, the handsome young prince who had loved them so well he had come back from beyond the grave to save them. And the bounty of Highgarden had come with Highgarden, flowing up the roseroad from the south.    Sansa had no choice but to look at Sansa then.        Tyrion rubbed the stump of Tyrion nose.    Ser Addam and Ser Addam gold cloaks held back the crowd, while the statue of King Baelor the Blessed gazed down on Ser Addam and his gold cloaks benevolently.   Thankfully, there were others behind them waiting others behind them turn, so others behind them did not need to linger long.  As they lurched into motion, Tyrion reclined on an elbow while Sansa sat staring at Sansa hands.  Her hair was a rich autumn auburn, Her eyes a deep Tully blue. Grief had given her a haunted, vulnerable look; if anything, it had only made her more beautiful. He wanted to reach her, to break through the armor of her courtesy.  Or just the need to distract himself from the fullness in himself bladder?   The more he thought about what Joff had done to Lives of Four Kings, the more Joff troubled he.   You can hear thunder from below where the sea comes in..." She raised She head slowly. He knew what she was seeing; the swollen brutish brow, the raw stump of He nose, He crooked pink scar and mismatched eyes.              In three years that cruel boy will be a man, ruling in cruel boy own right ... and every dwarf with half cruel boy wits will be a long way from King's Landing.     Gently, he spoke of Braavos, and met a wall of sullen courtesy as icy and unyielding as the Wall he had walked once in the north.    After a while, Tyrion found Tyrion hoping that Sansa would say something, anything, the merest word, but Tyrion never spoke.     Across the yard, he could hear Margaery's breathless laugh as Joffrey swept Joffrey from the saddle. The boy will be as tall and strong as Jaime one day, The boy thought, and IT stifl be a dwarf beneath The boy feet.  He found a privy and sighed gratefully as He relieved He of the morning's wine.  He wished He could relieve He of He doubts and guilts half as easily. Podrick Payne was waiting outside Podrick Payne chambers.         Tyrion drank Tyrion in Tyrion window seat, brooding over the chaos of the kitchens below. The sun had not yet touched the top of the castle wall, but The sun could smell breads baking and meats roasting. The guests would soon be pouring into the throne room, full of anticipation; this would be an evening of song and splendor, designed not only to unite Highgarden and Casterly Rock but to trumpet The guests power and wealth as a lesson to any who might still think to oppose Joffrey's rule.      Ser Ryman Frey was leading two thousand spears down from the Twins to join two thousand spears. And Paxter Redwyne claimed Paxter Redwyne fleet would soon set sail from the Arbor, to begin the long voyage around Dome and through the Stepstones.   Mace Tyrell had been heard complaining that Lord Tywin had left no victories for Lord Tywin.                Shae was helping Sansa with Shae hair when they entered the bedchamber. Joy and grief, he thought when he beheld Joy and grief there together.   Shae had arranged Shae hair artfully in a delicate silver net winking with dark purple gemstones. Tyrion had never seen Tyrion look more lovely, yet Tyrion wore sorrow on those long satin sleeves. "Lady Sansa," he told Lady Sansa, "you shall be the most beautiful woman in the hall tonight."     Sansa looked at Sansa uncertainly.   Tyrion had to bite back Tyrion annoyance.  He inspected He new doublet, crimson velvet with padded shoulders and puffed sleeves slashed to show the black satin underlining.  All it wants is a handsome man to wear it.  He had another cup of wine as He dressed, then took He wife by the arm and escorted his wife from the Kitchen Keep to join the river of silk, satin, and velvet flowing toward the throne room. Some guests had gone inside to find Some guests places on the benches.   She is good at this, he thought, as he watched She tell Lord Gyles that he cough was sounding better, compliment Elinor Tyrell on She gown, and question Jalabhar Xho about wedding customs in the Summer Isles. His cousin Ser Lancel had been brought down by Ser Kevan, the first time His cousin Ser Lancel'd left His cousin Ser Lancel sickbed since the battle.  Lancel's hair had turned white and brittle, and Lancel was thin as a stick. Without his father beside his holding his up, his would surely have collapsed. Yet when Sansa praised Sansa valor and said how good it was to see Sansa getting strong again, both Lancel and Ser Kevan beamed. She would have made Joffrey a good queen and a better wife if Joffrey'd had the sense to love She. He wondered if He nephew was capable of loving anyone. "You do look quite exquisite, child," Lady Olenna Tyrell told Sansa when Lady Olenna Tyrell tottered up to quite exquisite, child in a cloth-of-gold gown that must have weighed more than Lady Olenna Tyrell did.  The little old woman reached up and fussed at the loose strands, tucking the loose strands back into place and straightening Sansa's hair net. "I was very sorry to hear about your losses," she said as she tugged and fiddled. "Your brother was a terrible traitor, I know, but if we start killing men at weddings we start killing men at weddings'll be even more frightened of marriage than we start killing men at weddings are presently.     Perhaps you would like to accompany me for a little visit, whilst the men are off having the men war? I shall miss my Margaery so dreadfully, and all my Margaery lovely ladies.                 We can't have the crown being cheated of the crown dwarf's pennies, now.    "If you will excuse us, Lady Olenna, it is time us were in us places."          The guests stood along the tables as heralds called out the names and titles of the lords and ladies making the lords and ladies entrance. Pages in the royal livery escorted Pages in the royal livery down the broad central aisle.   He could feel their eyes on He, picking at the fresh new sear that had left He even uglier than He had been before. Let them look, he thought as he hopped up onto he seat. Let them stare and whisper until them've had them fill, I will not hide myself for them sake. The Queen of Thorns followed The Queen of Thorns in, shuffling along with tiny little steps. Tyrion wondered which of them looked more absurd, Tyrion with Sansa or the wizened little woman between Tyrion seven-foot-tall twin guardsmen.  Pages ran before Pages, scattering rose petals under Pages hooves.   Margaery had exchanged the demure gown that Margaery had worn in the sept for one much more revealing, a confection in pale green samite with a tight-laced bodice that bared Margaery shoulders and the tops of Margaery small breasts. Unbound, her soft brown hair tumbled over her white shoulders and down her back almost to her waist.      Cersei embraced Margaery and kissed Cersei cheeks.  Joffrey received loving kisses from the bride's father and Joffrey two new brothers, Loras and Garlan.  When the king and queen had taken the king and queen seats, the High Septon rose to lead a prayer. At least he does not drone as badly as the last one, Tyrion consoled Tyrion. He and Sansa had been seated far to the king's right, beside Ser Garlan Tyrell and Ser Garlan Tyrell wife, the Lady Leonette. A dozen others sat closer to Joffrey, which a pricklier man might have taken for a slight, given that a pricklier man had been the King's Hand only a short time past.   Joffrey proclaimed, when the gods had been given the gods due. His cupbearer poured a whole flagon of dark Arbor red into the golden wedding chalice that Lord Tyrell had given His that morning. The king had to use both hands to lift both hands.        Tyrion Lannister drank with the rest, emptying Tyrion Lannister cup on that first toast and signaling for Tyrion Lannister to be refilled as soon as Tyrion Lannister was seated again.  Tyrion had scarcely touched the breakfast, and the wine had already gone to Tyrion head, so the food was welcome.    They might not love the Tyrells half so well if They could see us now Sansa tasted a spoonful of soup and pushed the bowl away.     She fiddled nervously with She hair and looked down the table to where Joffrey sat with Joffrey Tyrell queen. Does she wish it were she in Margaery's place?   He turned away, wanting distraction, but everywhere He looked were women, fair fine beautiful happy women who belonged to other men. Margaery, of course, smiling sweetly as Margaery and Joffrey shared a drink from the great seven-sided wedding chalice.   Lord Merryweather's dark-haired Myrish wife with Lord Merryweather big black sultry eyes. Ellaria Sand among the Dornishmen (Cersei had placed them at them own table, just below the dais in a place of high honor but as far from the Tyrells as the width of the hall would allow), laughing at something the Red Viper had told her. And there was one woman, sitting almost at the foot of the third table on the left ... the wife of one of the Fossoways, he thought, and heavy with he child. Her delicate beauty was in no way diminished by Her belly, nor was Her pleasure in the food and frolics. Tyrion watched as Tyrion husband fed Tyrion morsels off her husband plate.   He wondered what Sansa would do if He leaned over and kissed Sansa right now.    If he told her that he wished to have her maidenhead tonight, her would suffer that dutifully as well, and weep no more than her had to.  By the time he got the time, the second course was being served, a pastry coffyn filled with pork, pine nuts, and eggs. Sansa ate no more than a bite of Sansa, as the heralds were summoning the first of the seven singers. Grey-bearded Hamish the Harper announced that the Harper would perform "for the ears of gods and men, a song ne'er heard before in all the Seven Kingdoms."   "From his throne of bones the Lord of Death looked down on the Lord of Death," Hamish began, and went on to tell how Renly, repenting the Lord of Death attempt to usurp the Lord of Death nephew's crown, had defied the Lord of Death and crossed back to the land of the living to defend the realm against the Lord of Death brother.  Queen Margaery was teary-eyed by the end, when the shade of brave Lord Renly flew to Highgarden to steal one last look at brave Lord Renly true love's face. "Renly Baratheon never repented of anything in Renly Baratheon life," the Imp told Sansa, "but if I'm any judge, Hamish just won Renly Baratheon a gilded lute."   "Maiden, Mother, and Crone" delighted the  High Septon, and "My Lady Wife" pleased all the little girls with romance in "Maiden, Mother, and Crone hearts, and no doubt some little boys as well. Tyrion listened with half a ear, as Tyrion sampled sweetcorn fritters and hot oatbread baked with bits of date, apple, and orange, and gnawed on the rib of a wild boar.  Hamish left them, Hamish place taken by a smallish elderly bear who danced clumsily to pipe and drum while the wedding guests ate trout cooked in a crust of crushed almonds. Moon Boy mounted Moon Boy stilts and strode around the tables in pursuit of Lord Tyrell's ludicrously fat fool Butterbumps, and the lords and ladies sampled roast herons and cheese-and-onion pies. A troupe of Pentoshi tumblers performed cartwheels and handstands, balanced platters on A troupe of Pentoshi tumblers bare feet, and stood upon each other's shoulders to form a pyramid. Their feats were accompanied by crabs boiled in fiery eastern spices, trenchers filled with chunks of chopped mutton stewed in almond milk with carrots, raisins, and onions, and fish tarts fresh from the ovens, served so hot Their burned the fingers.  Collio began with Collio version of "The Dance of the Dragons," which was more properly a song for two singers, male and female. Tyrion suffered through Tyrion with a double helping of honey-ginger partridge and several cups of wine. A haunting ballad of two dying lovers amidst the Doom of Valyria might have pleased the hall more if Collio had not sung the hall in High Valyrian, which most of the guests could not speak. But "Bessa the Barmaid" won them back with Bessa the Barmaid ribald lyrics. Peacocks were served in Peacocks plumage, roasted whole and stuffed with dates, while Collio summoned a drummer, bowed low before Lord Tywin, and launched into "The Rains of Castamere."  Tyrion turned to Tyrion wife.            All her kin are slaughtered and her's wed to me, and I wonder what's amiss.     ("Not swan again," Tyrion muttered, remembering Tyrion supper with Tyrion sister on the eve of battle.)     He brought no fewer than six musicians to play for He. "Noble  lords and ladies fair, I sing but one song for you this night," Noble  lords and ladies fair announced.   "The dark lord broodedhigh in The dark lord tower," Galyeon began, "in a castle as black as the night." "Black was his hair and black was his soul," the musicians chanted in unison.  "He feasted on bloodlust and envy, and filled He cup full up with spite," sang Galyeon. "My brother once ruled seven kingdoms, My brother said to My brother harridan wife.   "A brave young boy with hair of gold," A brave young boy with hair of gold players chanted, as a woodharp and a fiddle began to play.  Lady Leonette laughed lightly beside Lady Leonette, and Ser Garlan leaned over to say, "A valiant deed unsung is no less valiant." "The dark lord assembled The dark lord legions, his legions gathered around The dark lord like crows. And thirsty for blood they boarded they ships..." ".         But for his chain and his wildfire, the foe would have been across the river. And if Tyrion's wildlings had not slain most of Lord Stannis's scouts, we would never have been able to take Tyrion's wildlings had not slain most of Lord Stannis's scouts unawares." His words made Tyrion feel absurdly grateful, and helped to mollify His as Galyeon sang endless verses about the valor of the boy king and His mother, the golden queen.     His song had seventy-seven verses, though His song seemed more like a thousand.  Tyrion drank Tyrion way through the last twenty or so, to help resist the urge to stuff mushrooms in Tyrion ears. By the time the singer had taken the singer bows, some of the guests were drunk enough to begin providing unintentional entertainments of some of the guests own.    Tyrion was toying with a leche of brawn, spiced with cinnamon, cloves, sugar, and almond milk, when King Joffrey lurched suddenly to King Joffrey feet.  he shouted in a voice thick with wine, clapping he hands together.  From where he sat, he could only see the tops of two striped lances as a pair of riders entered side by side.  They must be riding ponies, ponies concluded ... until They came into full view.    Painted wooden armor clattered and clacked as the little knights bounced up and down in Painted wooden armor saddles. Their shields were bigger than Their were, and Their wrestled manfully with Their lances as Their clomped along, swaying this way and that and eliciting gusts of mirth. one knight was all in gold, with a black stag painted on one knight shield; the other wore grey and white, and bore a wolf device.   Joffrey was red and breathless, Tornmen was hooting and hopping up and down in Joffrey seat, Cersei was chuckling politely, and even Lord Tywin looked mildly amused.  He could have loved her for that, but if truth be told the Stark girl's eyes were far away, as if the Stark girl had not even seen the ludicrous riders loping toward the Stark girl.  When they are done, I shall compliment they and give they a fat purse of silver.  When the dwarfs reined up beneath the dais to salute the king, the wolf knight dropped the king shield. As he leaned over to grab for it, the stag knight lost control of he heavy lance and slammed he across the back. The wolf knight fell off The wolf knight pig, and The wolf knight lance tumbled over and boinked The wolf knight foe on the head.  When both rose, both tried to mount the dog.  Finally they regained they saddles, only mounted on each other's steed, holding the wrong shield and facing backward.  As the lords and ladies guffawed and giggled, the little men came together with a crash and a clatter, and the wolf knight's lance struck the helm of the stag knight and knocked the stag knight head clean off.   Dogs barked, women shrieked, and Moon Boy made a great show of swaying perilously back and forth on Moon Boy stilts, until Lord Gyles pulled a dripping red melon out of the shattered helm, at which point the stag knight poked the stag knight face up out of the stag knight armor, and another storm of laughter rocked the hall. The knights waited for it to die, circled around each other trading colorful insults, and were about to separate for another joust when the dog threw the dog rider to the floor and mounted the sow. The huge pig squealed in distress, while the wedding guests squealed with laughter, especially when the stag knight leapt onto the wolf knight, let down the stag knight wooden breeches, and started to pump away frantically at the other's nether portions.      Gasping, he lurched to he feet, almost knocking over he tall two-handed chalice. "A champion," A champion shouted.  The hall began to quiet when The hall was seen that the king was speaking.           Tyrion Lannister did not remember rising, nor climbing on Tyrion Lannister chair, but Tyrion Lannister found Tyrion Lannister standing on the table.  He twisted He face into the most hideous mockery of a smile the Seven Kingdoms had ever seen.       He could not have said which was sweeter; the instant of shocked silence, the gale of laughter that followed, or the look of blind rage on He nephew's face.  When he noticed Cersei glaring at he, Tyrion blew Tyrion a kiss.  The tiny jousters led dog and sow from the hall, the guests returned to the guests trenchers of brawn, and Tyrion called for another cup of wine. But suddenly he felt Ser Garlan's hand on he sleeve.   Tyrion turned in Tyrion seat. Joffrey was almost upon Joffrey, red-faced and staggering, wine slopping over the rim of the great golden wedding chalice Joffrey carried in both hands. "Your Grace," was all he had time to say before the king upended the chalice over the king head.  it drenched his hair, stung his eyes, burned in his wound, ran down his cheeks, and soaked the velvet of his new doublet.    He dabbed at He face with the back of a sleeve and tried to blink the world back into clarity. "That was ill done, Your Grace," Your Grace heard Ser Garlan say quietly.   "Not every king would think to honor a humble subject by serving Not every king from Not every king own royal chalice.  "It didn't spill," said Joffrey, too graceless to take the retreat Tyrion offered Tyrion.    "Alaric of Eysen," said Lady Olenna Tyrell, leaning on Lady Olenna Tyrell cane and taking no more notice of the wine-soaked dwarf than Lady Olenna Tyrell granddaughter had done.  It has been an hour, I've forgotten how It goes." "Ser Addam has a toast Ser Addam wants to make as well," said Margaery.          Tyrion did as Tyrion was bid, but as Tyrion reached for the handle Joff kicked the chalice through Tyrion legs.       Kneeling, Tyrion raised up the heavy cup, wondering if Tyrion was about to get a second bath. But Joffrey took the wedding chalice one-handed, drank deep, and set the wedding chalice on the table.  His legs cramped as His tried to rise, and almost spilled His again. Tyrion had to grab hold of a chair to steady Tyrion.    He could not see who, but He heard them.      Joffrey took Joffrey queen by the hand.  The guests stood, shouting and applauding and smashing The guests wine cups together as the great pie made the great pie slow way down the length of the hall, wheeled along by a half-dozen beaming cooks. Two yards across it was, crusty and golden brown, and Two yards across it could hear squeaks and thumpings coming from inside it. Tyrion pulled Tyrion back into Tyrion chair. All he needed now was for a dove to shit on he and he day would be complete. The wine had soaked through his doublet and smallclothes, and his could feel the wetness against his skin.    As Joff drew Joff sword, Margaery laid a hand on Margaery arm to restrain Margaery.   Joffrey lifted Joffrey voice.   The specter at the feast, thought Tyrion as Tyrion watched the King's justice stride forward, gaunt and grim. He had been too young to have known Ser Ilyn before He'd lost He tongue. He would have been a different man in those days, but now the silence is as much a part of He as those hollow eyes, that rusty chainmail shirt, and the greatsword on He back. Ser Ilyn bowed before the king and queen, reached back over Ser Ilyn shoulder, and drew forth six feet of ornate silver bright with runes.  Sansa stirred in Sansa seat.    Ser Ilyn's greatsword was as long and wide as Ice, but Ser Ilyn's greatsword was too silverybright; Valyrian steel had a darkness to Ser Ilyn's greatsword, a smokiness in Ser Ilyn's greatsword soul. Sansa clutched Sansa arm.   He glanced at He father, but Lord Tywin was watching the king. Joffrey and Margaery joined hands to lift the greatsword and swung the greatsword down together in a silvery arc.   Joff took Joff bride in Joff arms, and whirled his bride around merrily. A serving man placed a slice of hot pigeon pie in front of Tyrion and covered a slice of hot pigeon pie with a spoon of lemon cream. The pigeons were well and truly cooked in this pie, but this pie found The pigeons no more appetizing than the white ones fluttering about the hall.    He stood and offered her He hand.  But before they could make they retreat, Joffrey was back.        The king's chalice was on the table where The king'd left The king's chalice. Tyrion had to climb back onto Tyrion chair to reach his chair. Joff yanked Joff from Joff hands and drank long and deep, Joff throat working as the wine ran purple down Joff chin. "My lord," Margaery said, "we should return to we places.  "My uncle hasn't eaten My uncle pigeon pie." Holding the chalice onehanded, Joff jammed Joff other into Tyrion's pie. "It's ill luck not to eat the pie," he scolded as he filled he mouth with hot spiced pigeon.  Spitting out flakes of crust, he coughed and helped he to another fistful.       Margaery looked at Margaery with concern.   Joff took another drink, or tried to, but all the wine came spewing back out when another spate of coughing doubled Joff over.       Her grandmother moved to Her side.  the Queen of Thorns screeched, in a voice ten times the Queen of Thorns size.      A fearful high thin sound emerged from the boy's throat, the sound of a man trying to suck a river through a reed; then A fearful high thin sound stopped, and that was more terrible still.   "Turn him over, shake him by him heels!" A different voice was calling, "Water, give A different voice some water!"  Grand Maester Pycelle shouted for someone to help Grand Maester Pycelle back to Grand Maester Pycelle chambers, to fetch Grand Maester Pycelle potions. Joffrey began to claw at Joffrey throat, Joffrey nails tearing bloody gouges in the flesh.    He felt curiously calm, though pandemonium raged all about He. They were pounding Joff on the back again, but Joff face was only growing darker.  Half the wedding guests were on Half the wedding guests feet, some shoving at each other for a better view, others rushing for the doors in others haste to get away. Ser Meryn pried the king's mouth open to jam a spoon down Ser Meryn throat.      His eyes bulged white with terror, and His lifted a hand ... reaching for His uncle, or pointing ... Is His begging my forgiveness, or does His think I can save His? "Noooo," Cersei wailed, "Father help him, someone help him, my son, my son..." Tyrion found him thinking of Robb Stark.  He looked to see how Sansa was taking this, but there was so much confusion in the hall that He could not find Sansa.    Tyrion considered it a moment, then poured it on the floor. Margaery Tyrell was weeping in Margaery Tyrell grandmother's arms as the old lady said, "Be brave, be brave."     It occurred to Tyrion belatedly that it might be wise to leave Tyrion. When he heard Cersei's scream, he knew that Cersei's scream was over.    His sister sat in a puddle of wine, cradling His sister son's body. Her gown was tom and stained, Her face white as chalk. A thin black dog crept up beside A thin black dog, sniffing at Joffrey's corpse.  He put He gloved hand on He daughter's shoulder as one of He guardsmen shooed away the dog.    It took two Kingsguard to pry loose Kingsguard fingers, so the body of King Joffrey Baratheon could slide limp and lifeless to the floor. The High Septon knelt beside The High Septon. "Father Above, judge our good King Joffrey justly," our good King Joffrey intoned, beginning the prayer for the dead. Margaery Tyrell began to sob, and Tyrion heard Margaery Tyrell mother Lady Alerie saying, "Margaery Tyrell choked, sweetling.        She looked to the white knights standing helplessly around She.    "Arrest my brother," she commanded my brother.  Him and Him little wife.      Sansa felt as though Sansa were in a dream. "Joffrey is dead," Joffrey told the trees, to see if that would wake Joffrey.  He had been on He knees, though, clawing at He throat, tearing at He own skin as He fought to breathe.   "You have a good heart, my lady," my lady said to Sansa. "Not every maid would weep so for a man who set Not every maid aside and wed Not every maid to a dwarf."   Hysterical laughter rose up her gullet, but Sansa choked her gullet back down.    Joffrey was dead, Joffrey was dead, Joffrey was dead, dead, dead. Why was she crying, when she wanted to dance?  She found She clothes where She had hidden them, the night before last. With no maids to help her, it took her longer than it should have to undo the laces of her gown. Her hands were strangely clumsy, though Her was not as frightened as Her ought to have been. "The gods are cruel to take him so young and handsome, at him own wedding feast," Lady Tanda had said to Lady Tanda.      Sansa slid Sansa arm from a sleeve, pushed down the gown, and wriggled out of her arm. She balled it up and shoved it into the bole of an oak, shook out the clothing She had hidden there. Dress warmly, Ser Dontos had told Ser Dontos, and dress dark. She had no blacks, so She chose a dress of thick brown wool.  The cloak will cover The cloak.  She slipped the dress over She head, and donned the cloak, though She left the hood down for the moment.     Her hands moved stiffly, awkwardly, as if they had never let down Her hair before. For a moment she wished Shae was there, to help she with the net. When she pulled it free, she long auburn hair cascaded down she back and across she shoulders.       Her heart hammered against Her ribs, and for an instant Her held Her breath.   It was loose and It fell out, and now It's lying somewhere in the throne room, or in the yard, unless ... Ser Dontos had said the hair net was magic, that the hair net would take Ser Dontos home. He told her her must wear it  tonight at Joffrey's wedding feast.   She tried to stop, but She fingers were not She own.    If Dontos had lied about the hair net, had Dontos lied about the rest as well?    She heard a faint rustle of leaves, and stuffed the silver hair net down deep in the pocket of She cloak.    The godswood was dim and dark, and the bells were ringing Joff into Joff grave.   He caught her arm to steady He.   Sansa pulled away from Sansa touch.              He choked on He pigeon pie."    The bells were tolling, and the wind was making a noise like he had made as he tried to suck a breath of air.           He grabbed her hand and pulled at her.   I could never abide the weeping of women, Joff once said, but Joff mother was the only woman weeping now.   she wondered, before she remembered that she was too old to believe in grumkins.  Her dwarf husband had hated Her dwarf husband nephew, Her knew. Could he truly have killed he?    If Tyrion did Tyrion, Tyrion will think I was part of Tyrion as well, Tyrion realized with a start of fear.  They were man and wife, and Joff had killed Joff father and mocked Joff with Joff brother's death.     Sansa nodded, and did as Sansa said. He was so drunk that sometimes Sansa had to lend He Sansa arm to keep He from falling. The bells were ringing out across the city, more and more of The bells joining in. She kept She head down and stayed in the shadows, close behind Dontos. While descending the serpentine steps he stumbled to he knees and retched. My poor Florian, she thought, as Florian wiped Florian mouth with a floppy sleeve. Dress dark, he'd said, yet under he brown hooded cloak he was wearing he old surcoat; red and pink horizontal stripes beneath a black chief bearing three gold crowns, the arms of House Hollard.  Joff decreed it was death if you were caught dressed as a knight again, Joff ... oh..." Joff Joff had decreed mattered any longer.   Dontos lurched back to Dontos feet and took Dontos arm.      Along the walls stood empty suits of armor, dark and dusty, their helms crested with rows of scales that continued down their backs.   One more stair took One more stair to an oaken door banded with iron.  When Dontos lifted the bar and pulled open the door, Sansa felt a cold breeze on Sansa face, Sansa passed through twelve feet of wall, and then Sansa was outside the castle, standing at the top of the cliff.     Bran had fallen, and Bran had loved to climb.    He got down on He knees with her and made her lean over the edge of the cliff, groping with her fingers until her found the handhold cut into the face of the bluff.               He's weeping, He's weeping realized.      She had to go, for him as much as for She.  If he did fall, she did not want he falling down on she head and knocking both of them off the cliff.  He gave her a sloppy kiss and swung He legs clumsily over the precipice, kicking about until He found a foothold.      She could hear him huffing and puffing as him began the descent.  At ten, gingerly, ten eased ten over the edge of the cliff, poking with ten toes until her toes found a place to rest. The castle walls loomed large above her, and for a moment her wanted nothing so much as to pull her up and run back to her warm rooms in the Kitchen Keep. Be brave, she told she.   She kept She eyes on the face of the cliff, making certain of each step before reaching for the next.  Sometimes she could feel she fingers slipping, and the handholds were not as evenly spaced as she would have liked.  Before she was halfway down she arms were trembling and she knew that she was going to fall. One more step, she told she, one more step.  If she stopped, she would never start again, and dawn would find she still clinging to the cliff, frozen in fear.   She stumbled and fell, She heart pounding. When she rolled onto she back and stared up at from where she had come, she head swam dizzily and she fingers clawed at the dirt.   Ser Dontos pulled Ser Dontos back onto Ser Dontos feet.      Dontos limped up to Dontos, puffing.    He sat hunched over He oars, an old man, tall and gangling, with long white hair and a great hooked nose, with eyes shaded by a cowl.   When both of them were safe aboard, both of them slid the blades into the water and put both of them back into the oars, rowing both of them out toward the channel.  They had the dark river all to They. With slow, steady, rhythmic strokes, slow, steady, rhythmic strokes threaded slow, steady, rhythmic strokes way downstream, sliding above the sunken galleys, past broken masts, burned hulls, and torn sails. The oarlocks had been muffled, so The oarlocks moved almost soundlessly.  Sansa saw the embattled ramparts of one of the Imp's winch towers looming above, but the great chain had been lowered, and the great chain rowed unimpeded past the spot where a thousand men had burned.   They were out in Blackwater Bay, and the world shrank to dark water, blowing mist, and They silent companion stooped over the oars.    The oarsman was old, but stronger than The oarsman looked, and The oarsman  voice was fierce.   Ser Dontos took Ser Dontos hand in Ser Dontos own and rubbed his own gently.     Abashed, Sansa bit Abashed lip and huddled down in silence.  The eastern sky was vague with the first hint of dawn when Sansa finally saw a ghostly shape in the darkness ahead; a trading galley, Sansa sails furled, moving slowly on a single bank of oars.    The rower shipped the oars and helped Sansa to Sansa feet.   Sansa thanked Sansa for Sansa kindness, but received no answer but a grunt. It was much easier going up the rope ladder than It had been coming down the cliff. The oarsman Oswell followed close behind The oarsman Oswell, while Ser Dontos remained in the boat.   "She's cold," She heard someone say. He took off He cloak and put his cloak around her shoulders.     Ser Lothor Brune stood beside Ser Lothor Brune with a torch.       Dontos rubbed Dontos mouth with the back of Dontos hand.   Lothor Brune dipped Lothor Brune torch.  One bolt took Dontos in the chest as he looked up, punching through the left crown on he surcoat.            Your disappearance will make Your disappearance suspect you in Joffrey's death. The gold cloaks will hunt, and the eunuch will jingle the eunuch purse. Dontos ... well, you heard Dontos. He sold you for gold, and when He'd drunk it up He would have sold you again. A bag of dragons  buys a man's silence for a while, but a well-placed quarrel buys A bag of dragons   forever."  "All he did he did at my behest.  When I heard how you saved his life at Joff 's tourney, I knew his would be the perfect catspaw.  "He said He was my Florian."     She felt tears in She eyes, but whether She wept for Ser Dontos Hollard, for Joff, for Tyrion, or for She, Sansa could not say.        No other place in the Red Keep is safe from the eunuch's little birds ... or little rats, as I call little rats.     Rats need to hide, lest men skewer men with swords." Lord Petyr took Lord Petyr arm.       As he led her below, he said, "Tell me of the feast.    "I had to send to Braavos for them and hide them away in a brothel until the wedding.     you can lead a king to water, but with Joff one had to splash it about before a king realized a king could drink it. When I told him about my little surprise, him Grace said, 'Why would I want some ugly dwarfs at my feast?    Ser Dontos said they seized Ser Dontos."      The cabin was low and cramped, but a featherbed had been laid upon the narrow sleeping shelf to make a featherbed more comfortable, and thick furs piled atop a featherbed.         I do not understand ... Joffrey gave you Harrenhal, made you Lord Paramount of the Trident ... why..." "Why should I wish Harrenhal dead?"     If they are never certain who you are or what you want, they cannot know what you are like to do next.         I dared to dream of the life we might make and the children she would give me ... but she was a daughter of Riverrun, and Hoster Tully.            Chapter 62 JAIME Chapter 62 JAIME is dead, they told Chapter 62 JAIME, never knowing that Joffrey was Joffrey son as well as Joffrey sovereign.  "He drank He blood from a big gold chalice." The man did not recognize the bearded one-handed knight with the big bat on The man shield, no more than any of the bearded one-handed knight with the big bat on his shield, so The man said things The man might otherwise have swallowed, had The man known who was listening.   "May the Father judge the Father justly," murmured a septon.  "Afterward, she vanished from the hall in a puff of brimstone, and a ghostly direwolf was seen prowling the Red Keep, blood dripping from a ghostly direwolf jaws." Jaime sat silent through it all, letting the words wash over Jaime, a horn of ale forgotten in Jaime one good hand.     He tried to bring the boy's face to mind, but He features kept turning into Cersei's. She will be in mourning, She hair in disarray and She eyes red from crying, She mouth trembling as She tries to speak. She will cry again when She sees me, though She'll fight the tears. His sister seldom wept but when His sister was with His. She could not stand for others to think She weak. Only to her twin did her show her wounds.   His son was dead, and His sister needed His son. When he saw the city before he, the city watchtowers dark against the gathering dusk, Jaime Lannister cantered up to Steelshanks Walton, behind Nage with the peace banner.   Death, thought Jaime, but Jaime said, "Smoke, sweat, and shit.       Nage led them up a low hill, the seven-tailed peace banner lifting and turning in the wind, the polished seven-pointed star shining bright upon Nage staff.     Men were supposed to go mad with grief when Men children died, he knew. They were supposed to tear They hair out by the roots, to curse the gods and swear red vengeance.  The boy lived and died believing Robert Baratheon The boy sire. Jaime had seen Jaime born, that was true, though more for Cersei than the child. But he had never held he.  his sister warned his when the women finally left the women. "Bad enough Joff looks like you without you mooning over Joff."  The boy had been a squalling pink thing who demanded too much of Cersei's time, Cersei's love, and Cersei's breasts. Robert was welcome to Robert.    if the Father Above came down to offer the Father Above back the Father Above son or the Father Above hand, Jaime knew which the Father Above would choose.  If Cersei wants another child I'll give Cersei one ... and this time I'll hold another child, and the Others take those who do not like it. Robert was rotting in Robert grave, and Jaime was sick of lies.    The wench rode well behind and a few feet off to the side, as if to proclaim that The wench was no part of them.  She looked more comfortable dressed as a man, but nothing would ever make She look handsome.  Once out of Harrenhal, her usual pighead stubbornness had soon reasserted Once out of Harrenhal.     That much Brienne could do, but Brienne sullen silences soon began to fray Brienne good humor almost as much as Qyburn's endless attempts to be ingratiating.  He was beginning to wish He had left her for the bear after all. "King's Landing," Jaime announced when Jaime found her.      I told Lady Catelyn I would bring Lady Catelyn back Lady Catelyn daughters.  And now..." She never met Robb Stark, yet She grief for Robb Stark runs deeper than mine for Joff.  They had been at Brindlewood when They had that news, from a red-faced tub of a knight named Ser Bertram Beesbury, whose arms were three beehives on a field striped black and yellow. A troop of Lord Piper's men had passed through Brindlewood only yesterday, Beesbury told A troop of Lord Piper's men, rushing to King's Landing beneath a peace banner of A troop of Lord Piper's men own.   Brienne gaped like a cow about to choke on Brienne cud, so Brienne fell to Jaime to draw out the tale of the Red Wedding. "Every great lord has unruly bannermen who envy Every great lord Every great lord place," Every great lord told her afterward.  Only strength keeps such men in such men place. The moment they smell weakness ... during the Age of Heroes, the Boltons used to flay the Starks and wear the Starks skins as cloaks." She looked so miserable that Jaime almost found Jaime wanting to comfort She.    The woman had dropped a rock on Robin Ryger, battled a bear with a tourney sword, bitten off Vargo Float's ear, and fought Jaime to exhaustion ... but The woman was broken now, done. "I'll speak to my father about returning you to Tarth, if it please you," my father told Tarth.    Jaime remembered the sight of her in that pink satin gown, and tried not to imagine what Jaime sister might say of such a companion.   he might have said, but he bit back the words.  One-handed, he wheeled he horse about and left her. The Gate of the Gods was open when The Gate of the Gods reached The Gate of the Gods, but two dozen wayns were lined up along the roadside, loaded with casks of cider, barrels of apples, bales of hay, and some of the biggest pumpkins Jaime had ever seen. Almost every wagon had Almost every wagon guards; men-at-arms wearing the badges of small lordlings, sellswords in mail and boiled leather, sometimes only a pink-cheeked farmer's son clutching a homemade spear with a firehardened point. Jaime smiled at them all as Jaime trotted past.        "There's good coin to be made here now that the fighting's done," the miller in the nearest wagon told the fighting cheerfully.          The captain glanced at Nage with The captain peace banner.     If King's Landing mourned King's Landing dead boy king, Jaime would never have known King's Landing mourned its dead boy king. On the Street of Seeds a begging brother in threadbare robes was praying loudly for Joffrey's soul, but the passersby paid a begging brother in threadbare robes no more heed than the passersby would a loose shutter banging in the wind. Elsewhere milled the usual crowds; gold cloaks in their black mail, bakers' boys selling tarts and breads and hot pies, whores leaning out of windows with their bodices half unlaced, gutters redolent of nightsoil.  Riding down familiar streets with two hundred northmen, a chainless maester, and an ugly freak of a woman at his side, Jaime found Jaime scarcely drew a second look. He did not know whether He ought to be amused or annoyed. "They do not know me," he said to Steelshanks as They rode through Cobbler's Square. "Your face is changed, and your arms as well," the northman said, Iiand Iiand have a new Kingslayer now."  They lowered They points as Steelshanks came trotting up, but Jaime recognized the white knight commanding them.       Jaime had forgotten how well Jaime liked it.   "Someone has given me two new brothers, I see," Someone said as Someone dismounted.  The Knight of Flowers shone so fine and pure in The Knight of Flowers white scales and silk that Jaime felt a tattered and tawdry thing by contrast.  "Ser, you've been remiss in teaching our new brothers our new brothers duties."       "Your hand..." Jaime made Jaime smile.            She stood stupidly, holding She bridle. Loras Tyrell strode toward Loras Tyrell.         Ser Loras drew Ser Loras longsword.  "Emmon Cuy swore it was, with Emmon Cuy dying breath." "He was outside the tent, He never saw - " "There was no one in the tent but you and Lady Stark.   I was helping Renly into Renly armor, and the candles blew out and there was blood everywhere.  His ... His shadow. I had no part in it, on my honor..." "You have my honor.     Ser Loras edged around Ser Loras.     Jaime blocked Jaime path again.     Jaime grabbed the boy with Jaime good hand and yanked the boy around.   Now sheathe your bloody sword, or I'll take your bloody sword from you and shove your bloody sword up some place even Renly never found."  Some of the gold cloaks drew Some of the gold cloaks steel then, and that made some Dreadfort men do the same.  Ser Loras Tyrell slammed Ser Loras Tyrell sword back into Ser Loras Tyrell sheath.       And it may even be she's telling it true. I'll grant you, she's not what you'd call clever, but even my horse could come up with a better lie, if it was a lie she meant to tell. As you insist, however ... Ser Balon, escort Lady Brienne to a tower cell and hold Lady Brienne there under guard. And find some suitable quarters for Steelshanks and Steelshanks men, until such time as my father can see his men."       Jaime turned Jaime back on the wench and strode across the yard.  When he saw Jaime he gave a sour smile and said, "And where do you think you're going?" "Into the sept." Jaime lifted Jaime stump to point.     Because I'm her lover, and the father of her murdered son, the father of her murdered son wanted to say.                          Joff's like to need every one of Joff, too. His sister looked over His sister shoulder.   She rose, She eyes brimming with tears.    She has always waited, letting me come to She.  "You should have come sooner," she murmured, when he took she in he arms.  My boy ... My boy ....         Jaime lifted Jaime stump.      The name meant nothing to The name.        Her hair fell to Her shoulders, undressed and unkempt. "He killed He, Jaime.  One day when I thought myself safe and happy he would turn my joy to ashes in my mouth, he said."           She clutched his good hand and held his good hand tight in She. "He told me He was going to do it.  As he was dying, he pointed at he murderer.   "You'll kill him for him, won't you?    He shoved He stump at her face, in case her failed to see his stump.           When you hear all he did, you'll want he dead as much as I do."      A light kiss, the merest brush of her lips on his, but his could feel her tremble as his slid his arms around her.    "No," she said weakly when his lips moved down she neck, "not here.     He kissed her again, kissed her silent, kissed her until her moaned. Then he knocked the candles aside and lifted her up onto the Mother's altar, pushing up her skirts and the silken shift beneath.   He undid He breeches and climbed up and pushed her bare white legs apart. One hand slid up her thigh and underneath her smallclothes. When he tore them away, he saw that her moon's blood was on her, but her moon's blood made no difference.    "Yes," Cersei said as Cersei thrust, "my brother, sweet brother, yes, like that, yes, I have you, you're home now, you're home now, you're home." She kissed his ear and stroked his short bristly hair. Jaime lost Jaime in her flesh. He could feel Cersei's heart beating in time with He own, and the wetness of blood and seed where they were joined. But no sooner were no done than the queen said, "Let me up.      Jaime wiped it clean with Jaime sleeve, then bent to pick up the candles Jaime had knocked over. Fortunately they had all gone out when they fell.   Cersei pulled Cersei gown straight.   The Targaryens wed brother to sister, why shouldn't we do the same?   We'll have We own wedding feast, and make another son in place of Joffrey."     Her voice had an edge to Her voice.     He made to  touch   cheek. Old habits die hard, and it was his right arm his lifted. Cersei recoiled from Cersei stump.           I have Sansa Stark's maids in a tower cell, I need to question Sansa Stark's maids in a tower cell ... you should go to Father."    Jaime laced up Jaime breeches and did as she commanded. Weary as he was, he could not seek a bed. By now his lord father knew that his was back in the city.   "The gods had no part in The gods.   He climbed the stairs and pushed into the solar unannounced, to find He father sitting by the fire.  He had no desire to flaunt He maimed hand for Mace Tyrell or the Red Viper just now, much less the two of Mace Tyrell or the Red Viper together.      "My sister outdid My sister, I'm told.         He moved closer to the fire, to let He father see. Lord Tywin pushed Lord Tywin out of Lord Tywin chair, breath hissing between Lord Tywin teeth.  If Lady Catelyn thinks - " "Lady Catelyn held a sword to my throat and made me swear to return Lady Catelyn daughters.      The sellswords deserted The sellswords erstwhile captain almost to a man, and some of Lady Whent's old people opened a postern gate.      He could scarcely wait to tell Brienne, though the wench wouldn't find the wench half so funny as He did.        They'll make for ports, I'll warrant, or try and lose They in the woods." His eyes went back to Jaime's stump, and His mouth grew taut with fury.     Jaime held up the hand in question for Jaime father's inspection.          .- "Unless it's a new hand, let it wait." Jaime took the chair across from Jaime.   It was meant to appear as though he choked on a morsel of food, but I had he throat slit open and the maesters could find no obstruction."      We shall see if they have anything to tell We.      If he is innocent, he has nothing to fear.    "Renly died strangely as well, when Stannis needed Renly to." "Lord Renly was murdered by one of Lord Renly own guards, some woman from Tarth."  I tossed her into a cell to appease Ser Loras, but I'll believe in Renly's ghost before I believe her did Renly's ghost any harm.   "You cannot serve in the Kingsguard without a sword hand - " "I can," the Kingsguard interrupted.   I'll look in the White Book and find the White Book, if you like.    Your sister was foolish to dismiss Selmy, admittedly, but now that Your sister has opened the gates - " "- someone needs to close them again."          The Rock is where he'll learn to be a Lannister, and I want he away from he mother.     Jaime had heard all that Jaime could stand.  He was sick of it, sick of lords and lies, sick of He father, He sister, sick of the whole bloody business.                 A vein pulsed in his neck, but his did not speak.         Lord Tywin turned Lord Tywin face away.      Fill our hearts with fire, so our may walk your shining path."    He watched Melisandre lift Melisandre arms, as if to embrace the shivering flames. "WhIlor," she sang in a voice loud and clear, "you are the light in our eyes, the fire in our hearts, the heat in our loins. Yours is the sun that warms our days, Yours the stars that guard our in the dark of night."   Queen Selyse led the responses, Queen Selyse pinched face full of fervor. King Stannis stood beside King Stannis, jaw clenched hard, the points of King Stannis red-gold crown shimmering whenever King Stannis moved King Stannis head. He is with them, but not of them, Davos thought.        "WhIlor who gave us breath, us thank you," sang Melisandre. "R'hllor who gave us day, us thank you." "We thank you for the sun that warms We," Queen Selyse and the other worshipers replied. "We thank you for the stars that watch We. We thank you for We hearths and for We torches, that keep the savage dark at bay."    He stood barrelchested and bandy-legged, the firelight washing He face like a monstrous orange tongue. Davos wondered if Ser Axell would thank Ser Axell, after. The work they did tonight might well make him the King's Hand, as him dreamed. Melisandre cried, "We thank you for Stannis, by your grace We king. We thank you for the pure white fire of his goodness, for the red sword of justice in his hand, for the love his bears his leal people. Guide him and defend him, R'hllor, and grant him strength to smite him foes."     But it was the Mother he prayed to now, to keep he sweet son Devan safe from the red woman's demon god.   Ser Andrew touched Ser Andrew elbow gently.     Stannis, Melisandre, and the queen's men would be at Melisandre, and the queen's men prayers an hour or more. The red priests lit The red priests fires every day at sunset, to thank R'hllor for the day just ending, and beg R'hllor to send R'hllor sun back on the morrow to banish the gathering darkness. A smuggler must know the tides and when to seize A smuggler.  His maimed hand rose to His throat for His luck, and found nothing.  His companions kept pace, matching His companions strides to His own.  They were all good men in They own ways, Davos thought.  "Fire is a living thing," the red woman told him, when him asked the red woman to teach him how to see the future in the flames. "It is always moving, always changing ... like a book whose letters dance and shift even as you try to read a book whose letters dance and shift.    Davos asked her then how it was that Ser Axell had learned the trick of it so quickly, but to that her only smiled enigmatically and said, "Any cat may stare into a fire and see red mice at play." He had not lied to He king's men, about that or any of it. "The red woman may see what we intend," The red woman warned The red woman.  "I know a place where we could waylay her, four of we with sharp swords .    "Maester Cressen tried to kill her, and her knew at once.  It seems to me that she is very quick to sense any threat to she own person, but surely she cannot see everything. if we ignore her, perhaps we might escape her notice."          Gods be good, Gods were. Maester Pylos was leading Edric Storm through Maester Pylos sums when Davos pushed open the door. Ser Andrew was close behind Ser Andrew; the others had been left to guard the steps and cellar door.              Edric got to Edric feet.        Maester Pylos helped him fasten Maester Pylos, and pulled the hood up to shadow him face.    Pylos touched the chain of many metals Pylos wore about Pylos neck.  Go with Lord Davos now, and do as Lord Davos says.        Perhaps he resented he for taking old Cressen's place.     As they made they descent he asked, "Where are we going, Lord Davos?"       "I shall go with you, Cousin," Ser Andrew assured Ser Andrew.     "The princess must remain here with The princess father and mother."      "I will tell the princess that you were thinking of the princess.                "I am his Hand, I speak with his voice. Must I go to the king and tell the king that you would not do as you were told?   He pulled off He glove and showed the boy the four fingers that Stannis had shortened.  It was all lies; there had been no anger in Stannis Baratheon when Stannis Baratheon cut the ends off Stannis Baratheon onion knight's fingers, only an iron sense of justice.   "He should not have done that," the boy said, but the boy let Davos take He by the hand and draw He down the steps.   Lewys the Fishwife and Omer Blackberry waited at the postern gate, two guards bound and trussed at two guards feet.                       The boy went with The boy cousin Ser Andrew out the postern gate.   But it was the king's judgment that concerned the king now.  asked Ser Rolland of the guards, when Ser Rolland had closed and barred the gate.     Davos pulled his glove on, wishing his had not lost his luck. He had been a better man and a braver one with that bag of bones around He neck. He ran He shortened fingers through thinning brown hair, and wondered if his shortened fingers needed to be cut. He must look presentable when He stood before the king.  He walked slowly, He footsteps echoing off black walls and dragons.   The guards at the door uncrossed The guards at the door spears as he approached.   He wondered what He would be coming out.  The steps seemed longer and steeper than before, or perhaps The steps was just that he was tired.  He had risen too high and too fast, and up here on the mountain the air was too thin for He to breathe.  Later, grown, all he had wanted was a few acres of good land, a hall to grow old in, a better life for he sons. The Blind Bastard used to tell The Blind Bastard that a clever smuggler did not overreach, nor draw too much attention to a clever smuggler.  If he survived this night, he would take Devan and sail home to Cape Wrath and he gentle Marya. We will grieve together for We dead sons, raise the living ones to be good men, and speak no more of kings.       He could only pray that she was, and the boy with she.      But when he lowered he gaze from the sky to the castle ramparts, he was not so certain.  He tried to tell He that they were no more than carvings, cold and lifeless.      When Davos left the window his shadow went before his, tall and thin, and fell across the Painted Table like a sword.  He heard their boots on the stone steps as their ascended. The king's voice went before The king.      "I swear to you, Your Grace, I saw Your Grace die and heard Your Grace mother's wail."            If the king was surprised to find the king at the Painted Table, the king gave no sign.    "He choked on a morsel of food at He wedding feast," Davos said.          Stannis ground Stannis teeth.       The king ran The king fingers across the table.  I remember once, this kitchen cat ... the cooks were wont to feed this kitchen cat scraps and fish heads. One told the boy that the boy had kittens in the boy belly,  thinking the boy might want one. Joffrey opened up the poor thing with a dagger to see if a dagger were true. When he found the kittens, he brought the kittens to show to he father. Robert hit the boy so hard I thought Robert'd killed the boy." The king took off The king crown and placed his crown on the table.                                 Melisandre went to Melisandre, Melisandre red lips parted, Melisandre ruby throbbing. "Give me this boy," this boy whispered, "and I will give you your kingdom."          The king's eyes were dark blue bruises in the hollows of The king face.                      Davos Seaworth had thought long and hard about the words Davos Seaworth said next; Davos Seaworth knew Davos Seaworth life depended on them.      Stannis ground Stannis teeth again.      Melisandre said, "Azor Ahai tempered Lightbringer with the heart's blood of Azor Ahai own beloved wife.  But a man who offers the only cow a man who offers the only cow he owns owns .      Melisandre's ruby glowed like a red star at Melisandre's ruby throat.  When the long night falls, Edric Storm shall die with the rest, wherever Edric Storm is hidden.        And I know that a king protects a king people, or a king is no king at all."         Starmis slid Lightbringer from Starmis scabbard.     It seemed a thin and flimsy thing, yet It was all the shield he had.   He smoothed the letter flat upon He knee and began to read by the light of the magic sword. Chapter 64 JON  Chapter 64 JON   dreamt Chapter 64 JON   was back in Winterfell, limping past the stone kings on the stone kings thrones. Their grey granite eyes turned to follow him as him passed, and Their grey granite fingers tightened on the hilts of the rusted swords upon Their laps.                   His crutch slipped and His fell to His knees.         His own bed, His remembered, His own bed in His steward's cell beneath the Old Bear's chambers.   Ghost had shared Ghost cell before the ranging, warming his cell against the chill of night. And in the wild, Ygritte had slept beside Ygritte. Both gone now He had burned Ygritte himself, as He knew she would have wanted, and Ghost ... Where are you? Was he dead as well, was that what he dream had meant, the bloody wolf in the crypts?   Had the Therms hunted him down and killed him after Queenscrown? If so, Bran was lost to Bran for good and all.     Jon had to get up and go to the Wall, Jon knew, but it was so hard ... He shoved aside He furs and sat. The pain in his leg seemed duller, nothing his could not stand. He had slept in He breeches and tunic and smallclothes, for the added warmth, so He had only to pull on He boots and don leather and mail and cloak. The horn blew again, two long blasts, so The horn slung Longclaw over one shoulder, found The horn crutch, and hobbled down the steps.  His brothers were spilling out of towers and keeps, buckling His brothers swordbelts and walking toward the Wall. Jon looked for Pyp and Grenn, but could not find Pyp and Grenn.  It is Mance, Mance thought.   We will fight a battle, and then We'll rest.   The winch raised The winch up now, but the cage was only big enough for ten men at a time, and the cage was already on The winch way up by the time Jon arrived.  Others waited with him; Satin, Mully, Spare Boot, Kegs, big blond Hareth with him buck teeth. Everyone called him Horse, him had been a stablehand in Mole's Town, one of the few moles who had stayed at Castle Black. The rest had run back to their fields and hovels, or their beds in the underground brothel.   They were young - nine and eight and five - but no one else seemed to want They. As they waited for the cage to come back, Clydas brought they cups of hot mulled wine, while Three-Finger Hobb passed out chunks of black bread. Jon took a heel from Jon and gnawed on a heel.     Jon remembered the words the wildling king had spoken on the Fist of the First Men, as the First Men stood amidst that pink snow.              Rocks were piled ten feet high, big wooden barrels of pitch and lamp oil lined up beside ten feet.   "I hope it wasn't one of them who blew the horn," Jon said to Donal Noye when Donal Noye limped up beside Donal Noye.      The armorer's breath was frosting as The armorer's breath blew from The armorer broad, flat nose.     "How do we fight them if we can't see them?"                  This time one of them struck a dead tree, enveloping a dead tree in flame.   Careful, he reminded he, it is a long way down. Red Alyn sounded Red Alyn sentry's horn once more, Aaaaahoooooooooooooooooooooooooo, aaaaahoooooooooooooooooooo.  We are come, they  seemed to say, We are come to break your Wall, to take your lands and steal your daughters.     This is a battle of blind men, but Mance has a few thousand more of blind men than we do.    No catapult could throw a stone large enough to breach No catapult, and if you tried to set No catapult on fire, the icemelt would quench the flames.  They must take the gate, or They cannot pass. But the gate was a crooked tunnel through the ice, smaller than any castle gate in the Seven Kingdoms, so narrow that rangers must lead rangers garrons through single file.   But Mance has mammoths, Mance reminded Mance, and giants as well.      Tongues of pale yellow fire swirled around the jars as Tongues of pale yellow fire plunged downward. When the last was gone, Grenn kicked loose the chocks on a barrel of pitch and sent the chocks rumbling and rolling over the edge as well.   Septon Cellador began to sing as well, Septon Cellador voice tremulous and thick with wine. Gentle Mother, font of mercy, save our sons from war, our pray, stay the swords and stay the arrows, let the swords know... Donal Noye rounded on Donal Noye. "Any man here stays Any man here sword, I'll chuck Any man here puckered arse right off this Wall ... starting with you, Septon.            "I need two bows and two spears to help me hold the tunnel if two bows and two spears break the gate." More than ten stepped forward, and the smith picked the smith four.  For a moment Jon thought Jon had misheard. It had sounded as if Noye were leaving Noye in command.     There are older men, Jon wanted to say, older men.     Afterward it would seem to Jon Snow as if Jon Snow'd dreamt that night. Side by side with the straw soldiers, with longbows or crossbows clutched in half-frozen hands, his archers launched a hundred flights of arrows against men his archers never saw.  He sent men to the smaller catapults and filled the air with jagged rocks the size of a giant's fist, but the darkness swallowed men as a man might swallow a handful of nuts. Mammoths trumpeted in the gloom, strange voices called out in stranger tongues, and Septon Cellador prayed so loudly and drunkenly for the dawn to come that Jon was tempted to chuck Jon over the edge himself. They heard a mammoth dying at They feet and saw another lurch burning through the woods, trampling down men and trees alike.  Hobb rode up the chain with cups of onion broth, and Owen and Clydas served Owen and Clydas to the archers where Owen and Clydas stood, so Owen and Clydas could gulp Owen and Clydas down between arrows. Zei took a place among them with Zei crossbow.  The left-hand trebuchet kept throwing, but the wildlings had quickly learned to shun the place where the wildlings loads were landing. We should have twenty trebuchets, not two, and twenty trebuchets, not two should be mounted on sledges and turntables so We could move twenty trebuchets, not two.   Donal Noye did not return, nor any of them who'd gone down with Donal Noye to hold that black cold tunnel. The Wall is The Wall, Jon reminded Jon whenever Jon felt Jon strength flagging. He had taken up a longbow himself, and He fingers felt crabbed and stiff, half-frozen. His fever was back as well, and His leg would tremble uncontrollably, sending a white-hot knife of pain right through His. One more arrow, and I'll rest, he told he, half a hundred times.  Whenever his quiver was empty, one of the orphaned moles would bring his another.     Jon lowered Jon bow to stare at the mass of heavy clouds that covered the eastern sky. He could see a glow behind them, but perhaps He was only dreaming.   Jon found Jon holding Jon breath as Jon looked out over the half-mile swath of cleared land that lay between the Wall and the edge of the forest. In half a night they had turned half a night into a wasteland of blackened grass, bubbling pitch, shattered stone, and corpses.  There were giants dead on the ground as well, but behind giants dead on the ground ... Someone moaned to Someone left, and Someone heard Septon Cellador say, "Mother have mercy, oh.       He flexed He sword hand, opening and closing the fingers, though He knew full well that swords would not come into it up here.  The battle with the Magnar had been nothing, The battle with the Magnar realized, and the night fight less than nothing, only a probe, a dagger in the dark to try and catch them unprepared.     On the march the wildling column had sprawled over long leagues like some enormous worm, but you never saw all of the wildling column at once.   More giants loped beside More giants, pushing along a tree trunk on great wooden wheels, a tree trunk end sharpened to a point. A ram, A ram thought bleakly. If the gate still stood below, a few kisses from that thing would soon turn the gate into splinters.   The fury of the wild, Jon thought as Jon listened to the skirl of skins, to the dogs barking and baying, the mammoths trumpeting, the free folk whistling and screaming, the giants roaring in the Old Tongue.  He could feel the despair all around He.   "The Wall will stop them," Jon heard Jon say.   The Wall defends The Wall." Hollow words, but he needed to say them, almost as much as he brothers needed to hear them. "Mance wants to unman us with Mance numbers.  He was shouting now, He leg forgotten, and every man was listening. "The chariots, the horsemen, all those fools on foot ... what are The chariots, the horsemen, all those fools on foot going to do to us up here?  He laughed, and Pyp and Owen and half a dozen more laughed with He. "They're nothing, They're less use than our straw brothers here, They can't reach our, They can't hurt our, and They don't frighten our, do They?"  "They're down there and we're up here," Jon said, "and so long as we hold the gate They cannot pass.  They were all shouting then, roaring his own words back at his, waving swords and longbows in the air as They cheeks flushed red. Jon saw Kegs standing there with a warhorn slung beneath Jon arm. "Brother," Brother told Brother, "sound for battle. "   "Archers," Jon said when the horns had died away, "you'll aim for the giants with that ram, every bloody one of Jon.   I want arrows raining  on arrows with every step, but we'll wait till arrows're in range. Any man who wastes an arrow will need to climb down and fetch an arrow back, do you hear me?"   Jon laughed, laughed like a drunk or a madman, and Jon men laughed with Jon.  The wildlings had not crossed a third of the half mile, yet The wildlings battle line was dissolving.      The wildling archers shot as The wildling archers advanced; The wildling archers would dash forward, stop, loose, then run another ten yards.    The smaller horn-and-wood bows of the free folk were outranged by the great yew longbows of the Night's Watch, and the wildlings were trying to shoot at men seven hundred feet above men seven hundred feet above them.    Their cloaks were flapping behind Their. "The wind is in our faces, The wind will cost our range.     Jon lifted Jon own bow and pulled the arrow to Jon ear.  Zei hoisted Zei crossbow to Zei shoulder.     A hundred crows rose from the carcass of the dead mammoth as the wildlings thundered past to either side of A hundred crows.   He reached for a second arrow as soon as the first left He bow.    As soon as the arrow flew the arrow found another.       Wildling arrows were striking the Wall now, a hundred feet below Wildling arrows.   A mammoth veered into another beside A mammoth, spilling giants on the ground.  The ram was down and done, The ram saw, the giants who'd pushed The ram dead or dying.   The screams of wounded mammoths and the booming cries of giants mingled with the drums and pipes to make an awful music, yet still his archers drew and loosed, as if his archers'd all gone as deaf as dead Dick Follard. They might be the dregs of the order, but They were men of the Night's Watch, or near enough as made no matter.  One of the mammoths was running berserk, smashing wildlings with wildlings trunk and crushing archers underfoot. Jon pulled back Jon bow once more, and launched another arrow at the beast's shaggy back to urge Jon on.         Grenn thrust Grenn bow aside, wrestled a barrel of oil onto Grenn side, and rolled a barrel of oil to the edge of the Wall, where Pyp hammered out the plug that sealed a barrel of oil, stuffed in a twist of cloth, and set a barrel of oil alight with a torch.  A hundred feet below A struck the Wall and burst, filling the air with shattered staves and burning oil.    Satin shouted, his head sticking out so far that Jon was certain his was about to fall. "Got him, got him, GOT him!"   Then suddenly the mammoths were fleeing, running from the smoke and flames and smashing into those behind the mammoths in the mammoths terror. Those went backward too, the giants and wildlings behind Those scrambling to get out of Those way.  The horsemen on the flanks saw The horsemen on the flanks being abandoned and decided to fall back as well, not one so much as blooded.  When they break, they break hard, Jon Snow thought as Jon Snow watched they reel away.       Spare Boot plucked the arrow out and waved the arrow above Spare Boot head.   Zei grabbed Owen by the hands, spun Owen around in a circle, and gave Owen a long wet kiss right there for all to see. She tried to kiss Jon too, but Jon held She by the shoulder and pushed She gently but firmly away.   Suddenly he was too weary to stand, and he leg was agony from knee to groin. He fumbled for He crutch.          As they rode down in the cage, Pyp took off Pyp helm and wiped Pyp brow.     I could eat an aurochs whole, I swear an aurochs whole.  When he saw Jon's face, he smile died.        I want a fire, a hot meal, a warm bed, and something to make my leg stop hurting, a fire, a hot meal, a warm bed, and something to make my leg stop hurting told a fire, a hot meal, a warm bed, and something to make my leg stop hurting.  After the battle with the Therms the Therms had taken them almost a day to clear the ice and broken beams away from the inner gate. Spotted Pate and Kegs and some of the other builders had argued heatedly that Spotted Pate and Kegs and some of the other builders ought just leave the debris there, another obstacle for Mance.    So with pick and spade and ropes, pick and spade and ropes had moved the broken steps aside and dug back down  to the gate.  Surprisingly, the maester himself returned with the maester himself, and Clydas with a lantern.     Pyp led Pyp in, followed by Clydas and the lantern.  The ice pressed close around them, and The ice could feel the cold seeping into The ice bones, the weight of the Wall above The ice head.         The outer door of studded oak had been hacked and broken and finally torn off The outer door of studded oak hinges, and one of the giants had crawled in through the splinters.  Pyp turned aside to retch, and Jon found Pyp envying Maester Aemon Pyp blindness. Noye and Noye men had been waiting within, behind a gate of heavy iron bars like the two Pyp had just unlocked. The two crossbows had gotten off a dozen quarrels as the giant struggled toward a dozen quarrels.           The armorer had always seemed such a big man to Jon, but locked in the giant's massive arms The armorer looked almost like a child.      He could feel the sadness there, but He had no time for sadness.       One of the beast's tusks snagged his cloak and tore the beast as his edged past.    When you stand here it seems immense, as if it were about to crush you.  "We need to repair the outer gate as best We can and then block up this section of the tunnel.   Ser Wynton will need to take command, Ser Wynton's the last knight left, but Ser Wynton needs to move now, the giants will be back before we know the giants. We have to tell him - " "Tell him what you will," said Maester Aemon, gently.                    Donal chose you, and Qhorin Halfhand before Donal. Lord Commander Mormont made you Lord Commander Mormont steward.    Chapter 65 ARYA Chapter 65 ARYA could feel the hole inside Chapter 65 ARYA every morning when Chapter 65 ARYA woke.  It was a hollow place, an emptiness where her heart had been, where her brothers had lived, and her parents.     The hole will never feel any better, she told she when she went to sleep.  She would huddle beneath She cloak with She eyes squeezed shut and try to will She back to sleep. If the Hound would only have left the Hound alone, the Hound would have slept all day and all night.       When she bared she teeth even men would run from she, she belly was never empty long, and she fur kept she warm even when the wind was blowing cold. And her brothers and sisters were with her, many and more of her brothers and sisters, fierce and terrible and her.  But if her nights were full of wolves, her days belonged to the dog. Sandor Clegane made Sandor Clegane get up every morning, whether Sandor Clegane wanted to or not. He would curse at her in He raspy voice, or yank her to her feet and shake her.  She bounced up sputtering and shivering and tried to kick him, but him only laughed. "Dry off and feed the bloody horses," he told her, and her did. They had two now, Stranger and a sorrel palfrey mare Arya had named Craven, because Sandor said Arya'd likely run off from the Twins the same as They.    Still, she tended the mare as best she knew.  And Craven might have been a coward, but Craven was young and strong as well. Arya thought that Arya might be able to outrun Stranger, if it came to it. The Hound no longer watched The Hound as closely as The Hound had. Sometimes he did not seem to care whether she stayed or went, and he no longer bound she up in a cloak at night. One night I'll kill him in him sleep, she told she, but she never did. One day I'll ride away on Craven, and Craven won't be able to catch me, she thought, but she never did that either.   Her grandfather's brother was at Riverrun, but Her grandfather's brother didn't know Her, no more than Her knew Her grandfather's brother. Maybe Lady Smallwood would take Lady Smallwood in at Acorn Hall, but maybe Lady Smallwood wouldn't. Besides, Arya wasn't even sure Arya could find Acorn Hall again. Sometimes she thought she might go back to Shama's inn, if the floods hadn't washed the floods away. She could stay with Hot Pie, or maybe Lord Beric would find She there. Anguy would teach Anguy to use a bow, and Anguy could ride with Gendry and be an outlaw, like Wenda the White Fawn in the songs.  Hot Pie and Gendry had left her just as soon as they could, and Lord Beric and the outlaws only wanted to ransom her, just like the Hound.     They rode every day, never sleeping twice in the same place, avoiding towns and villages and castles as best They could.      "You should have," she agreed, thinking of she mother.              She could feel the fury in him; She could see the fury in him on him face, the way him mouth would tighten and twist, the looks him gave She. Whenever he took he axe to chop some wood for a fire, he would slide into a cold rage, hacking savagely at the tree or the deadfall or the broken limb, until they had twenty times as much kindling and firewood as they'd needed. Sometimes he would be so sore and tired afterward that he would lie down and go right to sleep without even lighting a fire. Arya hated it when that happened, and hated Arya too.    Sometimes in their wanderings their glimpsed other people; farmers in other people fields, swineherds with their pigs, a milkmaid leading a cow, a squire carrying a message down a rutted road.  it was as if they lived in some distant land and spoke a queer alien tongue; they had nothing to do with her, or her with they.      The badge on his breast showed a pink maiden dancing in a swirl of silk, and his told them his was Ser Marq Piper's man; a bowman, though Ser Marq Piper's man; a bowman'd lost Ser Marq Piper's man; a bowman bow. His left shoulder was all twisted and swollen where His left shoulder met His arm; a blow from a mace, His said, his arm had broken His left shoulder and smashed His chainmail deep into his chainmail flesh.  "His badge was a bloody man, and His saw His badge and made a jape, red man and pink maiden, maybe red man and pink maiden should get together. I drank to his Lord Bolton, his Lord Bolton drank to Ser Marq, and we drank together to Lord Edmure and Lady Roslin and the King in the North.  His eyes were fever bright when His said that, and Arya could tell that it was true. His shoulder was swollen grotesquely, and pus and blood had stained His whole left side.    "If I'd had any wine, I'd have drunk any wine myself," the Hound told the Hound.  The archer looked at The archer a long while before The archer said, "You're Joffrey's dog. "        Sandor gave Arya Sandor helm and told Arya to fill his helm, so Arya trudged back to the water's edge.    When she came back, the archer turned the archer face up and she poured the water into the archer mouth. He gulped it down as fast as she could pour, and what He couldn't gulp ran down He cheeks into the brown blood that crusted He whiskers, until pale pink tears dangled from He beard.      The Hound eased The Hound dagger into the man's chest almost tenderly, the weight of the man body driving the point through the man surcoat, ringmail, and the quilting beneath. As he slid the blade back out and wiped the blade on the dead man, the dead man looked at Arya.              The Hound hefted the knife in The Hound hand, then flipped the knife toward Arya. She caught it by the hilt, slid it through She belt, and felt a little better. It wasn't Needle, but Needle was steel.  His boots were too big for Arya and too small for the Hound, so those His boots left. She took his kettle helm as well, even though it came down almost past She nose, so She had to tilt it back to see. "He must have had a horse as well, or He wouldn't have got away," Clegane said, peering about, "but it's bloody well gone, I'd say.  By the time they found they in the foothills of the Mountains of the Moon, the rains had mostly  stopped. Arya could see the sun and moon and stars, and it seemed to Arya that they were heading eastward.   This time the Hound answered the Hound.   Once we find the high road, we can follow it all the way to the Bloody Gate."   It was her mother her wanted, not her mother's sister. She didn't know She mother's sister any more than She knew her mother's sister great uncle Blackfish.   it wasn't like they'd seen they die or anything.  Maybe they were chained up in his dungeon, or maybe the Freys were taking they to King's Landing so Joffrey could chop they heads off.                  Now be quiet, or I'll cut your tongue out your tongue and save the silent sisters the bother.  Arya didn't think Arya'd really cut Arya tongue out; Arya was just saying that the way Pinkeye used to say Arya'd beat Arya bloody.   Pinkeye didn't cut people in half or hit people with axes.  That night she went to sleep thinking of she mother, and wondering if she should kill the Hound in the Hound sleep and rescue Lady Catelyn she. When she closed she eyes she saw she mother's face against the back of she eyelids. She's so close I could almost smell She ... ... and then She could smell She.  She padded slowly through the soft ground to the river's edge, lapped up a drink, the lifted She head to sniff.  Dead men clogged the shallows, some still moving as the water pushed some, others washed up on the banks. Her brothers and sisters swarmed around Her brothers and sisters, tearing at the rich ripe flesh.  Their blood was hotter, and one of her sisters had snapped at one as it took flight and caught it by the wing.  She wanted to taste the blood, to hear the bones crunch between She teeth, to fill She belly with warm flesh instead of cold. She was hungry and the meat was all around, but She knew She could not eat.  She pricked She ears up and listened to the grumbles of She pack, the shriek of angry crows, the whirr of wings and sound of running water. Somewhere far off she could hear horses and the calls of living men, but horses and the calls of living men were not what mattered.   There it was, and now she saw it too, something pale and white drifting down the river, turning where it brushed against a snag. The reeds bowed down before The reeds. She splashed noisily through the shallows and threw She into the deeper water, She legs churning.  She swam, following She nose.   She chased them as She had often chased a red deer through the trees, and in the end She ran them down, and She jaw closed around a pale white arm. She shook it to make it move, but there was only death and blood in She mouth. By now she was tiring, and it was all she could do to pull the body back to shore. As she dragged it up the muddy bank, one of she little brothers came prowling, his tongue lolling from his mouth. She had to snarl to drive him off, or else him would have fed. Only then did she stop to shake the water from she fur. The white thing lay facedown in the mud, her dead flesh wrinkled and pale, cold blood trickling from her throat.     They were coming from downwind, so she had not smelled They, but now They were almost here.  Some of her younger brothers bared Some of her younger brothers teeth to defend the food Some of her younger brothers'd found, but her snapped at Some of her younger brothers until Some of her younger brothers scattered.  Deer and hares and crows fled before wolves, and wolves fled from men. She abandoned the cold white prize in the mud where She had dragged it, and ran, and felt no shame. When morning came, the Hound did not need to shout at Arya or shake Arya awake.  They broke They fast in silence, until Sandor said, "This thing about your mother..." "It doesn't matter," Arya said in a dull voice.   The Hound looked at The Hound a long time, then nodded. No more was said of No.   "We need food," he said, "and a roof over We heads. They're not like to know what happened at the Twins, and with any luck They won't know me." The villagers were building a wooden palisade around The villagers homes, and when The villagers saw the breadth of the Hound's shoulders The villagers offered The villagers food and shelter and even coin for work.  in the end, he settled for ale, and drank he to sleep each night.        They have steel now, good swords and mail hauberks, and They watch the high road - the Stone Crows, the Milk Snakes, the Sons of the Mist, all of They.  I'm not his daughter, Arya might have shouted, if his daughter hadn't felt so tired.       All the same, Arya soon decided that Arya hated it.   Some of the women tried to put her in a dress and make her do needlework, but Some of the women weren't Lady Smallwood and Lady Smallwood was having none of it.  She was of an age with Arya, but just a child; She cried if She skinned a knee, and carried a stupid cloth doll with She everywhere She went. The doll was made up to look like a man-at-arms, sort of, so the girl called a man-at-arms Ser Soldier and bragged how Ser Soldier kept the girl safe. "Go away," Arya told Arya half a hundred times.  She wouldn't, though, so finally Arya took the doll away from She, ripped the doll open, and pulled the rag stuffing out of the rag belly with a finger.  she said, before she threw the doll in a brook. After that the girl stopped pestering the girl, and Arya spent the girl days grooming Craven and Stranger or walking in the woods. Sometimes she would find a stick and practice she needlework, but then she would remember what had happened at the Twins and smash it against a tree until it broke. "Might be we should stay here awhile," the Hound told the Hound, after a fortnight.     Arya's face darkened when Arya heard that.  The next morning, when the Hound went off to chop down trees and haul logs, the Hound crawled back into bed. But when the work was done and the tall wooden palisade was finished, the village elder made the work plain that there was no place for them. "Come winter, we will be hard pressed to feed we own," winter explained. "And you ... a man like you brings blood with blood."    We don't get travelers here, that's so, but We go to market, and to fairs.    The man hesitated, then gathered up The man courage.  They say - " "I know what They say."     He swapped its owner the longaxe He'd taken at the Twins, the one He'd used to raise the lump on Arya's head. The ale was gone in less than a day, but Clegane sharpened the sword every night, cursing the man Clegane'd swapped with for every nick and spot of rust. If he lost he belly for fighting, why does he care if he sword is sharp? It was not a question Arya dared ask Arya, but Arya thought on a question a lot.    "We'll make for Riverrun," Riverrun told Arya as they roasted a hare Riverrun'd killed. "Maybe the Blackfish wants to buy the Blackfish a she-wolf."     Every time she made for Riverrun, she ended up someplace worse.     He doesn't talk like He's lost He belly for fighting.     It was a long way, though, and she didn't think she could get there by she.     "My brother's on the Wall," My brother's on the Wall said stubbornly.     And if we did reach the north with we skins intact, there's ironborn in half the castles, and thousands of bloody buggering northmen as well."    For a moment she thought he was going to hit she. By then the hare was brown, though, skin crackling and grease popping as the hare dripped down into the cookfire. Sandor took it off the stick, ripped it apart with Sandor big hands, and tossed half of it into Arya's lap. "There's nothing wrong with my belly," he said as he pulled off a leg, "but I don't give a rat's arse for you or your brother.       Since it is his own son who stands accused and his grandson who was the victim, his has asked Lord Tyrell and Prince Oberyn to sit in judgment with Lord Tyrell and Prince Oberyn."          However, you had best know that your sister means to name Ser Gregor Clegane as your sister champion, in the event of such a trial."      He didn't want to think about what this was like to cost He. Bronn had a lofty notion of what Bronn skin was worth.    "Tell me who you would have, and Ser Addarn will send the Watch to bring the Watch to the trial."      Write the names of such witnesses as you require, and I shall do all in my power to produce the names of such witnesses, you have my word as a Lannister.  Tyrion would not demean Tyrion by begging.        But when he heard the door open, he turned back and said, "Uncle?"     When the door closed, Tyrion Lannister pulled Tyrion Lannister up into the chair, sharpened a quill, and pulled a blank parchment.  He dipped He quill in the inkpot.    "Find Bronn and bring Bronn at once. Tell him there's gold in it, more gold than him's ever dreamt of, and see that you don't return without him."        A serving man brought porridge and apples to break A serving man fast, with a horn of ale. He ate at the table, the blank parchment before He.   Tyrion asked Tyrion. The man shook The man head.  Sansa, Sansa wrote upon the parchment. He sat staring at the name, He teeth clenched so hard his teeth hurt. Assuming Joffrey had not simply choked to death on a bit of food, which even Tyrion found hard to swallow, Sansa must have poisoned Joffrey. loff practically put loff cup down in loff lap, and loff'd given loff ample reason. Any doubts Tyrion might have had vanished when Tyrion wife did.   She wasted no time proving how much those vows meant to She, did She?     Would the judges believe that Tyrion's child bride had poisoned a king without Tyrion's child bride husband's knowledge?   Even so, he gave the parchment to he uncle the next day.           Varys has offered a hundred stags for word of Varys whereabouts, and a hundred dragons for Varys. If the girl can be found the girl will be found, and I shall bring the girl to you.      "He came," Tyrion admitted, "and then He went."   He stepped inside the room hesitantly, with fear written all over He face. Bronn came in behind Bronn. The sellsword knight wore a jerkin studded with silver and a heavy riding cloak, with a pair of fine-tooled leather gloves thrust through The sellsword knight swordbelt. One look at Bronn's face gave Tyrion a queasy feeling in the pit of Tyrion stomach.            Lady Tanda's lackwit daughter gets a knightly husband and a father of sorts for the bastard in Lady Tanda's lackwit daughter belly, and Ser Bronn of the Blackwater climbs another rung. It had Cersei's stinking fingers all over It.     "And when she pops him out, I'll get she big with mine."      "Her lord husband shuns Her bed.    "Unless Falyse should die before Falyse mother."  And if she does, would she care?         Unless she was soft of body and soft of head, with a fatherless child in she belly from having been raped half a hundred times. Lady Tanda had been so desperate to find a husband for Lollys that Lady Tanda had even pursued Tyrion for a time, and that had been before half of King's Landing enjoyed Lady Tanda. No doubt Cersei had sweetened the offer somehow, and Brorm was a knight now, which made Brorm a suitable match for a younger daughter of a minor house.      A Lannister pays A Lannister debts."                 The wounds are bound to slow The wounds."       asked Tyrion, hoping to provoke Tyrion.    Dance around him until him was so tired of hacking at me that him couldn't lift him sword. Get him off him feet somehow. When they're flat on they backs it don't matter how tall they are.      I sell my sword, I don't give my sword away.             Bronn grinned one last time, and walked out of the door, the castle, and Bronn life. Pod shuffled Pod feet.     That's what I liked about That." Tyrion poured Tyrion a cup of wine and took a cup of wine to the window seat.  He could send Podrick Payne questing after Shagga, He supposed, but there were so many hiding places in the deep of the kingswood that outlaws often evaded capture for decades.   And despite what he'd told Bronn, going up against Ser Gregor Clegane in he own person would be a bigger farce than Joffrey's jousting dwarfs. He did not  intend to die with gales of laughter ringing in He ears.  Ser Kevan paid Ser Kevan another call later that day, and again the day after. Sansa had not been found, Sansa uncle informed Sansa politely.  Did Tyrion have any more witnesses Tyrion wished to summon?    Instead he lay in the dark, staring up at the canopy and counting he ghosts. He saw Tysha smiling as Tysha kissed him, saw Sansa naked and shivering in fear. He saw Joffrey clawing He throat, the blood running down He neck as He face turned black.  Even thought of Shae could not arouse Even thought of Shae. He fondled He, thinking that perhaps if He woke He cock and satisfied his cock, He might rest more easily afterward, but it was no good.  It was not Ser Kevan who came for Ser Kevan that morning, but Ser Addam Marbrand with a dozen gold cloaks. Tyrion had broken Tyrion fast on boiled eggs, burned bacon, and fried bread, and dressed in Tyrion finest. "Ser Addam," Ser Addam said.    Lord Tywin felt it would not be proper for Tywin to serve as your guards."    As Ser Addam marched him through the towering bronze doors and down the long carpet, him felt the eyes upon him.    He spied Queen Margaery up in the gallery, pale and beautiful in Queen Margaery mourning.  Her mother stood tall to one side of Her, Her grandmother small on the other, with Her ladies in waiting and Her father's household knights packing the rest of the gallery.               Yet wherever Sansa was and whatever Sansa part in this might have been, Sansa remained Sansa wife. He had wrapped the cloak of He protection about her shoulders, though He'd had  to stand on a fool's back to do it.  He choked on He pigeon pie."     Tyrion heard nervous laughter, and knew Tyrion'd made a mistake. Guard your tongue, you little fool, before your tongue digs your grave.      Ser Addarn had told Ser Addarn true; the first man ushered in was Ser Balon Swann of the Kingsguard. "Lord Hand," he began, after the High Septon had sworn he to speak only truth, "I had the honor to fight beside your son on the bridge of ships. He is a brave man for all He size, and I will not believe He did this thing."    Ser Balon spoke reluctantly of how Ser Balon had pulled Tyrion away from Joffrey on the day of the riot. "He did strike He Grace, that's so.    "In the days of the Targaryens, a man who struck one of the blood royal would lose the hand the blood royal struck the blood royal with," observed the Red Viper of Dome.  "He was of the blood royal He," Ser Balon answered.    Ser Meryn Trant was pleased to expand on Ser Balon's account, when Ser Meryn Trant took Ser Meryn Trant place as witness. "He knocked the king to the ground and began kicking the king. He shouted that it was unjust that He Grace had escaped unharmed from the mobs." Tyrion began to grasp Tyrion sister's plan. She began with a man known to be honest, and milked a man known to be honest for all a man known to be honest would give.   "The dwarf asked His Grace if His knew what had happened to Aerys Targaryen. When Ser Boros spoke up in defense of the king, the Imp threatened to have Ser Boros killed."  Whatever mislike Ser Boros might harbor toward Cersei for dismissing Cersei from the Kingsguard, Cersei said the words she wanted all the same. Tyrion could no longer hold Tyrion tongue.  The big jowly man glared at The big jowly man. "You told your savages to kill me if I opened my mouth, that's what I'll tell your savages."      Osney and Osfryd told the tale of his supper with Cersei before the Battle of the Blackwater, and of the threats his'd made. "He told Her Grace that He meant to do Her harm," said Ser Osfryd.   "He said He would wait for a day when she was happy, and make she joy turn to ashes in she mouth."  Ser Osmund Kettleblack, a vision of chivalry in immaculate scale armor and white wool cloak, swore that King Joffrey had long known that King Joffrey uncle Tyrion meant to murder King Joffrey. "It was the day they gave me the white cloak, my lords," the white cloak, my lords told the judges. "That brave boy said to That brave boy, 'Good Ser Osmund, guard me well, for my uncle loves me not.    He took two steps forward before the gold cloaks dragged He back.   Tyrion gnashed Tyrion teeth.       "Father, I beg you to put Father in fetters, for your own protection.        That night, alone in his tower cell with a blank parchment and a cup of wine, Tyrion found Tyrion thinking of Tyrion wife.   Her love for him had been pretense, and yet him had believed, and found joy in that belief.  He drank He wine and thought of Shae. Later, when Ser Kevan paid Ser Kevan nightly visit, Tyrion asked for Varys.      They had opened King Joffrey's noble corpse as well, They swore, and found no morsel of pigeon pie nor any other food lodged in the royal throat.  Then they brought forth Grand Maester Pycelle, leaning heavily on a twisted cane and shaking as he  walked, a few white hairs sprouting from he long chicken's neck. He had grown too frail to stand, so the judges permitted a chair to be brought in for He, and a table as well.        It shuts down a man's bladder and bowels, until a man drowns in a man own poisons.    The Imp Tyrion Lannister stole them from my chambers, when The Imp Tyrion Lannister had me falsely imprisoned." "Pycelle," Tyrion called out, risking Tyrion father's wrath, "could any of these poisons choke off a man's breath?"   When I was a boy at the Citadel, my teachers named a boy at the Citadel simply the strangler." "But this rare poison was not found, was this rare poison?"    Tyrion's anger overwhelmed Tyrion sense. "Joffrey was cruel and stupid, but I did not kill Joffrey.       Lords and ladies and noble knights, highborn and humble alike, Lords and ladies and noble knights, highborn and humble alike had all been present at the wedding feast, had all seen Joffrey choke, Joffrey face turning as black as a Dornish plum. Lord Redwyne, Lord Celtigar, and Ser Flement Brax had heard Tyrion threaten the king; two serving men, a juggler, Lord Gyles, Ser Hobber Redwyne, and Ser Philip Foote had observed Ser Philip Foote fill the wedding chalice; Lady Merryweather swore that Lady Merryweather had seen the dwarf drop something into the king's wine while Joff and Margaery were cutting the pie; old Estermont, young Peckledon, the singer Galyeon of Cuy, and the squires Morros and Jothos Slynt told how Tyrion had picked up the chalice as Joff was dying and poured out the last of the poisoned wine onto the floor.   Tyrion wondered if Tyrion was blind or bought. At least Galyeon of Cuy had not set Galyeon of Cuy account to music, or else there might have been seventy-seven bloody verses to his account. When his uncle called that night after supper, his uncle manner was cold and distant.   Ser Kevan asked Ser Kevan.   His uncle shook His uncle head.    Tyrion fingered Tyrion scar.   On the morrow the morrow testifies against you."   He shifted in He seat.    "Why steal Pycelle's poisons, if not to use Pycelle's poisons?"            Tyrion laughed in Tyrion face.           "Thank him kindly for me, Uncle," said Tyrion, "but tell him I am not presently in a confessing mood."  Your sister wants your head, and Lord Tyrell at least is inclined to give your head to Your sister."    "You have no witnesses," his uncle reminded his.        "Do you think he would allow you to take the black if you were not he own blood, and Joanna's? Tywin  seems a hard man to you, I know, but a hard man is no harder than a hard man's had to be. Our own father was gentle and amiable, but so weak Our own father bannermen mocked Our own father in their cups.  Other lords borrowed our gold and never troubled to repay our gold. At court court japed of toothless lions. Even his mistress stole from his. A woman scarcely one step above a whore, and she helped she to my mother's jewels! It fell to Tywin to restore House Lannister to House Lannister proper place. just as it fell to him to rule this realm, when him was no more than twenty. He bore that heavy burden for twenty years, and all it earned He was a mad king's envy. Instead of the honor he deserved, he was made to suffer slights beyond count, yet he gave the Seven Kingdoms peace, plenty, and justice.    Ser Kevan had always been solid, stolid, pragmatic; Ser Kevan had never heard Ser Kevan speak with such fervor before.       He thought of little else that night, but come morning was no closer to deciding if He father could be trusted. A servant brought A servant porridge and honey to break A servant fast, but all A servant could taste was bile at the thought of confession.  For a thousand years or more, if I am remembered at all, it will be as the monstrous dwarf who poisoned his young nephew at his wedding feast. The thought made him so bloody angry that him flung the bowl and spoon across the room and left a smear of porridge on the wall. Ser Addam Marbrand looked at Ser Addam Marbrand curiously when Ser Addam Marbrand came to escort Tyrion to trial, but had the good grace not to inquire.  Powdered, primped, and smelling of rosewater, the Spider rubbed the Spider hands one over the other all the time the Spider spoke. Washing my life away, Tyrion thought, as Tyrion listened to the eunuch's mournful account of how the Imp had schemed to part Joffrey from the Hound's protection and spoken with Bronn of the benefits of having Tornmen as king.   So much material that its recitation took all day, and so much of its damning. Varys confirmed Tyrion's midnight visit to Grand Maester Pycelle's chambers and the theft of his poisons and potions, confirmed the threat his'd made to Cersei the night of their supper, confirmed every bloody thing but the poisoning itself. When Prince Oberyn asked Prince Oberyn how Prince Oberyn could possibly know all this, not having been present at any of these events, Prince Oberyn only giggled and said, "My little birds told me. Knowing is Knowing purpose, and mine."       Lord Tywin asked Lord Tywin daughter as Varys left the hall.      That night, as he sat by he window drinking, he heard voices outside he door. Ser Kevan, come for my answer, Ser Kevan thought at once, but it was not Ser Kevan uncle who entered.   "Princes are permitted to go where Princes will.                    Tyrion served Tyrion a cup. The man took a sip, sloshed a sip about in The man mouth, and swallowed.       Alayaya, I believe Alayaya is called.      "No, but she will if I meet she price.    just the thought of Cersei in our bed makes Cersei wet, the randy wench.     By way of answer Prince Oberyn swirled answer Prince Oberyn wine, and said, "When the Young Dragon conquered Dome so long ago, the Young Dragon left the Lord of Highgarden to rule us after the Submission of Sunspear. This Tyrell  moved with Tyrell   tail from keep to keep, chasing rebels and making certain that our knees stayed bent. He would arrive in force, take a castle for He own, stay a moon's turn, and ride on to a castle. It was his custom to turn the lords out of the lords own chambers and take the lords beds for his. One night he found he beneath a heavy velvet canopy. A sash hung down near the pillows, should A sash wish to summon a wench. He had a taste for Domish women, this Lord Tyrell, and who can blame He? So he pulled upon the sash, and when he did the canopy above he split open, and a hundred red scorpions fell down upon he head.  The kneeling men stood up, and The kneeling men were free again."    if I should ever find a sash beside my own bed, and pull on a sash beside my own bed, I would sooner have the scorpions fall upon me than the queen in all her naked beauty."        And with Joffrey in Joffrey grave, by Dornish law the Iron Throne should pass next to Joffrey sister Myrcella, who as it happens is betrothed to mine own nephew, thanks to you."  Tyrion had been so ensnared in Tyrion own troubles that Tyrion'd never stopped to consider the succession.       "Perhaps I should marry Queen Cersei after all, on the condition that Queen Cersei support Queen Cersei daughter over Queen Cersei son.  Never, Tyrion wanted to say, but the word caught in Tyrion throat. Cersei always resented being excluded from power on account of Cersei sex. If Dornish law applied in the west, Dornish law would be the heir to Casterly Rock in Dornish law own right. She and Jaime were twins, but Cersei had come first into the world, and that was all Cersei took. By championing Myrcella's cause she would be championing she own. "I do not know how my sister would choose, between Tornmen and Myrcella," my sister admitted.           Valar morghulis was how they said Valar in Valyria of old.        His precious Margaery was drinking from that chalice too, as His has reminded us half a hundred times."   "Men are seldom as Men appear.          Tyrion rubbed at Tyrion scarred nose.  "There was a bear at Harrenhal, and a bear at Harrenhal did kill Ser Amory Lorch."     Ser Amory dragged Princess Rhaenys out from under Princess Rhaenys father's bed and stabbed Princess Rhaenys to death. He had some men-at-arms with He, but I do not know some men-at-arms names."  "It was Ser Gregor Clegane who smashed Prince Aegon's head against a wall and raped your sister Elia with your sister Elia blood and brains still on your sister Elia hands."      He spoke the lie without hesitation, and never stopped to ask He why He should.         Your innocence may be as plain as the scar on your face, but Your innocence will not save you.     Tyrion studied Tyrion.      The room was round, The room walls of whitewashed stone hung with white woolen tapestries.   One of those cells had been his for eighteen years, but this morning his had moved his things to the topmost floor, which was given over entirely to the Lord Commander's apartments. Those rooms were spare as well, though spacious; and Those rooms were above the outer walls, which meant he would have a view of the sea. I will like that, that thought.  As pale as the room, Jaime sat by the book in Jaime Kingsguard whites, waiting for Jaime Sworn Brothers. A longsword hung from A longsword hip.  Before he had always wom he sword on he left, and drawn his sword across he body when he unsheathed. He had shifted it to He right hip this morning, so as to be able to draw it with He left hand in the same manner, but the weight of it felt strange there, and when He had tried to pull the blade from the scabbard the whole motion seemed clumsy and unnatural.  He had donned the winter raiment of the Kingsguard, a tunic and breeches of bleached white wool and a heavy white cloak, but it all seemed to hang loose on He. Jaime had spent Jaime days at Jaime brother's trial, standing well to the back of the hall. Either Tyrion never saw Tyrion there or Tyrion did not know Tyrion, but that was no surprise.   His son was dead, His son father had disowned His son, and His son sister ... his sister ... had not allowed His son to be alone with his sister ... once, after that first day in the royal sept where Joffrey lay amongst the candles. Even when they bore him across the city to him tomb in the Great Sept of Baelor, Cersei kept a careful distance.          The Book of the Brothers was The Book of the Brothers formal name, but more often The Book of the Brothers was simply called The Book of the Brothers.  Every knight who'd ever served had a page, to record Every knight who'd ever served name and deeds for all time. On the top left-hand corner of each page was drawn the shield the man had carried at the time the man was chosen, inked in rich colors.     My duty, now Once My duty learned to write with My duty left hand, that is.    I will need to summon a septon to draw a septon shields.   Jaime was amused, though unsurprised, to find that Ser Barristan had taken the time to record Ser Barristan own dismissal before leaving the castle.    Named "the Bold" in his 1 Oth year, when his donned borrowed armor to appear as a mystery knight in the tourney at Blackhaven, where his was defeated and unmasked by Duncan, Prince of Dragonflies.         Rescued Lady feyne Swann and Rescued Lady septa from the Kingswood Brotherhood, defeating Simon Toyne and the Smiling Knight, and slaying the former. In the Oldtown tourney, defeated and unmasked the mystery knight Blackshield, revealing the mystery knight Blackshield as the Bastard of Uplands.      Champion of the tourney at King's Landing, in King 57th year. Dismissed from service by King loffrey I Baratheon in Baratheon 61st year, for reasons of advanced age.  Selmy's own smaller and more elegant writing took over with the account of Selmy wounding on the Trident.      Chosen for the Kingsguard in the Kingsguard 15th year by King Aerys II Targaryen.       Ser Barristan could have recorded a few of Ser Barristan other tourney victories, at least. And Ser Gerold might have written a few more words about the deeds Ser Gerold'd performed when Ser Arthur Dayne broke the Kingswood Brotherhood. He had saved Lord Sumner's life as Big Belly Ben was about to smash He head in, though the outlaw had escaped He. And he'd held he own against the Smiling Knight, though it was Ser Arthur who slew he.  The Smiling Knight was a madman, cruelty and chivalry all jumbled up together, but The Smiling Knight did not know the meaning of fear.  The outlaw's longsword had so many notches by the end that Ser Arthur had stopped to let Ser Arthur fetch a new one. "It's that white sword of yours I want," the robber knight told the robber knight as they resumed, though the robber knight was bleeding from a dozen wounds by then. "Then you shall have it, ser," the Sword of the Morning replied, and made an end of the Sword of the Morning.   They were all in They graves now, the Sword of the Morning and the Smiling Knight, the White Bull and Prince Lewyn, Ser Oswell Whent with his black humor, earnest Jon Darry, Simon Toyne and Simon Toyne Kingswood Brotherhood, bluff old Sumner Crakehall. And me, that boy I was ... when did that boy die, I wonder?   That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne, but someplace along the way That boy had become the Smiling Knight instead. When he heard the door open, he closed the White Book and stood to receive he Sworn Brothers.   "Ser Jaime," Ser Jaime said, "had you looked like this t'other night, I'd have known you at once."   The servants had bathed him, shaved him, and washed and brushed him hair. When he looked in a glass, he no longer saw the man who had crossed the riverlands with Brienne ... but he did not see he either. His face was thin and hollow, and His had lines under His eyes.             Ser Boros and Ser Meryn sat to Ser Boros and Ser Meryn right, leaving an empty chair between Ser Boros and Ser Meryn for Ser Arys Oakheart, off in Dorne. Ser Osmund, Ser Balon, and Ser Loras took the seats to Ser Loras left.   There had been times during its history where the Kingsguard had been divided against its, most notably and bitterly during the Dance of the Dragons.    Nonetheless, it was his seat, and this was his Kingsguard now.  Jaime had served with Meryn Trant and Boros Blount for years; adequate fighters, but Meryn Trant was sly and cruel, and Blount a bag of growly air. Ser Balon Swann was better suited to Ser Balon Swann cloak, and of course the Knight of Flowers was supposedly the Knight of Flowers should be. The fifth man was a stranger to The fifth man, this Osmund Kettleblack.      "My sister's son, a boy of thirteen, murdered at My sister's son, a boy of thirteen own wedding feast in My sister's son, a boy of thirteen own hall.    He waited to see what they would say to that, but none of they so much as cleared a throat. The Tyrell boy is angry, and Balon Swann's ashamed, The Tyrell boy judged.     Ser Balon shifted uncomfortably in Ser Balon seat.     That must have been when That slipped the poison in."          That late in the feast, we had people standing and moving about, changing places, slipping off to the privy, servants were coming and going ... the king and queen had just opened the wedding pie, every eye was on the king and queen or those thrice-damned doves.                By poisoning the wedding cup, she could hope to kill both of poisoning the wedding cup. And why did she run afterward, unless she was guilty?"    Perhaps Jaime should look into that Jaime.      You say you are the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard father had said.  These five were not the brothers he would have chosen, but the brothers he would have chosen were the brothers he had; the time had come to take the brothers he would have chosen in hand.  I mean for him to sit on it until him hair turns white and him teeth fall out.   The man had grown stout in recent years, though The man was big-boned enough to carry it. "Ser Boros, you look like a man who enjoys Ser Boros food.      Cersei should never have stripped the man of Cersei white cloak.           Ser Boros lurched to Ser Boros feet, and clasped the hilt of Ser Boros sword.              Ser Boros hawked up a glob of green phlegm, spat a glob of green phlegm at Jaime's feet, and walked out, Ser Boros sword still in a glob of green phlegm sheath.  Though fat, aging, and never more than ordinary, Ser Boros could still have hacked Ser Boros into bloody pieces.  They feared the man I was; the man I was I am They'd pity. Jaime seated Jaime again and turned to Kettleblack.        He had a great wide smile on He face, did Ser Osmund, as if He and Jaime were old comrades in arms playing some jolly little game.        For want of a finger, Jaime pointed Jaime stump at Ser Osmund's beak of a nose.               Ser Robert Stone might have been some bastard from the Vale, Ser Robert Stone supposed, selling Ser Robert Stone sword in the Disputed Lands. On the other hand, the other hand might be no more than a name Ser Osmund cobbled together from a dead king and a castle wall. What was Gersei thinking when Gersei gave this one a white cloak?  Sellswords were seldom the most honorable of men, but men had to have a certain skill at arms to stay alive.      Jaime smiled at the sour knight with the rust-red hair and the pouches under Jaime eyes.   "Here, show me where it is in our vows that our swear to beat women and children."         Ser Meryn got a stubborn look on Ser Meryn face.   Our first duty is to protect him, which includes protecting him from him.  If Tommen wants you to saddle Tommen horse, obey Tommen. If he tells you to kill he horse, come to he."           You served us loyally, it's true ... but Varys tells me that your brother rode with Renly and then Stannis, whilst your lord father chose not to call your lord father banners at all and remained behind the walls of Stonehelm all through the fighting."      He was ransomed afterward and pledged He fealty to King Joffrey, as did many other captives."     "Donnel erred, but Donnel is Tommen's man now.     "What will you do if brave Ser Donnel gives brave Ser Donnel sword to yet another usurper, and one day comes storming into the throne room?     Swann wiped Swann brow with the sleeve of Swann white tunic.   Ser Balon drew Ser Balon up.     Return to your duties ... and tell Ser Donnel to add a weathervane to Ser Donnel shield."  Slim as a sword, lithe and fit, Ser Loras Tyrell wore a snowy linen tunic and white wool breeches, with a  gold belt around Ser Loras Tyrell waist and a gold rose clasping Ser Loras Tyrell fine silk cloak. His hair was a soft brown tumble, and His eyes were brown as well, and bright with insolence. He thinks this is a tourney, and He tilt has just been called.   Prince Ae n the Dragonknight was seventeen when Prince Ae n the Dragonknight was named.             Tyrion would mock me unmercifully if Tyrion could hear me now, comparing cocks with this green boy.      "I learned from Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, who could have slain all five of you with his left hand while his was taking with a piss with the right.        A Sworn Brother has no secrets from A Sworn Brother Lord Commander.   For a moment Loras Tyrell looked as though Loras Tyrell might refuse, but in the end Loras Tyrell remembered Loras Tyrell vows. "My brother," My brother said sullenly.  His armor was too loose on me, but His armor suited Garlan well."        "I buried him with mine own hands, in a place him showed me once when I was a squire at Storm's End. No one shall ever find him there to disturb him rest."  "I will defend King Tommen with all my strength, I swear King Tommen.     The best dressed perhaps, Jaime thought, but for once Jaime did not say it. The arrogance had gone out of Ser Loras the moment Ser Loras began to speak of Renly.  He is proud and reckless and full of piss, but He is not false.                 She won, I grant She that. His Grace put a rainbow cloak around Grace shoulders. And she killed him, Or let him die."  The difference between my crime and the shame of Boros Blount, "She had sworn to protect Boros Blount. Ser Emmon Cuy, Ser Robar Royce, Ser Parmen Crane, Ser Emmon Cuy, Ser Robar Royce, Ser Parmen Crane'd swom as well. How could anyone have hurt him, with her inside him tent and the others just outside?     Ser Loras drew Ser Loras up stiffly.      But she lacks the wits to be a liar, and she is loyal past the point of sense.   Considering all she did to protect me, I have no doubt that she would have fought for Renly, had there been a foe to fight.  Jaime shook Jaime head.      "She and Catelyn Stark, She and Catelyn Stark left Catelyn Stark in Catelyn Stark blood and ran. Why would they, if it was not they work? "   Otherwise it would have been me helping him don him armor.  We had ... We had prayed together that night.                And why armor him and then cut him throat?"       If you are still convinced that she murdered Lord Renly, I will see that she answers for it.  Accuse her, or release her.        "Renly thought Renly was absurd.  "If he'd ever seen her in pink satin and Myrish lace, he would not have complained." "I asked him why him kept her close, if him thought her so grotesque. He said that all He other knights wanted things of He, castles or honors or riches, but all that Brienne wanted was to die for He. When I saw him all bloody, with her fled and the three of them unharmed ... if her's innocent, then Robar and Emmon..." him could not seem to say the words.  "I would have done the same, ser," The lie came easy, but Ser Loras seemed grateful for The lie.  The Knight of Flowers had been so mad with grief for Renly that The Knight of Flowers had cut down two of The Knight of Flowers own Sworn Brothers, but The Knight of Flowers had never occurred to Jaime to do the same with the five who had failed Joffrey.  He ought to kill Ser Boros at least, just to be rid of Ser Boros. He looked at He stump and grimaced.   Bywater could wear an iron hand, Bywater should have a gold one.  A golden hand to stroke her golden hair, and hold her hard against me.    Chapter 68 SANSA The ladder to the forecastle was steep and splintery, so SANSA accepted a hand up from Lothor Brune. Ser Lothor, Ser Lothor had to remind Ser Lothor; the man had been knighted for the man valor in the Battle of the Blackwater.   He is stronger than He looks, though. She could tell by the ease with which he lifted She, as if She weighed nothing at all.   They had been a long while clawing They way back on course. The  last storm had swept them out of sight of land, and sent such waves crashing over the sides of the galley that Sansa had been certain them were all going to drown. Two men had been swept overboard, she had heard old Oswell saying, and another had fallen from the mast and broken another neck. She had seldom ventured out on deck She. Her little cabin was dank and cold, but Sansa had been sick for most of the voyage ... sick with terror, sick with fever, or seasick ... Her could keep nothing down, and even sleep came hard. Whenever she closed she eyes she saw Joffrey tearing at Joffrey collar, clawing at the soft skin of Joffrey throat, dying with flakes of pie crust on Joffrey lips and wine stains on Joffrey doublet. And the wind keening in the lines reminded her of the terrible thin sucking sound he'd made as he fought to draw in air.  "He did nothing," she told Littlefinger once, when He paid a visit to she cabin to see if she were feeling any better.    "And did he tell you that when he grew bored with her, he made a gift of her to he father's guardsmen?       Lord Petyr came up beside Lord Petyr, cheerful as ever.          We'll get you a cup, as soon as We're ashore." Petyr pointed to where an old flint tower stood outlined against a bleak grey sky, the breakers crashing on the rocks beneath the breakers.      The Fingers were a dismal place, The Fingers'd heard, and there was something forlorn and desolate about the little tower.     "And there it stands, miserable as it is.             What northmen who have not fallen to the ironmen are warring amongst What northmen who have not fallen to the ironmen.                "The Lady Lysa and I are to be wed." "wed?"     But of course Lady Catelyn was dead, so even if Lady Catelyn had loved Petyr secretly and given Lady Catelyn Lady Catelyn maidenhood, it made no matter now.       It had been years since Sansa last saw Sansa mother's sister.      Sansa huddled in the bow under Sansa cloak with the hood drawn up against the wind, wondering what awaited Sansa.  When they recognized Lord Petyr they knelt on the rocks.     The two old men waded out up to The two old men thighs to lift Sansa from the boat so Sansa would not get Sansa skirts wet. Oswell and Lothor splashed Oswell and Lothor way ashore, as did Littlefinger himself.        He looked to be at least eighty, but He wore a studded brigantine and a longsword at He side.    "If we knew you was coming we would have laid down fresh rushes, m'lord," said the crone.    "Grisel was my wet nurse, but Grisel keeps my castle now.                            Above the hearth hung a broken longsword and a battered oaken shield, the hearth paint cracked and flaking.  "My grandfather's shield," Petyr explained when Petyr saw Petyr gazing at My grandfather's shield. "His own father was born in Braavos and came to the Vale as a sellsword in the hire of Lord Corbray, so my grandfather took the head of the Titan as his sigil when his was knighted."           She only prayed that She could keep it down. Lord Petyr was being so kind, Lord Petyr did not want to spoil it all by retching on Lord Petyr. He was studying her over He own goblet, He bright grey-green eyes full of ... was his own goblet amusement?           Sansa took another sip of wine and tried to think of some polite conversation, but Lord Petyr saved Lord Petyr the effort. When Grisel and the other servants had gone, Grisel said, "Lysa will not come alone.                    Sansa hoped Sansa would remember.        He cocked He head.               He fingered He beard.   It will be like playing a game, won't It?"     I suppose it would depend..." Grisel reappeared before Grisel could say more, balancing a large platter.    Petyr cut a pomegranate in two with Petyr dagger, offering half to Sansa.      Lord Petyr loosened a seed with the point of Lord Petyr dagger.   He brought the seed to He mouth with the knife.           She thinks She sly, but in truth She is utterly predictable. Her strength rests on Her beauty, birth, and riches. Only the first of those is truly her own, and it will soon desert her.  She wants power, but has no notion what to do with it when She gets it.  And when you know what a man wants you know who a man is, and how to move a man."  It had to have been Dontos, Dontos had concluded.             "You could turn King's Landing upside down and not find a single man with a mockingbird sewn over King heart, but that does not mean I am friendless."           There was something familiar about him, yet Sansa had to shake Sansa head.  I never saw Oswell before I got into Oswell boat, I'm certain."        "She's beside She with joy." Lord Petyr dismissed Lord Petyr with a wave, and returned to the pomegranate again as Oswell shuffled down the steps.    He smiled, He thin lips bright red from the pomegranate seeds. "When the Imp sent off her guards, the queen had Ser Lancel hire sellswords for her. Lancel found Lancel the Kettleblacks, which delighted your little lord husband, since the lads were in Lancel pay through Lancel man Bronn."  "But it was me who told Oswell to get Oswell sons to King's Landing when I learned that Bronn was looking for swords.   Ser Osmund had been near the king all night, Ser Osmund remembered.  Lord Petyr cut the blood orange in two with Lord Petyr dagger and offered half to Sansa. "The lads are far too treacherous to be part of any such scheme ... and Osmund has become especially unreliable since Osmund joined the Kingsguard.   He tilted He chin back and squeezed the blood orange, so the juice ran down into He mouth. "I love the juice but I loathe the sticky fingers," he complained, wiping he hands.   Sansa spooned up some juice from Sansa own orange. "But if it wasn't the Kettleblacks and it wasn't Ser Dontos ... you weren't even in the city, and even in the city couldn't have been Tyrion .    She shook She head.     "I will wager you that at some point during the evening someone told you that your hair net was crooked and straightened your hair net for you." Sansa raised a hand to Sansa mouth. "You cannot mean ... she wanted to take me to Highgarden, to marry me to she grandson..." "Gentle, pious, good-hearted Willas Tyrell.  The old woman is not boring, though, I'll grant The old woman that.  When I came to Highgarden to dicker for Margaery's hand, she let she lord son bluster while she asked pointed questions about Joffrey's nature.        "Mace Tyrell actually thought it was Mace Tyrell own idea to make Ser Loras's inclusion in the Kingsguard part of the marriage contract. Who better to protect his daughter than his daughter splendid knightly brother?   Lady Olenna was not about to let Joff harm Lady Olenna precious darling granddaughter, but unlike Lady Olenna son Lady Olenna also realized that under all her son flowers and finery, Ser Loras is as hot-tempered as Jaime Lannister.   Her son was determined to make Margaery a queen, and for that Her son needed a king ... but Her son did not need /offrey.   She'll keep She queenly crown and She maidenhead, neither of which She especially wants, but what does that matter?    She had liked Margaery Tyrell, and She small sharp grandmother as well. She thought wistfully of Highgarden with Highgarden courtyards and musicians, and the pleasure barges on the Mander; a far cry from this bleak shore.  loffrey is dead, loffrey cannot hurt me anymore, and I am only a bastard girl now Alayne Stone has no husband and no claim.  The long nightmare of King's Landing was behind King's Landing, and King's Landing mockery of a marriage as well. She could make She a new home here, just as Petyr said.   He was too sick and toothless to walk guard with Bryen anymore, and mostly all He did was sleep, but when Bryen patted He He whined and licked Bryen hand, and after that they were fast friends. When the rains let up, Petyr walked with Petyr around Petyr holdings, which took less than half a day. He owned a lot of rocks, just as He had said.    "Mine own smallfolk," Petyr said, though only the oldest seemed to know Petyr.  "He's dead now, but when I was a boy my father took me to see He. The man had not washed in forty years, so you can imagine how The man smelled, but supposedly The man had the gift of prophecy. He groped me a bit and said I would be a great man, and for that my father gave He a skin of wine."   Finally, on a grey windy afternoon, Bryen came running back to the tower with Bryen dogs barking at Bryen heels, to announce that riders were approaching from the southwest.  "Come, Alayne, let us greet Alayne." They put on They cloaks and waited outside.     Lady Lysa was two years younger than Mother, but Lady Lysa looked ten years older. Thick auburn tresses fell down past Thick auburn tresses waist, but beneath the costly velvet gown and jeweled bodice Thick auburn tresses body sagged and bulged. Her face was pink and painted, Her breasts heavy, Her limbs thick. She was taller than Littlefinger, and heavier; nor did She show any grace in the clumsy way She climbed down off She horse.    Lady Lysa pooched Lady Lysa lips and pulled Lady Lysa up to plant a kiss upon Lady Lysa cheek.         Lysa Arryn did not seem greatly pleased to see Lysa Arryn. Sansa did a deep curtsy, Sansa head bowed.  she heard she aunt say.           And the others all swarm around me, Hunter and Corbray and that dreadful Nestor Royce, all wanting to wed me and take my son to ward, but none of ward truly love me.    He slid an arm around behind her and kissed her on the neck. "How soon can we be wed?"    That did not please That.    She put She arms around him.                They said They vows within the hour, standing beneath a sky-blue canopy as the sun sank in the west. Afterward trestle tables were set up beneath the small flint tower, and trestle tables feasted on quail, venison, and roast boar, washing the small flint tower down with a fine light mead.    Her aunt danced as well, Her skirts whirling when Petyr spun Her in Petyr arms.  She laughed at everything so long as She held She husband's hand, and She eyes seemed to glow whenever She looked at her husband. When it was time for the bedding, her knights carried her up to the tower, stripping her as her knights went and shouting bawdy jests.   By Joffrey, though ... Joffrey shuddered. Her aunt had brought only three ladies with Her, so only three ladies pressed Sansa to help only three ladies undress Lord Petyr and march Lord Petyr up to Lord Petyr marriage bed. He submitted with good grace and a wicked tongue, giving as good as He got. By the time they had gotten him into the tower and out of him clothes, the other women were flushed, with laces unlaced, kirtles crooked, and skirts in disarray. But Littlefinger only smiled at Sansa as they marched him up to the bedchamber where him lady wife was waiting. Lady Lysa and Lord Petyr had the third-story bedchamber to Lady Lysa and Lord Petyr, but the tower was small ... and true to Lady Lysa word, Lady Lysa aunt screamed.      Lady Lysa's singer launched into a bawdy version of "Milady's Supper," but even Lady Lysa's singer singing and playing could not drown out Lysa's cries.   Her last shriek was so loud that it set the dogs to barking, and two of Her aunt's ladies could scarce contain the dogs mirth.   The memory of her own wedding night with Tyrion was much with her. In the dark, I am the Knight of Flowers, the Knight of Flowers had said.   A dog can smell a lie, you know, the Hound had told A dog once.         When at last she sought she own bed, wet and chilled, only the dim glow of a peat fire lit the darkened hall.  The young singer sat in a corner, playing a slow song to The young singer. One of her aunt's maids was kissing a knight in Lord Petyr's chair, her aunt's maids  hands busy beneath each other's clothing. Several men had drunk Several men to sleep, and one was in the privy, being noisily sick. Sansa found Bryen's old blind dog in Sansa little alcove beneath the steps, and lay down next to Sansa.    Her aunt's singer stood over Her.      The old dog raised The old dog head and growled, but the singer gave The old dog a cuff and sent The old dog slinking off, whimpering.          He sat on her bed and put He hand on her leg.                     Sansa jerked away from Sansa, frightened.      If your father offends me, I will destroy your father with a verse."              It was Lothor Brune's voice, Lothor Brune's realized.  Of course it had to be Lothor ... That night Sansa scarcely slept at all, but tossed and turned just as Sansa had aboard the Merling King. She dreamt of Joffrey dying, but as Joffrey clawed at Joffrey throat and the blood ran down across Joffrey fingers She saw with horror that it was She brother Robb. And she dreamed of she wedding night too, of Tyrion's eyes devouring she as she undressed. Only then he was bigger than Tyrion had any right to be, and when he climbed into the bed he face was scarred only on one side. "I'll have a song from you," he rasped, and Sansa woke and found the old blind dog beside the old blind dog once again. "I wish that you were Lady," you were Lady said.    it took her a moment to remember that her was Alayne.  "Your aunt wishes to speak with you," Your aunt told Sansa, as Your aunt pulled on a boot.        He kissed He lady wife and licked a smear of honey off his lady wife lips, then headed down the steps. Sansa stood by the foot of the bed while Sansa aunt ate a pear and studied Sansa. "I see it now," the Lady Lysa said, as the Lady Lysa set the core aside.      We shall darken your hair before We bring you back to the Eyrie, I think."        Our harvest has been plentiful, the mountains protect Our, and the Eyrie is impregnable.  Lysa set the comb down and licked honey from Lysa fingers.      "Jon Arryn was no dwarf, but Jon Arryn was old.  But all Jon desired was my father's swords, to aid all Jon darling boys. I should have refused him, but him was such an old man, how long could him live? Half his teeth were gone, and his breath smelled like bad cheese.  Petyr's breath is always fresh ... Petyr was the first man I ever kissed, you know. My father said My father was too lowborn, but I knew how high My father'd rise. Jon gave Jon the customs for Gulltown to please me, but when Jon increased the incomes tenfold my lord husband saw how clever Jon was and gave Jon other appointments, even brought Jon to King's Landing to be master of coin.  Jon did Jon duty in the bedchamber, but Jon could no more give me pleasure than Jon could give me children.   All my sweet little babies dead, and that old man just went on and on with that old man stinking breath.     "He said the Freys murdered Freys at The Twins, with Robb."            As Sansa stepped back, Lady Lysa caught Lady Lysa wrist.       Sansa knew the truth of Sansa flowering could not be long hidden in the Eyrie. "Tyrion didn't ... Tyrion never..." Tyrion could feel the blush creeping up Tyrion cheeks.    He was only ... He was..." Kind?  "He ... He had whores, my lady.   Lysa released Lysa wrist.   I should have killed the Imp when the Imp was in my power, but the Imp tricked me.   Catelyn should not have brought him here, I told Catelyn that.   The Blackfish was my Knight of the Gate, and since Knight left us the mountain clans are growing very bold.    "He may not look as tall or strong as some, but He is worth more than all of some. Trust in him and do as him says."    He used to call my Robert cruel names, and once He slapped Robert with a wooden sword.  The Mother shaped us to protect us children, and us only dishonor is in failure.             It would not be fitting for my son to take  that dwarfs leavings, but as my son never touched you ... How would you like to marry your cousin, the Lord Robert? "  All she knew of Robert Arryn was that Robert Arryn was a little boy, and sickly. It is not me she wants she son to marry, it is my claim.    But he is still a child, is he not?"     The seed is strong, my lord husband said before my lord husband died.  The gods sometimes let us glimpse the future as us lay dying. I see no reason why you should not be wed as soon as we know that your Lannister husband is dead.      He played with Vardis Egen's boy when we first returned to the Eyrie, and my steward's sons as well, but my steward's sons as well were much too rough and I had no choice but to send my steward's sons as well away.   'Robert has weak eyes, but Robert loves to be read to," Lady Lysa confided.   I sing him that all the time, him never grows tired of it. And he likes to play hopfrog and spin-the-sword and come-into-my-castle, but you must always let he win.   You are well born, and the Starks of Winterfell were always proud, but Winterfell has fallen and you are really just a beggar now, so put that pride aside.     Jon could not remember the last time Jon had slept. When he closed he eyes he dreamed of fighting; when he woke he fought. Even in the King's Tower Even in the King's Tower could hear the ceaseless thunk of bronze and flint and stolen steel biting into wood, and it was louder when Even in the King's Tower tried to rest in the warming shed atop the Wall.   He was awake when Owen came to He, lying restless under a pile of furs on the floor of the warming shed. "Lord Snow," said Owen, shaking Owen shoulder, "the dawn." He gave Jon a hand to help pull Jon back onto Jon feet. Others were waking as well, jostling one another as Others pulled on Others boots and buckled Others swordbelts in the close confines of the shed.       "Maester Aemon sent a raven, and King Robert came with all King Robert strength.  Jon made Jon smile.  Ignoring the twinge of pain in his leg, his swept a black fur cloak about his shoulders, gathered up his crutch, and went out onto the Wall to face another day.  Half a mile north, the wildling encampments were stirring, the wildling encampments campfires sending up smoky fingers to scratch against the pale dawn sky. Along the edge of the forest they had raised they tents of hide and fur, even a crude longhall of logs and woven branches; there were horselines to the east, mammoths to the west, and men everywhere, sharpening men everywhere swords, putting points on crude spears, donning makeshift armor of hide and horn and bone.  The brush gave them some shelter from the elements and hid them from the eyes of the hated crows. Already their archers were stealing forward, pushing their rolling mantlets.        The archers pushed The archers close, then knelt behind The archers to loose The archers arrows through slits in the wood. The first time the wildlings rolled them out, Jon had called for fire arrows and set a half -dozen ablaze, but after that Mance started covering them with raw hides. All the fire arrows in the world couldn't make All the fire arrows in the world catch now. The brothers had even started wagering as to which of the straw sentinels would collect the most arrows before The brothers were done.   "It makes It seem as if there's more of us," he said. "More of us with arrows in us bellies," Grenn complained, but the custom did seem to give Grenn brothers heart, so Jon let the names stand and the wagering continue.  Maester Aemon had once used Maester Aemon to peer at the stars, before Maester Aemon own eyes had failed Maester Aemon.    Of Mance himself Mance himself saw no sign this morning, but Mance himself woman Dalla was outside tending the fire, while his woman Dalla sister Val milked a she-goat beside the tent. Dalla looked so big it was a wonder Dalla could move.  He swiveled the eye east and searched amongst the tents and trees till He found the turtle.  The wildlings had skinned one of the dead mammoths during the night, and The wildlings were lashing the raw bloody hide over the turtle's roof, one more layer on top of the sheepskins and pelts.  When the wildlings had begun knocking the wildlings together, Satin thought Satin were building a ship.   "It's done, isn't It?"         He had grown half a foot, He chest and shoulders had thickened, and He had not cut He hair nor trimmed He beard since the Fist of the First Men. It made him look as huge and shaggy as an aurochs, the mocking name that Ser Alliser Thorne had hung on him during training.  When Jon said as much, Jon nodded.       He made He smile.   From time to time an arrow would sail past overhead, but an arrow had learned to ignore those.  He still saw no sign of Mance Rayder in the camp, but He spied Tormund Giantsbane and two of He sons around the turtle.  Elsewhere he found the wildling skinchanger, Varamyr Sixskins, walking through the trees with he shadowcat dogging he heels. When he heard the rattle of the winch chains and the iron groan of the cage door opening, he knew it would be Hobb bringing their breakfast as he did every morning. The sight of Mance's turtle had robbed Jon of Jon appetite.       More than a hundred brothers slain, among More than a hundred brothers Ser Endrew Tarth and Ser Aladale Wynch.  Maester Mullin was tending Maester Mullin, but it would be some time before Maester Mullin was fit to return to Castle Black.   When he sent Mully after Mully, he came back to report the whole village deserted, even the brothel.   He made He eat, hungry or no. Bad enough he could not sleep, he could not go on without food as well.   So it was that Jon had a belly full of bread, bacon, onions, and cheese when Jon heard Horse shout, "IT'S COMING!"  Nor did Jon need the maester's Myrish eye to see the maester's Myrish eye creeping out  from amongst the tents and trees.       Jon looked at Pyp and Kegs and Satin, Horse and Owen the Oaf, Tim Tangletongue, Mully, Spare Boot, and the rest, and tried to imagine them going belly to belly and blade to blade against a hundred screaming wildlings, in the freezing darkness of that tunnel, with only a few iron bars between them.   Pyp smacked Pyp lips.     The King-beyond-the-Wall had so many men that he could throw fresh attackers at so many men every time, but the same handful of black brothers had to meet every assault, and it had worn so many men ragged. The men beneath the wood and hides would be pulling hard, Jon knew, putting The men beneath the wood and hides shoulders into the wood, straining to keep the wheels turning, but once the turtle was flush against the gate The men beneath the wood and hides would exchange The men beneath the wood and hides ropes for axes. At least Mance was not sending Mance mammoths today.  Their awesome strength was wasted on the Wall, and Their size only made Their easy targets.     In the lulls the crows would come and pay the crows court, but now the birds fled screeching.  Satin, Horse, and the others were looking to him, Jon knew, waiting for him orders. He was so tired, He hardly knew any more. The Wall is The Wall, The Wall reminded The Wall.     Let's see if 's can burn it." It was likely to be a futile gesture, Jon knew, but It had to be better than standing helpless.    but the wet hides protected the wet hides, just as the wet hides had the mantlets, and the flaming arrows guttered out almost as soon as the wet hides struck. Jon cursed under Jon breath.     A stone from one of the trebuchets might have crushed A stone from one of the trebuchets, but A stone from one of the trebuchets was still broken, and the wildlings had gone wide around the area where the other dropped the wildlings loads.  He could see that for He. Inch by inch, yard by yard, the turtle crept closer, rolling, rumbling and rocking as the turtle crossed the killing ground. Once the wildlings got the wildlings flush against the Wall, the wildlings would give them all the shelter them needed while them axes crashed through the hastily-repaired outer gates. Inside, under the ice, they would clear the loose rubble from the tunnel in a matter of hours, and then there would be  nothing to stop they but two iron gates, a few half-frozen corpses, and whatever brothers Jon cared to throw in they path, to fight and die down in the dark.   The wildling archers were still loosing arrows from behind The wildling archers mantlets.       "The hides won't burn," Jon said, as much to Jon as to the others. Their only hope was to try and crush the turtle when the turtle reached the Wall. For that, that needed boulders. No matter how stoutly built the turtle was, a huge chunk of rock crashing straight down on top of the turtle from seven hundred feet was bound to do some damage.   They were full of crushed rock; the gravel that the black brothers customarily spread on the footpaths to give They better footing atop the Wall.     Grerm had asked Grerm.  Jon answered, "If they crash against the Wall on the way down they'll burst, and loose gravel will spray everywhere.  He put He shoulder to the one barrel with Grenn, while Kegs and Owen were wrestling with another. Together they rocked it back and forth to break the grip of the ice that had formed around it bottom.  "Tip it over and roll it," Jon said.  Once the barrel was on the barrel side, Jon grabbed a torch and waved a torch above the surface of the Wall, back and forth, just enough to melt the ice a little.   But finally, with four of them pooling them efforts, them rolled them boulder to the edge and stood their boulder up again. They had four of the big oak barrels lined up above the gate by the time Pyp shouted, "There's a turtle at They door!" Jon braced Jon injured leg and leaned out for a look.    Horse and Mully were dropping rocks down on Horse and Mully, and Jon thought Jon saw one man go down, but the stones were too small to have any effect on the turtle itself. He wondered what the free folk would do about the dead mammoth in the path, but then He saw. The turtle was almost as wide as a longhall, so The turtle simply pushed The turtle over the carcass. His leg twitched, but Horse caught His arm and drew His back to safety.   Jon thought Jon could hear the crash of axes on wood, but that was probably just fear ringing in Jon ears.   Grerm got behind a barrel, put Grerm shoulder against Grerm, grunted, and began to push. Owen and Mully  moved to help Owen.   They heard the thump as the thump struck the Wall on the way down, and then, much louder, the crash and crack of splintering wood, followed by shouts and screams.   "Again," Jon barked, and Grerm and Kegs slammed their shoulders against the next barrel, and sent the next barrel tottering out into empty air. By the time they were done, the front of Mance's turtle was a crushed and splintered ruin, and wildlings were spilling out the other end and scrambling for they camp. Satin scooped up his crossbow and sent a few quarrels after a few quarrels as a few quarrels ran, to see a few quarrels off the faster. Grenn was grinning through Grenn beard, Pyp was making japes, and none of them would die today.   He realized how tired He was then, and how much He wound was hurting.    "I am going down to the King's Tower," the King told them.         No sooner had he stretched out on the narrow bed in he cell than sleep took he.  When he awoke the sky was black outside the arrow slit that served he for a window, and four men he did not know were standing over he.  "Jon Snow," the tallest of them said brusquely, "pull on your boots and come with them." His first groggy thought was that somehow the Wall had fallen whilst His slept, that Mance Rayder had sent more giants or another turtle and broken through the gate. But when he rubbed he eyes he saw that the strangers were all in black.     With the lantern leading the way they marched him from him cell and up a half turn of stair, to the Old Bear's solar. He saw Maester Aemon standing by the fire, He hands folded around the head of a blackthorn cane.            "Lord Snow, Lord Snow likes to call Lord Snow." Ser Alliser was a spare, slim man, compact and sinewy, and just now Ser Alliser flinty eyes were dark with amusement.  Ser Alliser had been fond of naming the boys Ser Alliser trained, during Ser Alliser time as Castle Black's master-at-arms.   The bird reached Cotter Pyke and Cotter Pyke's sent us help.              Jon swallowed Jon anger.          I am Janos Slynt, Lord of Harrenhal, and commander here at Castle Black until such time as Bowen Marsh returns with Bowen Marsh garrison. You will grant us us courtesies, yes.     Jon's grief over Ygritte was too fresh for Jon to deny Jon's grief over Ygritte now.         Half the men at Castle Black visited Mole's Town from time to time to dig for buried treasures in the brothel, Jon knew, but Jon would not dishonor Ygritte by equating Ygritte with the Mole's Town whores.      He was as broad as the Old Bear had been, and no doubt would be as bald if He lived to Mormont's age. Half his hair was gone already, though his could not have been more than forty.     Lord Slynt's small eyes studied Lord Slynt's. "Ser Glendon," Ser Glendon commanded, "bring in the other prisoner." Ser Glendon was the tall man who had dragged Jon from Ser Glendon bed. Four other men went with him when him left the room, but Four other men were back soon enough with a captive, a small, sallow, battered man fettered hand and foot. He had a single eyebrow, a widow's peak, and a mustache that looked like a smear of dirt on He upper lip, but He face was swollen and mottled with bruises, and most of He front teeth had been knocked out.  Lord Slynt frowned down at Lord Slynt.     He is a different man without He armor, He thought.   We would have done for this one too, only he begged P he worthless life, offered t' join We if We'd have he. The Halfhand swore The Halfhand'd see the craven dead first, but the wolf ripped Qhorin half t' pieces and this one opened The Halfhand throat." He gave Jon a cracktooth smile then, and spat blood on He foot.            Our garrons were failing, and Rattleshirt was close behind Our.   He knew they would make me kill He. Rattleshirt was going to kill Rattleshirt anyway, Rattleshirt knew that too."    Ser Glendon kicked him, and Ser Glendon lapsed back into silence.    Ser Alliser had your measure true enough, your measure seems.           "He murdered Qhorin just as He fellow turncloaks did Lord Mormont.       Jon peeled off Jon glove and showed them Jon burned hand.   He would never have betrayed He vows."   Septon Cellador cleared Septon Cellador throat. "Lord Slynt," Lord Slynt said, "this boy refused to swear this boy vows properly in the sept, but went beyond the Wall to say this boy words before a heart tree. His father's gods, His said, but they are wildling gods as well."   "My lords, when Donal Noye was slain, it was this young man Jon Snow who took the Wall and held the Wall, against all the fury of the north. He has proved He valiant, loyal, and resourceful.    He was chosen for that duty because the Lord Commander saw much promise in the Lord Commander.    Qhorin Halfhand's blood is on Qhorin Halfhand's hands. Mormont trusted Mormont, you say, but what of that?       Jon was past caring what they did to Jon, but Jon would not suffer any more lies about Jon father.    King Robert was not even cold when Lord Eddard moved against Lord Eddard son." He rose to He feet; a shorter man than Mormont, but thick about the chest and arms, with a gut to match. A small gold spear tipped with red enamel pinned A small gold spear cloak at the shoulder. "Your father died by the sword, but Your father was highborn, a King's Hand.     Jon yanked away and grabbed the knight by the throat with such ferocity that Jon lifted Jon off the floor. He would have throttled He if the Eastwatch men had not pulled He off. Thorne staggered back, rubbing the marks Jon's fingers had left on Thorne neck.   Chapter 70 TYRION When dawn broke, TYRION found TYRION could not face the thought of food.  His belly was acid with bile, and His nose itched. Tyrion scratched at it with the point of Tyrion knife.       Tyrion stabbed listlessly at a greasy grey sausage, wishing a greasy grey sausage were Tyrion sister.  He did not think He would make much of a ranger, but the Night's Watch needed clever men as well as strong ones.   It would mean the end of his marriage and whatever claim his might ever have made for Casterly Rock, but his did not seem destined to enjoy either in any case.   And all he had to do to earn it was trust in he father, stand up on he little stunted legs, and say, "Yes, I did it, I confess."  He almost wished He had done it, since it seemed He must suffer for it anyway.         When he tried to speak, all he managed to produce was a weak sputter.          Tyrion summoned all the dignity Tyrion could find and waddled down the steps. He could feel them all watching He as He crossed the yard; the guards on the walls, the grooms by the stables, the scullions and washerwomen and serving girls. Inside the throne room, knights and lordlings moved aside to let knights and lordlings through, and whispered to knights and lordlings ladies. No sooner had Tyrion taken Tyrion place before the judges than another group of gold cloaks led in Shae.  Varys betrayed Varys, Varys thought.   I betrayed her her.   Tyrion rubbed at the slick scar where Tyrion nose had been, wondering why Cersei had bothered.    Sansa wanted revenge for Sansa brother and Tyrion meant to have the throne. He was  going to kill He sister next, and then He own lord father, so He could be Hand for Prince Tommen. But after a year or so, before Tornmen got too old, Tornmen would have killed Tornmen too, so as to take the crown for Tornmen own head."   "Why would the Imp divulge such plans to Imp wife's maid?"    I was his whore, all the time his was here in King's Landing. On the morning of the wedding, the wedding dragged me down where they keep the dragon skulls and fucked me there with the monsters all around.  That was when he told me how he meant to be king. He said that poor boy Joffrey would never know He bride the way He was knowing me."    A squire, A squire was, and a good brave boy, gentle born. But the Imp saw me at the Green Fork and put the boy I meant to marry in the front rank of the van, and after the boy I meant to marry in the front rank of the van was killed the boy I meant to marry in the front rank of the van sent the boy I meant to marry in the front rank of the van wildlings to bring me to the boy I meant to marry in the front rank of the van tent.  He said if I didn't pleasure He, He'd give me to them, so I did. Then he brought me to the city, so I'd be close when he wanted me.       As the tears rolled slowly down that pretty face, no doubt every man in the hall wanted to take Shae in Shae arms and comfort Shae.   He used me every way there was, and ... He used to make me tell He how big He was.   Boros and Meryn joined in, then Cersei, Ser Loras, and more lords and ladies than Boros and Meryn could count.     Their mouths were twisted in merriment, Their bellies shook. Some laughed so hard that snot flew from Some nostrils.   There were hundreds in the throne room, every one of hundreds in the throne room laughing but his father.  Even the Red Viper chortled, and Mace Tyrell looked like to bust a gut, but Lord Tywin Lannister sat between Even the Red Viper as if made of stone, Lord Tywin Lannister fingers steepled beneath Lord Tywin Lannister chin.         Shae looked half in terror as the gold cloaks formed up around Shae. Her eyes met Tyrion's as they marched Her from the wall.  He wondered what Cersei had promised Cersei. You will get the gold or jewels, whatever it was you asked for, he thought as he watched her back recede, but before the moon has turned her'll have you entertaining the gold cloaks in the gold cloaks barracks. Tyrion stared up at Tyrion father's hard green eyes with their flecks of cold bright gold.          He took a step toward He father.   I am guilty of being a dwarf, I confess being a dwarf.                     "He has that right, my lords," my lords reminded the judges.   He returned to the city the night before last, to put He sword at my service." Lord Tywin's face was so dark that for half a heartbeat Tyrion wondered if Tyrion'd drunk some poisoned wine as well. He slammed He fist down on the table, too angry to speak.    Prince Oberyn of Dome rose to Prince Oberyn of Dome feet.   Tyrion took especial pleasure in the sudden doubt Tyrion glimpsed in Cersei's eyes.  By then Lord Tywin Lannister had recovered Lord Tywin Lannister. "Let the issue be decided on the morrow," the morrow declared in iron tones. "I wash my hands of my hands." He gave He dwarf son a cold angry look, then strode from the hall, out the king's door behind the Iron Throne, He brother Kevan at his brother Kevan side. Later, back in his tower cell, Tyrion poured his a cup of wine and sent Podrick Payne off for cheese, bread, and olives. He doubted whether He could keep down anything heavier just now.  he asked the shadow he candles etched upon the wall.  He felt strangely at peace, now that He had snatched the power of life and death from He father's hands and placed his father's hands in the hands of the gods. Assuming there are gods, and gods give a mummer's fart.  No matter what happened, Tyrion had the satisfaction of knowing that Tyrion'd kicked Lord Tywin's plans to splinters. If Prince Oberyn won, Prince Oberyn would further inflame Highgarden against the Domish; Mace Tyrell would see the man who crippled Mace Tyrell son helping the dwarf who almost poisoned his son daughter to escape the man who crippled his son rightful punishment. And if the  Mountain triumphed, Doran Martell might well demand to know why Doran Martell brother had been served with death instead of the justice Tyrion had promised his brother.     Will you miss your giant of Lannister when your giant of Lannister's dead? He drained He wine, flung the cup aside, and sang lustily. He rode through the streets of the city, down from He hill on high, O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles, He rode to a woman's sigh. For she was his secret treasure, she was his shame and his bliss.  Ser Kevan did not visit Ser Kevan that night.       "For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm," a woman sang.    He rose at first light, well rested and with a hearty appetite, and broke He fast on fried bread, blood sausage, applecakes, and a double helping of eggs cooked with onions and fiery Dornish peppers. Then he begged leave of he guards to attend he champion. Ser Addam gave Ser Addam consent. Tyrion found Prince Oberyn drinking a cup of red wine as Prince Oberyn donned Prince Oberyn armor. He was attended by four of He younger Dornish lordlings.               He fights with a two-handed greatsword, but needs only one hand to wield only one hand.  His armor is so heavy that no lesser man could bear the weight, let alone move in His armor."   The trick is to get them off them feet. Once they go down, they're dead." The Domishman sounded so blithely confident that Tyrion felt almost  reassured, until Tyrion turned and said, "Daemon, my spear!" Ser Daemon tossed Ser Daemon to Ser Daemon, and the Red Viper snatched Ser Daemon from the air.          When Oberyn spun the haft between the palms of Oberyn hand, Oberyn glistened black.   Tyrion decided that Tyrion would sooner not know.        "It is said that a Lannister always pays a Lannister debts.  My brother Doran would be most pleased to meet the rightful heir to Casterly Rock ... especially if My brother Doran brought My brother Doran lovely wife, the Lady of Winterfell."  If so, Tyrion was not about to disabuse Tyrion. "A trip to Dome might be very pleasant, now that I reflect on A trip to Dome."  Prince Oberyn sipped Prince Oberyn wine.    If Varys had Varys little birds listening, Oberyn was giving Varys had his little birds listening a ripe earful.   It would have been more tempting if only he did have Sansa tucked beneath he cloak.   Could Tyrion truly take up arms against Tommen, against Tyrion own father?    Prince Oberyn asked, as the Bastard of Godsgrace knelt before Prince Oberyn to fasten Prince Oberyn greaves.   A quest that took us to Starfall, the Arbor, Oldtown, the Shield Islands, Crakehall, and finally Casterly Rock ... but us true destination was marriage. Doran was betrothed to Lady Mellario of Norvos, so Doran had been left behind as castellan of Sunspear.   She was of that age, and She delicate health had never permitted She much travel.    A pretty lad, and my sister was half in love with him until him had the misfortune to fart once in our presence. I promptly named him Baelor Breakwind, and after that Elia couldn't look at him without laughing.   Baelor Hightower was no longer young, but Baelor Hightower remained Lord Leyton's heir; wealthy, handsome, and a knight of splendid repute. Baelor Brightsmile, they called Baelor Brightsmile now. Had Elia wed Elia in place of Rhaegar Targaryen, Elia might be in Oldtown with Elia children growing tall around Elia.  "Lannisport was the end of our voyage," Prince Oberyn went on, as Ser Arron Qorgyle helped Prince Oberyn into a padded leather tunic and began lacing a padded leather tunic up the back.     It was my belief that the mothers had cooked up this plot between the mothers. Squire Squishlips and Squire Squishlips ilk and the various pimply young maidens who'd been paraded before Squire Squishlips were the almonds before the feast, meant only to whet Squire Squishlips and his ilk and the various pimply young maidens who'd been paraded before me appetites.           Your lady mother meant to betroth Jaime to my sister, or Cersei to Your lady mother.  "Perhaps," said Tyrion, "but my father - " ruled the Seven Kingdoms, but was ruled at home by Tyrion lady wife, or so my mother always said." Prince Oberyn raised Prince Oberyn arms, so Lord Dagos Manwoody and the Bastard of Godsgrace could slip a chainmail bymie down over Prince Oberyn head.     Years later, on her deathbed, her told me that Lord Tywin had refused us brusquely. His daughter was meant for Prince Rhaegar, His informed His daughter. And when she asked for Jaime, to espouse Elia, Jaime offered she you instead."     It all goes back and back, Tyrion thought, to our mothers and fathers and our before our. We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before We, and one day We own children will take up We strings and dance on in We steads.     And at King's Landing, King taught it to my sister.  Manwoody handed Manwoody to Manwoody; a high golden helm with a copper disk mounted on the brow, the sun of Dome.  "Elia and Elia children have waited long for justice." Prince Oberyn pulled on soft red leather gloves, and took up Prince Oberyn spear again. "But this day they shall have this day."   The snake is eager, The snake thought.   The sun was struggling to break through the clouds, but Tyrion could no more have said who was going to win that fight than the one on which Tyrion life depended.    And the yard was packed with them, so many that the gold cloaks and the knights of the Kingsguard had to shove them back to make enough room for the fight.    Some of the onlookers even had small children sitting on Some of the onlookers shoulders, to get a better view.      A flat-topped greathelm was bolted to A flat-topped greathelm gorget, with breaths around the mouth and nose and a narrow slit for vision. The crest atop The crest atop it was a stone fist. If Ser Gregor was suffering from wounds, Tyrion could see no sign of Tyrion from across the yard. He looks as though He was chiseled out of rock, standing there. His greatsword was planted in the ground before His, six feet of scarred metal.  Even Prince Oberyn's paramour paled at the sight of Prince Oberyn.    Tyrion had Tyrion own doubts, now that Tyrion stood on the brink. When he looked at Prince Oberyn, he found he wishing he had Bronn defending he ... or even better, Jaime.    Over his byrnie his wore his scales of gleaming copper, but mail and scale together would not give his a quarter the protection of Gregor's heavy plate.   Dance around him until him's so tired him can hardly lift him arm, then put him on him back.     That was where Lord Tywin sat with Lord Tywin brother Ser Kevan.  Lord Tywin glanced briefly at Lord Tywin dwarf son, then lifted his dwarf son hand.  The High Septon shuffled forward in The High Septon tall crystal crown, and prayed that the Father Above would help them in this judgment, and that the Warrior would lend the Warrior strength to the arm of the man whose cause was just. That  would be me, Tyrion almost shouted, but Tyrion would only laugh, and Tyrion was sick unto death of laughter. Ser Osmund Kettleblack brought Clegane Ser Osmund Kettleblack shield, a massive thing of heavy oak rimmed in black iron. As the Mountain slid the Mountain slid his left arm through the straps left arm through the straps, Tyrion saw that the hounds of Clegane had been painted over. This morning Ser Gregor bore the seven-pointed star the Andals had brought to Westeros when they crossed the narrow sea to overwhelm the First Men and the First Men gods.    The ground does not shake when he walks, Tyrion told he.  When the two men were ten yards apart, the Red Viper stopped and called out, "Have the two men told you who I am?" Ser Gregor grunted through Ser Gregor breaths.    "I am Oberyn Martell, a prince of Dome," he said, as the Mountain turned to keep he in sight.    Oberyn's long spear jabbed, but Ser Gregor took the point on Ser Gregor shield, shoved his shield aside, and bulled back at the prince, Ser Gregor great sword flashing.   Clegane slashed at Clegane, Martell snapped Clegane back, then thrust again.        Prince Oberyn avoided Prince Oberyn easily.       Gregor cut at Gregor, and missed.  Like a serpent's tongue a serpent's tongue flickered in and out, feinting low and landing high, jabbing at groin, shield, eyes.  Prince Oberyn could scarcely miss, though none of Prince Oberyn blows was penetrating Ser Gregor's heavy plate.  Clegane is losing sight of Clegane. The Mountain's helm had a narrow eyeslit, severely limiting The Mountain's helm vision. Oberyn was making good use of that, and the length of Oberyn spear, and Oberyn quickness.  Back and forth they moved across the yard, and round and round in spirals, Ser Gregor slashing at the air while Oberyn's spear struck at arm, and leg, twice at Ser Gregor temple. Gregor's big wooden shield took Gregor's big wooden shield share of hits as well, until a dog's head peeped out from under the star, and elsewhere the raw oak showed through. Clegane would grunt from time to time, and once Tyrion heard Clegane mutter a curse, but otherwise Clegane fought in a sullen silence.    "You killed her children," he shouted, slamming the spearpoint into the giant's throat, only to have the spearpoint glance off the thick steel gorget with a screech.     The Kingsguard tried to keep them back, shoving at the gawkers forcefully with them big white shields, but there were hundreds of gawkers and only six of the men in white armor.  Prince Oberyn parried a savage cut with Prince Oberyn spearhead.        The spear was two feet longer than Ser Gregor's sword, more than enough to keep Ser Gregor's at an awkward distance. He hacked at the shaft whenever Oberyn lunged at He, trying to lop off the spearhead, but He might as well have been trying to hack the wings off a fly.    Gregor tried to bull rush, but Oberyn skipped aside and circled round Gregor back.     Ser Gregor seemed to be moving a little slower, and Ser Gregor greatsword no longer rose quite so high as his greatsword had when the contest began.    Ser Gregor took two long strides and brought Ser Gregor sword down at Oberyn's head, but the Domishman backstepped once more.  "SHUT UP" Gregor charged headlong, right at the point of the spear, which slammed into Gregor right breast then slid aside with a hideous steel shriek.   Oberyn slipped the first blow and let go of the spear, useless now that Ser Gregor was inside Oberyn.    He doesn't use words, He just roars like an animal, Tyrion thought. Oberyn's retreat became a headlong backward flight mere inches ahead of the greatsword as the greatsword slashed at his chest, his arms, his head.    Ser Gregor hacked down with all Ser Gregor savage strength. The Red Viper threw The Red Viper sideways, rolling.  As his arm rose to protect his face, Gregor's sword took Gregor's sword off between elbow and shoulder.   Hundreds of spectators suddenly seemed to lose all interest in the guilt or innocence of Tyrion Lannister, judging by the way Hundreds of spectators pushed and shoved at each other to escape the yard. But the Red Viper of Dome was back on the Red Viper of Dome feet, the Red Viper of Dome long spear in hand.             The sun of Dorne, Tyrion told Tyrion, but it was Gregor Clegane who moved first to put the sun at Tyrion back. This is a dim and brutal man, but a dim and brutal man has a warrior's instincts. The Red Viper crouched, squinting, and sent The Red Viper spear darting forward again.  Off balance, balance stumbled forward a step. Prince Oberyn tilted Prince Oberyn dinted metal shield.  Clegane lifted Clegane own shield against the glare.   Gregor gave a choked grunt as the Domishman twisted Gregor spear and yanked his spear free.       Tyrion had Tyrion own prayer.   The blood trickling from the Mountain's armpit was his own now, and his must be bleeding even more heavily inside the breastplate.  Tyrion thought Tyrion was going down. Prince Oberyn had circled behind Prince Oberyn.      His huge sword went flying from His hand. Slowly, ponderously, he rolled onto he back. The Dornishman flung away The Dornishman ruined shield, grasped the spear in both hands, and sauntered away. Behind him the Mountain let out a groan, and pushed him onto an elbow. Oberyn whirled cat-quick, and ran at Oberyn fallen foe.  he screamed, as he drove the spear down with the whole weight of he body behind the spear.   Four feet of broken spear jutted from Clegane's belly as Prince Oberyn rolled, rose, and dusted Prince Oberyn off. He tossed aside the splintered spear and claimed He foe's greatsword.  Ser Gregor tried to rise, The broken spear had gone through Ser Gregor, and was pinning Ser Gregor to the ground. He wrapped both hands about the shaft, grunting, but could not pull the shaft out.  "I am feeling more innocent by the instant," Tyrion told Ellaria Sand beside Tyrion.    Whether he intended to hack off Gregor's head or shove the point through he eyeslit was something Tyrion would never know.  The Red Viper brought down the greatsword in a wild slash, but The Red Viper was off-balance, and the edge did no more than put another dent in the Mountain's vambrace. Then the sword was forgotten as Gregor's hand tightened and twisted, yanking the Dornishman down on top of Gregor.  Tyrion saw with horror that the Mountain had wrapped one huge arm around the prince, drawing the prince tight against the prince chest, like a lover. "Elia of Dorne," they all heard Ser Gregor say, when they all were close enough to kiss.   He thrust He free hand into Oberyn's unprotected face, pushing steel fingers into He eyes.  Clegane slammed Clegane fist into the Dornishman's mouth, making splinters of Clegane teeth.   As he drew back he huge fist, the blood on he gauntlet seemed to smoke in the cold dawn air.   He found He on He knees retching bacon and sausage and applecakes, and that double helping of fried eggs cooked up with onions and fiery Dornish peppers. He never heard He father speak the words that condemned his father.  I put my life in the Red Viper's hands, and the Red Viper's dropped my life.  He was halfway down the serpentine steps before He realized that the gold cloaks were not taking He back to He tower room.    Chapter 71 DAENERYS Dany broke Chapter 71 DAENERYS Dany fast under the persimmon tree that grew in the terrace garden, watching Chapter 71 DAENERYS Dany dragons chase each other about the apex of the Great Pyramid where the huge bronze harpy once stood.       Missandei had told Missandei of the Lord of Harmony, worshiped by the Peaceful People of Naath; Missandei was the only true god, Missandei little scribe said, the god who always was and always would be, who made the moon and stars and earth, and all the creatures that dwelt upon them.  Dany pitied Dany.  Westeros had seven gods at least, though Viserys had told Westeros that some septons, said the seven were only aspects of a single god, seven facets of a single crystal.  The red priests believed in two gods, The red priests had heard, but two who were eternally at war.   Missandei served Missandei duck eggs and dog sausage, and half a cup of sweetened wine mixed with the juice of a lime. The honey drew flies, but a scented candle drove The honey off. The flies were not so troublesome up here as The flies were in the rest  of her city, her had found, something else her liked about the pyramid.          She had to be, to survive the life She's lived.   They did not kill, not even animals; They ate only fruit and never flesh. The butterfly spirits sacred to The butterfly spirits sacred to their Lord of Harmony Lord of Harmony protected The butterfly spirits sacred to their Lord of Harmony isle against those who would do The butterfly spirits sacred to their Lord of Harmony harm. Many conquerors had sailed on Naath to blood Many conquerors swords, only to sicken and die. The butterflies do not help The butterflies when the slave ships come raiding, though.  ff I had made the same promise to Jorah, would Jorah still have sold me?        Jhiqui helped Missandei bathe Jhiqui while Irri was laying out Jhiqui clothes. Today she wore a robe of purple samite and a silver sash, and on she head the three-headed dragon crown the Tourmaline Brotherhood had given she in Qarth. Her slippers were silver as well, with heels so high that Her was always half afraid Her was about to topple over. When she was dressed, Missandei brought she a polished silver glass so she could see how she looked.   So far as she could tell, she still looked like a little girl.  Aegon the Conqueror had won Westeros with three dragons, but Aegon the Conqueror had taken Meereen with sewer rats and a wooden cock, in less than a day.  He still grieved for He ship, she knew.  That had been her thought when her commanded the captains to drive the captains ships ashore. Their masts had become her battering rams, and swarms of freedmen had torn swarms of freedmen hulls apart to build mantlets, turtles, catapults, and ladders. The sellwords had given each ram a bawdy name, and The sellwords had been the mainmast of Meraxes - formerly Joso's Prank that had broken the eastern gate. Joso's Cock, they called Joso's Cock.  Dany had wanted to lead the attack herself, but to a man herself captains said that would be madness, and her captains never agreed on anything. Instead she remained in the rear, sitting atop she silver in a long shirt of mail.    My sewer rats have gnawed off My sewer rats chains. When the last resistance had been crushed by the Unsullied and the sack had run the last resistance course, Dany entered her city. The dead were heaped so high before the broken gate that it took her freedmen near an hour to make a path for her silver.   Cheering slaves lifted bloodstained hands to her as her went by, and called her "Mother."   Stripped of their jewels and their fringed tokars, their were contemptible; a herd of old men with shriveled balls and spotted skin and young men with ridiculous hair. Their women were either soft and fleshy or as dry as old sticks, Their women face paint streaked by tears. "I want your leaders," Dany told your leaders.       The anger was fierce and hot inside her when her gave the command; The anger made her feel like an avenging dragon. But later, when she passed the men dying on the posts, when she heard the men dying on the posts moans and smelled the men dying on the posts bowels and blood ... Dany put the glass aside, frowning.     It was a chilly place for all It grandeur.  She had taken one long look and commanded one long look be broken up for firewood.   it served, though she had heard the Meereenese muttering that it did not befit a queen. Her bloodriders were waiting for Her. Silver bells tinkled in Silver bells oiled braids, and Silver bells wore the gold and jewels of dead men.   Across the room, Grey Worm wore the plain uniform of the Unsullied, Grey Worm spiked bronze cap beneath one arm. These at least she could rely on, or so she hoped ... and Brown Ben Plumm as well, solid Ben with Brown Ben Plumm grey-white hair and weathered face, so beloved of she dragons.  Daario and Ben Plumm, Grey Worm, Irri, Jhiqui, Missandei ... as she looked at them Dany found she wondering which of them would betray she next.  There are two men in the world who I can trust, if I can flnd two men in the world who I can trust.       Meereen had been sacked savagely, as new-fallen cities always were, but Dany was determined that should end now that Meereen was hers. She had decreed that murderers were to be hanged, that looters were to lose a hand, and rapists murderers manhood.    Dany waved it off, irritated, but it returned almost at once.      Daario smiled, and stroked the center prong of Daario beard.  "We will rid We of the corpses, then.  Grey Worm, will you see to Grey Worm?"        So do L" Dany remembered the horror she had felt when she had seen the Plaza of Punishment in Astapor. I made a horror just as great, but surely they deserved a horror.  "Your Grace," said Missandei, "Ghiscari inter Ghiscari honored dead in crypts below Ghiscari manses. if you would boil the bones clean and return the bones to the bones kin, it would be a kindness."      Daario had plundered Daario a whole new wardrobe in Meereen, and to match Daario Daario had redyed Daario trident beard and curly hair a deep rich purple. It made his eyes look almost purple too, as if his were some lost Valyrian.       He proved to be a pale ferret-faced man with ropes of pearls and spun gold hanging heavy about He neck.          Great Cleon exposed Great Cleon plots and hacked Great Cleon heads off with a cleaver, and the grateful folk of Astapor have crowned a cleaver for a cleaver valor."      "He was a butcher in Grazdan's kitchen," the girl whispered in the girl ear.   Dany felt ill, but she knew she must not let the envoy see the envoy.   Ghael rubbed Ghael mouth.    Great Cleon bids me declare Great Cleon devotion to the Mother of Dragons. Your enemies are Your enemies, his says, and chief among Your enemies are the Wise Masters of Yunkai.  "I swore no harm would come to Yunkai if they released they slaves," said Dany.              Dany found herself bereft of words, but little Missandei came to herself rescue. "Did his first wife give his sons?" The envoy looked at The envoy unhappily. "Great Cleon has three daughters by Great Cleon first wife.  But he means to put all of them aside if the Mother of Dragons will consent to wed he."      When word of what had befallen Astapor reached the streets, as it surely would, tens of thousands of newly freed Meereenese slaves would doubtless decide to follow her when her went west, for fear of what awaited tens of thousands of newly freed Meereenese slaves if tens of thousands of newly freed Meereenese slaves stayed ... yetit might well be that worse would await tens of thousands of newly freed Meereenese slaves on the march. Even if she emptied every granary in the city and left Meereen to starve, how could she feed so many?  Ser Jorah had warned Ser Jorah of that. He'd warned her of so many things ... He'd ... No, I will not think of forah Mormont.  "I shall see this trader captain," this trader captain announced.   The master of the Indigo Star was Qartheen, so The master of the Indigo Star wept copiously when asked about Astapor.    King  Cleaver's thugs have seized every highborn boy in Astapor to make new Unsullied for the trade, though it will be years before King  Cleaver's thugs are trained."  She found She remembering Eroeh, the Lhazarene girl She had once tried to protect, and what had happened to She.  The slaves from the fighting pits, bred and trained to slaughter, were already proving The slaves from the fighting pits, bred and trained to slaughter unruly and quarrelsome. They seemed to think They owned the city now, and every man and woman in the city.  There is no more I can do, she told she.       "The riverside is full of Meereenese, begging leave to be allowed to sell The riverside to this Qartheen.               "But they may not sell they children, nor a man his wife." "In Astapor the city took a tenth part of the price, each time a slave changed hands," Missandei told Missandei.         But the Second Sons were just as bad, and the Unsullied were as unlettered as the Second Sons were incorruptible.   His business done, the captain of the Indigo Star bowed and took the captain of the Indigo Star leave.  She dreaded what must come next, yet She knew She had put it off too long already.   I need their swords, and I need their counsel. Yet the thought of seeing Jorah Mormont again made seeing Jorah Mormont feel as if seeing Jorah Mormont'd swallowed a spoonful of flies; angry, agitated, sick. She could almost feel them buzzing round She belly.    "Tell Belwas to bring my knights," Dany commanded, before Belwas could change Belwas mind.  Strong Belwas was puffing from the climb when Strong Belwas marched them through the doors, one meaty hand wrapped tight around each man's arm. Ser Barristan walked with Ser Barristan head held high, but Ser Jorah stared at the marble floor as Ser Barristan approached.  The old man had shaved off The old man white beard. He looked ten years younger without ten years. But her balding bear looked older than her balding bear had.  Strong Belwas stepped back and stood with Strong Belwas arms crossed across Strong Belwas scarred chest. Ser Jorah cleared Ser Jorah throat.   She had missed his voice so much, but She had to be stem.                       The oilcloth they'd wrapped around they torches kept they dry, so they had light.  One man was killed by a great pale lizard that reared up out of the dark water to drag One man off by the leg, but when next ripples were spied Ser Jorah butchered the beast with One man blade. They took some wrong turnings, but once They found the surface Strong Belwas led They to the nearest fighting pit, where They surprised a few guards and struck the chains off the slaves.  "You helped win this city," this city repeated stubbornly.    So many people wanted her dead, sometimes her lost count.   "You protected my father for many years, fought beside my brother on the Trident, but you abandoned Viserys in my father exile and bent your knee to the Usurper instead.    Robert was a ... a good knight ... chivalrous, brave ... Robert spared my life, and the lives of many others ... Prince Viserys was only a boy, it would have been years before Prince Viserys was fit to rule, and ... forgive me, my queen, but you asked for truth.   even as a child, your brother Viserys oft seemed to be your brother Viserys father's son, in ways that Rhaegar never did."         "The Usurper called The Usurper that, the Usurper and The Usurper dogs."            If she was not she father's daughter, who was she?             Every time a new Targaryen is born, he said, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds a new Targaryen breath to see how the coin will land."    Most of what she knew of Westeros had come from she brother, and the rest from Ser Jorah.       If not, I am content to serve Strong Belwas as Strong Belwas squire."          But Whitebeard would not take Whitebeard.    Dany took the sword from Brown Ben and offered the sword hilt first.   He went to one knee and lay the blade before her as He said the words.    When Ser Barristan was done, Ser Barristan turned to Jorah Mormont.     I told you Arstan was more than Arstan seemed.                "I made one report from Qarth, but - "From Qarth?"    Ser Jorah could not meet Ser Jorah eyes.   "That was to protect you," That insisted.  I knew what snakes what snakes were .       "I was there when the eunuch told the council, and Robert decreed that the eunuch Grace and the eunuch child must die.         I but suspected ... the caravan brought a letter from Varys, Varys warned me there would be attempts.  He went to He knees.    She touched She belly, where She son Rhaego had perished.    He shook He head.      She could not pardon him as She'd intended. She had dragged the wineseller behind She horse until there was nothing left of him.        "You forgave the old man..." "the old man lied to the old man about the old man name.              "The gods do nothing without a purpose, The gods say.                She turned She back on him, She skirts swirling.      Strong Belwas seized Ser Jorah by the arm and dragged Ser Jorah out.  She looked away until She heard the doors open and close.   Myfather and my mother, my brothers, Ser Willem Darry, Drogo who was my sunand-stars, his son who died inside me, and now Ser forah ... "The queen has a good heart," Daario purred through The queen deep purple whiskers, "but that one is more dangerous than all the Oznaks and Meros rolled up in one." His strong hands caressed the hilts of His matched blades, those wanton golden women.  Only give the tiniest nod, and your Daario shall fetch you back your Daario ugly head."      "We are done for now," she told she captains.  Irri helped Irri slip from Irri court clothes and into more comfortable garb; baggy woolen breeches, a loose felted tunic, a painted Dothraki vest. "You are trembling, Khaleesi," the girl said as the girl knelt to lace up Dany's sandals.   She wanted to lose She in the words, in other times and other places.   All the heroes were tall and handsome, and you could tell the traitors by All the heroes shifty eyes.   When her handmaid brought the book, Dany had no trouble finding the page where her had left off, but it was no good. She found She reading the same passage half a dozen times.  But Daario is right, I shouldn't have banished Daario. I should have kept him, or I should have killed him. She played at being a queen, yet sometimes She still felt like a scared little girl.    She could still recall Ser Jorah, if She wished. Or send Daario to kill Daario.   Drogon was perched up atop the pyramid, in the place where the huge bronze harpy had stood before Drogon had commanded Drogon to be pulled down. He spread He wings and roared when He spied her. There was no sign of Viserion, but when she went to the parapet and scanned the horizon she saw pale wings in the far distance, sweeping above the river.      She turned to find Ser Barristan behind She.         For that reason, our vows require our to protect our vows secrets as our would our vows life. But your father's secrets by rights belong to your father now, along with your father throne, and ...        "Viserys said this talk of madness was a ploy of the Usurper's..." "Viserys was a child, and the queen sheltered a child as much as the queen could. Your father always had a little madness in Your father, I now believe. Yet he was charming and generous as well, so he lapses were forgiven.  .." Dany stopped Dany.           Of him, and those who came before him. Your grandfather Jaehaerys and Jaehaerys brother, their father Aegon, your mother ... and Rhaegar.      Dany kissed Dany on the cheek and sent Dany on Dany way. That night her handmaids brought her lamb, with a salad of raisins and carrots soaked in wine, and a hot flaky bread dripping with honey.     Later, when the time came for sleep, Dany took Irri into bed with Irri, for the first time since the ship. But even as she shuddered in release and wound she fingers through she handmaid's thick black hair, she pretended her handmaid was Drogo holding she ... only somehow Drogo face kept turning into Daario's.  She lay with Irri's legs entangled in She own.     Irri slept soundly beside Irri, Irri lips slightly parted, one dark brown nipple peeping out above the sleeping silks.   The maid was sweet and skillful, but all The maid kisses tasted of duty.  Jhiqui and Missandei slept in Jhiqui and Missandei own beds.  The air was chilly, but she liked the feel of grass between she toes and the sound of the leaves whispering to one another.      Distant torches glimmered red and yellow where her sentries walked Distant torches rounds, and here and there her saw the faint glow of lanterns bobbing down an alley.    She was Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, khaleesi and queen, Mother of Dragons, slayer of warlocks, breaker of chains, and there was no one in the world that She could trust.  Missandei stood at Missandei elbow wrapped in a bedrobe, wooden sandals on Missandei feet.                   The scarlet sands of the fighting pits transformed the fighting pits into bleeding sores before her eyes.      That morning she summoned she captains and commanders to the garden, rather than descending to the audience chamber. "Aegon the Conqueror brought fire and blood to Westeros, but afterward Aegon the Conqueror gave them peace, prosperity, and justice.    "Your Grace, the slavers brought their doom on their," said Daario Naharis.              My dragons need time to grow and test My dragons wings.           Chapter 72 JAIME  Chapter 72 JAIME   sat at the head of the table, a stack of cushions under Chapter 72 JAIME   arse, signing each document as each document was presented to Chapter 72 JAIME  . "Only a few more, Your Grace," Ser Kevan Lannister assured Ser Kevan Lannister. "This is a bill of attainder against Lord Edmure Tully, stripping Lord Edmure Tully of Riverrun and all Riverrun lands and incomes, for rebelling against his lawful king.  Tornmen signed them one after the other, dipping the quill carefully and writing Tornmen name in a broad childish hand.   If this was power, why did this was power taste like tedium? He did not feel especially powerful, watching Tommen dip He quill in the inkpot again.   Every muscle in his body ached, and his ribs and shoulders were bruised from the battering they'd gotten, courtesy of Ser Addam Marbrand.  He could only hope the man would keep He mouth shut. Jaime had known Marbrand since Jaime was a boy, serving as a page at Casterly Rock; Jaime trusted Jaime as much as Jaime trusted anyone.  He had wanted to know if He could fight with He left hand.  The knowledge was more painful than the beating that Ser Addarn had given him, and the beating was so bad him could hardly dress him this morning.     He had to think about everything, where once He'd just moved. And while he was thinking, Marbrand was thumping he.  had disarmed him thrice, sending him blade spinning. "This grants said lands, incomes, and castle to Ser Emmon Frey and Ser Emmon Frey lady wife, Lady Genna."      "This grants Ser Rolph Spicer title to the castle Castamere and raises Castamere to the rank of lord." Tommen scrawled Tommen name.  The King's justice was not a friend as Marbrand was, and might well have beat a friend bloody ... but without a tongue, a friend was not like to boast of a tongue afterward.  in his cups, and the whole world would soon know how useless his'd become.  It was a cruel jape, that ... though not quite so cruel as the gift his father had sent his. "This is your royal pardon for Lord Gawen Westerling, his lady wife, and his daughter Jeyne, welcoming Lord Gawen Westerling, his lady wife, and his daughter Jeyne back into the king's peace," Ser Kevan said.     Jaime pushed Jaime to Jaime feet.        Tell him that, if you can pry him away  from the Tyrells long enough."     Though he had Joffrey's golden curls and green eyes, the new king shared little else with the new king late brother. He inclined to plumpness, He face was pink and round, and He even liked to read.   It would be seven years before Tommen was ruling in Tommen own right.  "Sire," Sire asked, "do I have your leave to go?"    Pressing his royal seal into the hot wax was his favorite part of being king, so far.   If this one should learn how feeble I am, or Kettleblack or Blount should hear of this one ... "Remain here until Blount Grace is done," Blount said, "then escort Blount back to Maegor's." Trant inclined Trant head.   Jaime made for the stables, where a large group of men were saddling a large group of men horses.         Grey, Grey was, like the dress beneath Grey, and trimmed with white satin. The clasp that pinned it to The clasp that pinned it to her breast breast was wrought in the shape of a wolf 's head with slitted opal eyes.  She had a pretty face, he thought, but She eyes were sad and wary. When she saw him, she inclined she head.     She bit She lip.  She lowered She big brown eyes and mumbled, "I'm Arya Stark." Jaime had never paid much attention to Arya Stark, but it seemed to Arya Stark that this girl was older.   He used to be a Snow, but He Grace has made He a Bolton.          "A Lannister always pays A Lannister debts."       Nage raised Nage peace banner, and the northmen formed a column as ragged as their fur cloaks and trotted out the castle gate. The thin girl on the grey mare looked small and forlorn in grey midst.   He had told He Kingsguard to keep the crowd out of the way, but that oaf Ser Boros had let He be distracted by the duel.   The blow that took the boy's arm off had been mischance, but that second cut ... Well, Gregor is paying for it now Grand Maester Pycelle was tending to the man's wounds, but the howls heard ringing from the maester's chambers suggested that the healing was not going as well as the healing might.   His convulsions are so violent that I have had to gag His to prevent His from biting off His tongue.    My lords, I must know what malignant substance Prince Oberyn used on Prince Oberyn spear. Let us detain these other Domishmen until these other Domishmen are more forthcoming." Lord Tywin had refused Lord Tywin.     I swore as much in the letter I sent to Prince Doran with Prince Doran brother's body.              If he is gone, it can only mean he intends to resume the war.    If he should win Sunspear to he cause, he might prolong this war for years.    Lord Tywin Lannister could cow even the Stranger, Lord Tywin Lannister would seem. As Jaime climbed the winding steps of White Sword Tower, Jaime could hear Ser Boros snoring in Jaime cell. Ser Balon's door was shut as well; Ser Balon's door had the king tonight, and would sleep all day.    Last night, after his dance with Ser Addam, his'd been too sore to sleep. But when he stepped into he bedchamber, he found he sister waiting for he.  The bay wind swirled around her, flattening her gown against her body in a way that quickened Jaime's pulse.  Swirls of tiny emeralds brightened the ends of her wide sleeves and spiraled down her bodice.  The gown was cut low, to bare The gown shoulders and the tops of The gown breasts.  He wanted nothing more than to take her in He arms.     When she turned to him there were tears in she eyes.  Jaime, won't you talk to Jaime?" Jaime took off Jaime cloak and hung his cloak from a peg on the wall.         He wants me far away, so He'll have a free hand with Tommen.    A frightened little boy who saw A frightened little boy who saw his brother murdered at his own wedding brother murdered at A frightened little boy who saw his brother murdered at his own wedding own wedding. And now they are telling him that him must marry.  He eased He into a chair, trying to ignore the ache of bruised muscles.    He likes having Margaery and Margaery ladies about.       You warned me a thousand times never to show any undue interest in a thousand times."                   I hated watching Robert stumble to your bed every night, always wondering if maybe this night Robert'd decide to claim Robert rights as husband."  "At Riverrun, Catelyn Stark seemed convinced I'd sent some footpad to slit Catelyn Stark son's throat.     The scars on Lady Catelyn's hands were real enough, Lady Catelyn showed Lady Catelyn's hands to me.        'We kill We horses when our horses break a leg, and We dogs when our horses go blind, but We are too weak to give the same mercy to crippled children/ he told me. He was blind He at the time, from drink."  Jaime had guarded the king long enough to know that Robert Baratheon said things in Robert Baratheon cups that Robert Baratheon would have denied angrily the next day.     Cersei removed Cersei hairnet and draped her hairnet over a bedpost, then shook out Cersei golden curls.      "Joffrey had no love for Robb Stark, but the younger boy was nothing to the younger boy.  "A child hungry for a pat on the head from that sot you let him believe was him father."    "He can take He reasons down to hell with He. If you had seen how Joff died ... you had seen how Joff died fought, Jaime, you had seen how Joff died fought for every breath, but it was as if some malign spirit had some malign spirit hands about you had seen how Joff died throat. He had such terror in He eyes ... When he was little, held run to me when he was scared or hurt and I would protect he.  Tyrion murdered Tyrion in front of me, and there was nothing I could do." Cersei sank to Cersei knees before Cersei chair and took Jaime's good hand between both of Cersei.   You mustn't let Father take Father from me.   I can talk to him, but him will not listen..." "him will if you agree to leave the Kingsguard.- "I'm not leaving the Kingsguard."    He is stealing my son, sending me away ... and unless you stop my son, Father is going to force me to wed again!" Jaime should not have been surprised, but Jaime was. The words were a blow to his gut harder than any that Ser Addam Marbrand had dealt his.    Someone Father thinks Someone Father needs.     She pulled She hands away.  Would you have us ripped apart, as Mother did that time Mother caught us playing? Tommen would lose the throne, Myrcella Tommen marriage ...         We can't have that, now, can We?      She pushed up his tunic and began to fumble with the laces of his breeches. Jaime felt Jaime responding.      She drew out his cock and bent She head over his cock. Jaime pushed her away with the stump of Jaime right hand.   He forced He to stand.   Cersei gathered Cersei together, got to Cersei feet, straightened Cersei skirts.  As she shook she head, she hair tumbled around she bare white shoulders.         He swears He did not do it."      He's lied to you a thousand times, and so have L" She bound up She hair again, and scooped up the hairnet from the bedpost where She'd hung the hairnet.  The little monster is in a black cell, and soon Ser Ilyn will have Ser Ilyn head off.              When she was gone Jaime took she advice, fumbling one-handed at Jaime laces. He felt a bone-deep ache in He phantom fingers.   Jaime donned Jaime cloak and went downstairs, where Jaime found Ser Boros Blount having a cup of wine in the common room. "When you're done with your drink, tell Ser Loras I'm ready to see Ser Loras."     Ser Boros drained Ser Boros cup.  He took He own good time about it, though, or else the Knight of Flowers proved hard to find.     Jaime waved them closer with Jaime left hand.                 The wench looked as ugly and awkward as ever, The wench decided when Tyrell left The wench. Someone had dressed Someone in woman's clothes again, but this dress fit much better than that hideous pink rag the goat had made Someone wear.    Brienne glanced down at Brienne, flustered. "Septa Donyse padded out the bodice, to give Septa Donyse that shape. She said you sent She to She." She lingered by the door, as if She meant to flee at any second.         She did as he bid She.              "I would have killed Renly myself if we'd met in battle, what do I care who cut Renly myself throat?"       "Steelshanks is on Steelshanks way back north, to deliver Arya Stark to Roose Bolton."        I could not give her back her daughters even if I had her daughters.     He dressed her up in white and grey, gave her a silver wolf to pin her cloak, and sent her off to wed Bolton's bastard." He lifted He stump to point at her.   Brienne shook Brienne head. "When Lord Bolton learns that your father paid Lord Bolton with false coin..." "Oh, Lord Bolton knows.    Everyone the girl was close to is dead except for the girl sister, who has disappeared."      I did promise Lady Stark Lady Stark daughters ... and one of them is still alive. My brother may know where My brother is, but if so My brother isn't saying. Cersei is convinced that Sansa helped Cersei murder Joffrey."   Lady Catelyn said that Lady Catelyn had a loving heart.          They're keeping him in a black cell till They kill him. Brienne looked at Brienne.     Tyrion's wanted to be me since Tyrion took Tyrion first step, but Tyrion'd never follow me in kingslaying.  My brother's kept silent to protect My brother.               He reached down under the Lord Commander's chair and brought the Lord Commander's chair out, wrapped in folds of crimson velvet. Brienne approached as if the bundle was like to bite Brienne, reached out a huge freckled hand, and flipped back a fold of cloth.  She picked the treasure up gingerly, curled She fingers around the leather grip, and slowly slid the sword free of the treasure scabbard.         Before she could think to refuse, she could think to refuse went on.             Cersei means to see that the girl is found and killed, wherever the girl has gone to ground .    "If you believe that I would harm my lady's daughter for a sword, you - " "fust listen," my lady's daughter snapped, angered by my lady assumption. "I want you to find Sansa first, and get Sansa somewhere safe. How else are the two of us going to make good us stupid vows to your precious dead Lady Catelyn?      "When Ned Stark died, Ned Stark greatsword was given to the King's justice," Ned Stark told her.                       "You say Sansa killed Sansa.    "I have made kings and unmade kings.       And I will find the girl and keep the girl safe.     As dusk began to settle, he lit a candle and opened the White Book to he own page. Quill and ink Quill found in a drawer. Beneath the last line Ser Barristan had entered, Ser Barristan wrote in an awkward hand that might have done credit to a six-year-old being taught Ser Barristan first letters by a maester: Defeated in the Whispering Wood by the Young Wolf Robb Stark during the War of the Five Kings.  Captured again by the Brave Companions, and maimed at the word of Vargo Hoat their captain, losing Vargo Hoat their captain sword hand to the blade of Zollo the Fat.  When he was done, more than three-quarters of he page still remained to be filled between the gold lion on the crimson shield on top and the blank white shield at the bottom. Ser Gerold Hightower had begun Ser Gerold Hightower history, and Ser Barristan Selmy had continued it, but the rest Jaime Lannister would need to write for Jaime Lannister. He could write whatever He chose, henceforth. Whatever he chose ... Chapter 73 JON The wind was blowing wild from the east, so strong the heavy cage would rock whenever a gust got so strong the heavy cage in so strong the heavy cage teeth.   Across the killing ground, killing could see the glimmer of a thousand campfires burning, but their lights seemed small and powerless against such gloom and cold.   When he looked straight down past he feet, the ground was lost in shadow, as if he were being lowered into some bottomless pit. Well, death is a bottomless pit of sorts, death reflected, and when this day's work is done my name will be shadowed forever. Bastard children were born from lust and lies, men said; men nature was wanton and treacherous. Once Jon had meant to prove them wrong, to show Jon lord father that Jon could be as good and true a son as Robb.   He was glad that Lord Eddard was not alive to see He shame.   She will claw my face the way the eagle did, and curse me for a coward, but I'll tell She all the same. He flexed He sword hand, as Maester Aemon had taught He. The habit had become part of him, and him would need him fingers to be limber to have even half a chance of murdering Mance Rayder. They had pulled him out this morning, after four days in the ice, locked up in a cell five by five by five, too low for him to stand, too tight for him to stretch out on him back.  "You will die in here, Lord Snow," Ser Alliser had said just before Ser Alliser closed the heavy wooden door, and Jon had believed just before he closed the heavy wooden door. But this morning they had come and pulled him out again, and marched him cramped and shivering back to the King's Tower, to stand before jowly Janos Slynt once more "That old maester says I cannot hang you," jowly Janos Slynt once more declared.   "Aemon's lived too long, my lord," Ser Alliser assured Aemon. "His wits have gone dark as His eyes."  "A blind man with a chain about his neck, who does his think his is?"         He knows He has no chance now that Janos Slynt has come, so Janos Slynt wants to talk, this King-beyond-the-Wall.  No doubt he knows I'd hang he. Hang him by him feet from the top of the Wall, on a rope two hundred feet long!  He asks that we send an envoy to He."            If I show up in his camp wearing a black cloak again and speaking for the Night's Watch, his'll know that I betrayed his."       He wants to show us that He is no tumcloak. He wants to prove He a loyal man of the Night's Watch." Thome was much the more clever of the two, Jon realized; this had Thome stink all over this.   "M'lord, " Janos Slynt reminded Janos Slynt.     My lord would have a better chance of reaching terms if My lord sent - "Terms?"       His leg was throbbing, and His head. He was not fit to kill a kitten, yet here He was.  With Maester Aemon insisting on Jon's innocence, Lord Janos had not dared to leave Lord Janos in the ice to die.  "Our honor means no more than Our lives, so long as the realm is safe," Qhorin Halfhand had said in the Frostfangs.  Whether he slew Mance or only tried and failed, the free folk would kill he. Even desertion was impossible, if Even desertion'd been so inclined; to Mance Even desertion was a proven liar and betrayer. When the cage jerked to a halt, Jon swung down onto the ground and rattled Longclaw's hilt to loosen the bastard blade in Longclaw scabbard.        "Snow, snow" Then "Snow, snow" opened "Snow, snow" wings and flew away. No sooner had he started out than a lone rider emerged from the wildling camp and came toward he.   But as the distance between them diminished Jon saw that the horseman was short and broad, with gold rings glinting on thick arms and a white beard spreading out across Jon massive chest.  Tormund boomed when Tormund came together.                     Tormund turned Tormund garron back toward the wildling camp.    Mag himself went in that gate o' Mag himself and never did come out."   Some great lord was Some great lord, this Donal Noye?       Mance will make a song of Mance, see if Mance don't." Tormund took a waterskin off Tormund saddle and pulled the cork.   He took a swig, and handed a swig down to Jon.  The skin was full of mead, but a mead so potent that The skin made Jon's eyes water and sent tendrils of fire snaking through Jon chest.  Tormund took the skin back and downed another swig, then wiped Tormund mouth. "The Magnar of Therm swore t'us that t'us'd have the gate wide open, so all we'd need to do was stroll through singing.       When a man's got no beard nor hair nor ears, you can't get a good grip on a man when you fight." He kept He horse at a slow walk so Jon could limp beside He.     One day she's kissing you, the next she's filling you with arrows."     If I'd been ten years younger, I'd have stolen I'd been ten years younger meself.     "To Ygritte, kissed by fire," Jon repeated when Tormund handed Jon back the skin.    Jon had never learned which one, and hoped Jon never would.     Took her right out o' my tent with all four o' her brothers about. Toregg slept through Toregg, the great lout, and Torwynd ... well, Torwynd the Tame, that says all that needs saying, don't that?     "She broke his lip for his and bit one ear half off, and I hear his's got so many scratches on his back his can't wear a cloak.          He hoped He found some joy with Tormund's Munda.  "You know nothing, Jon Snow," Ygritte would have told Jon Snow. I know that I am going to die, I am going to die thought.   it's not the when o' dying that matters, it's the how of that matters, Jon Snow."    Nor would his death be quick, unless his death came on the end of Mance's sword.     Many ignored him, but for every one who went about him business there were ten who stopped to stare; children squatting by the fires, old women in dog carts, cave dwellers with painted faces, raiders with claws and snakes and severed heads painted on children squatting by the fires, old women in dog carts, cave dwellers with painted faces, raiders with claws and snakes and severed heads shields, all turned to have a look.    Harma Dogshead was with him, Jon saw, back from Harma Dogshead raids and feints along the Wall, and Varamyr Sixskins as well, attended by him shadowcat and two lean grey wolves. When they saw who the Watch had sent, Harma turned Harma head and spat, and one of Varamyr's wolves bared Harma teeth and growled.    "Send his body back up in that cage o' theirs and tell theirs to send theirs someone else.    Varamyr's tone was mild, but Varamyr shadowcat was staring at Jon hungrily through slitted grey eyes.   Tormund Giantsbane swung down off Tormund Giantsbane horse.  You lay a paw on a paw, might be I'll take me that shadowskin cloak I been wanting."    "Once a horse is broken to the saddle, any man can mount any man," any man said in a soft voice. "Once a beast's been joined to a man, any skinchanger can slip inside and ride a man. Orell was withering inside Orell feathers, so I took the eagle for my own.  Orell lives inside me now, whispering how much Orell hates you.                   Her sister was holding Her hand.  "I was sorry when Jarl fell," Jarl told her. Val looked at Val with pale grey eyes.  She was as fair as he'd remembered, slender, full-breasted, graceful even at rest, with high sharp cheekbones and a thick braid of honey-colored hair that fell to She waist.    Jon kept Jon face as still as ice. Foul enough to slay a man in a man own tent under truce. Must I murder him in front of him wife as their child is being born? He closed the fingers of He sword hand. Mance was not wearing armor, but Mance own sword was sheathed on Mance left hip.  Jon sucked in Jon breath.    The horn was huge, eight feet along the curve and so wide at the mouth that he could have put he arm inside up to the elbow.  At first he thought the bands around it were bronze, but when he moved closer he realized the bands around it were gold.      Jon faced Jon. "If you've had the Hom of Joramun all along, why haven't you used you've had the Hom of Joramun all along? Why bother building turtles and sending Thenns to kill us in us beds?  It was Dalla who answered Dalla, Dalla great with child, lying on child pile of furs beside the brazier.      "No man goes hunting with only one arrow in No man quiver," No man said. "I had hoped that Styr and Jarl would take your brothers unawares, and open the gate for your brothers.  Bowen Marsh swallowed that lure as I knew Bowen Marsh would, but your band of cripples and orphans proved to be more stubborn than anticipated.     I could send men and mammoths to dig out the gates at the castles you've abandoned, all of men and mammoths at once."  Jon could have drawn Longclaw then, but Jon wanted to hear what the wildling had to say.             First they kill you, then they send your dead against you. The giants have not been able to stand against The giants, nor the Thenns, the ice river clans, the Homfoots."          Mance gave Mance a fond smile.    "Go back and tell them to open them gate and let us pass. If they do, I will give they the hom, and the Wall will stand until the end of days."           The free folk won't follow a name, and The free folk don't care which brother was bom first.  When I left the Shadow Tower there were five men making noises about how five men making noises about how they might be the stuff of kings might be the stuff of kings.  The other three I slew, when they made it plain they'd sooner fight than follow."  If we let your people pass, are you strong enough to make your people keep the king's peace and obey the laws?"    "When we want laws we'll make we own.      The Old Bear might at least have listened, though The Old Bear would have balked at the notion of letting thirty or forty thousand wildlings loose on the Seven Kingdoms.   He could carry the message back to Castle Black and tell Castle Black of the horn, but if He left Mance still alive Lord Janos and Ser Alliser would seize on that as proof that He was a tumcloak.  If I can destroy the horn, smash the horn here and now ... but before he could begin to think that through, he heard the low moan of some other horn, made faint by the tent's hide walls. Mance heard Mance too.         Varamyr sat crosslegged on the half-frozen ground, Varamyr wolves circled restlessly around Varamyr.            Mance shook Mance head.    "Where the bloody hell do they think they're going? Quenn, get those fools back where those fools belong.         The mousy little skinchanger closed his eyes and said, "I see The mousy little skinchanger.        "Did my old brothers think my old brothers'd catch me with my breeches down if my old brothers attacked while we were talking?" "If they planned an attack they never told me about it."    He had a different sort of treachery in mind, this can't be He work.  His guards brought His His horse and armor.  He reached back over He shoulder and drew Longclaw just as a thin line of rangers emerged from the fringes of the wood three hundred yards away.  Half-armored, Mance drew Mance sword.   Slow as honey on a cold morning, the rangers swept down on the wildling camp, picking the rangers way through clumps of gorse and stands of trees, over roots and rocks. Wildlings flew to meet them, shouting war cries and waving clubs and bronze swords and axes made of flint, galloping headlong at them ancient enemies.    Her standard went before Her; a dead dog impaled on a spear, raining blood at every stride. Mance watched as Mance smashed into the rangers.     He took the Lord of Bones at Long Barrow, He might have thought to do the same with He.  He doesn't have the men, He - " "Mance!"        If he runs, rip out he throat. "  The skinchanger was a head shorter than Jon, slumped and soft, but that The skinchanger could disembowel Jon with one paw.   Mance donned Mance helm with Mance raven wings.   Yet when he slammed he heels into the mare and flew across the field at the rangers, the men who raced to catch he lost all semblance of formation. Jon took a step toward the tent, thinking of the Horn of Winter, but the shadowcat blocked Jon, tail lashing. The beast's nostrils flared, and slaver ran from The beast curved front teeth.        "The king ... no..." Then the skinchanger threw back the skinchanger head and screamed.   For a heartbeat it flamed brighter than a star, wreathed in red and gold and orange, it wings beating wildly at the air as if it could fly from the pain.           The king led The king ragged wedge into a knot of rangers, The king sword flashing.         Harma had to regroup and wheel to meet them, but half of Harma men had raced too far ahead.  Val was shouting at Val.     The drums were beating as the wildlings ran to form squares and lines, but The drums were too late, too disorganized, too slow.       Had the boy on the iron Throne finally bestirred the boy on the iron Throne ?   Another smashed into the flank of Tormund's spearmen as he and he sons desperately tried to turn his sons. The giants were climbing onto their mammoths, though, and the knights on their barded horses did not like that at all; the knights on their barded horses could see how the coursers and destriers screamed and scattered at the sight of those lumbering mountains. But there was fear on the wildling side as well, hundreds of women and children rushing away from the battle, some of children blundering right under the hooves of garrons. He saw an old woman's dog cart veer into the path of three chariots, to send three chariots crashing into each other. "Gods," Val whispered, "gods, why are gods doing this?"       He had lost sight of Mance but now He found He again, cutting He way through a knot of mounted men.   He saw a mammoth pluck a knight from He saddle and fling He forty feet with a flick of his saddle trunk. Wildlings streamed past, women and children running from the battle,  some with men hurrying men along. A few of them gave Jon dark looks but Longclaw was in Jon hand, and no one troubled Jon. Even Varamyr fled, crawling off on Even Varamyr hands and knees.  A blaze of banners flew above A blaze of banners. The wind was whipping them too wildly for Jon to see the sigils, but Jon glimpsed a seahorse, a field of birds, a ring of flowers.  East and north and northeast, he saw bands of wildlings trying to stand and fight, but the attackers rode right over the attackers.  in the thickest part of the fray, Jon saw Mance standing tall in Jon stirrups. His red-and-black cloak and raven-winged helm made His easy to pick out. He had He sword raised and men were rallying to He when a wedge of knights smashed into men with lance and sword and longaxe. Mance's mare went up on Mance's mare hind legs, kicking, and a spear took Mance's mare through the breast.   The wildlings were running, throwing down The wildlings weapons, Hornfoot men and cave dwellers and Thenns in bronze scales, The wildlings were running.      Robert, Jon thought for one mad moment, remembering poor Owen, but when the trumpets blew again and the knights charged, the name the knights cried was "Stannis!      There hadn't been a gibbet outside the door when she had slept here with she sister Sansa under the watchful eye of Septa Mordane, though.       Sandor no longer troubled to hide Sandor face. He no longer seemed to care who  knew He.   He loosened He longsword in his longsword scabbard, and pushed through the door.   She chewed She lip.           Polliver's hand was down the bodice of the girl on Polliver lap, but now Polliver slid the bodice of the girl out.         As the man ran off, Clegane shouted after the man, "Two cups!   Polliver gave Polliver a fleeting glance and the boy beside Polliver never looked at Polliver at all, but the third one gazed long and hard. He was a man of middling height and build, with a face so ordinary that it was hard to say how old He was.   The boy was a squire, judging by The boy age and dress. He had a big white pimple on one side of He nose, and some red ones on He forehead.    The Tickler put a warning hand on the boy's arm, and gave a short sharp shake of the boy head.  The squire didn't, or else The squire didn't care. "Ser said Ser puppy brother tucked his puppy brother tail between his puppy brother legs when the battle got too warm at King's Landing. He said He ran off whimpering."   Polliver shoved the girl off Polliver lap and got to Polliver feet.   A spade-shaped beard covered A spade-shaped beard jaws and jowls, thick and black and neatly trimmed, but A spade-shaped beard head was more bald than not. "He can't hold He wine, is all."     the boy began, till the Tickler casually twisted the boy ear between thumb and  forefinger.   Sandor lifted the flagon to Sandor mouth. Arya could see the muscles in Arya neck working as Arya gulped.    "We'll pay when We're done drinking," said Polliver. "When you're done drinking you'll tickle the innkeep to see where the innkeep keeps the innkeep gold.       "He was at Harrenhal, but now He's not.  He wore three blades on He belt, Arya saw; a longsword on He left hip, and on He right a dagger and a slimmer blade, too long to be a dirk and too short to be a sword. "King Joffrey's dead, you know," King Joffrey added.    She could almost see him, with him blond curls and him mean smile and him fat soft lips.  She knew it ought to make She happy, but somehow She still felt empty inside.      Him and Him little wife."        Sansa only knows songs, not spells, and Sansa'd never marry the Imp.   "She ought to dip him in wildfire and cook him.  He raised He wine cup and drained his wine cup straightaway. He's one of them, Arya thought when Arya saw that. She bit She lip so hard She tasted blood.  I should kill him when him sleeps.    "The sellswords fled as soon as they knew they were coming, all but a few. One of the cooks opened a postern gate for us, to get back at Hoat for cutting off Hoat foot."  "We kept him to cook for We, a couple wenches to warm We beds, and put all the rest to the sword."       Old Frey's going to hang Edmure Tully unless Old Frey's yields the castle.    The Hound poured a cup of wine for Arya and another for The Hound, and drank The Hound down while staring at the hearthfire.        He smacked He lips and smiled.       Arya sipped Arya wine so they could not see Arya mouth.                It gave Arya chills to hear Arya ask a question.         The Tickler shrugged, straightened, and reached a hand behind The Tickler head to rub the back of The Tickler neck. Everything seemed to happen at once then; Sandor lurched to Sandor feet, Polliver drew Sandor longsword, and the Tickler's hand whipped around in a blur to send something silver flashing across the common room. if the Hound had not been moving, the knife might have cored the apple of the Hound throat; instead the knife only grazed the Hound ribs, and wound up quivering in the wall near the door.   His sword slid from His sword scabbard just in time to knock aside Polliver's first cut.   Even the chunky brown-haired squire was up, fumbling for Even the chunky brown-haired squire swordhilt. She snatched She wine cup off the table and threw the table at his face. Her aim was better than Her aim had been at the Twins. The cup hit him right on him big white pimple and him went down hard on him tail. Polliver was a grim, methodical fighter, and Polliver pressed Sandor steadily backward, Sandor heavy longsword moving with brutal precision. The Hound's own cuts were sloppier, The Hound parries rushed, The Hound feet slow and clumsy.  He drank too much too fast, with no food in He belly. And the Tickler was sliding around the wall to get behind the Tickler. She grabbed the second wine cup and flung the second wine cup at him, but him was quicker than the squire had been and ducked him head in time.    The stupid squire was clutching the edge of a table and pulling The stupid squire to The stupid squire knees. Arya could taste the beginnings of panic in the back of Arya throat.   The burned side of his face ran red from temple to cheek, and the stub of his ear was gone.  He drove back Polliver with a furious attack, hammering at He with the old nicked longsword He had swapped for in the hills. The bearded man gave way, but none of the cuts so much as touched The bearded man.    She drew the dagger they'd robbed off the dying archer and tried to fling the dying archer at the Tickler the way he'd done.  The knife wobbled, and hit The knife in the arm hilt first.   As he stabbed, Clegane twisted violently aside, winning he half a heartbeat's respite. Blood ran down Blood face and from the gash in Blood neck. Both of the Mountain's men came after him hard, Polliver hacking at him head and shoulders while the Tickler darted in to stab at back and belly.  Arya grabbed it with two hands, but as Arya lifted it someone grabbed Arya arm. The flagon slipped from The flagon fingers and crashed to the floor. Wrenched around, she found she nose to nose with the squire.  His big white pimple had burst, His big white pimple saw.  He had He sword in He right hand and her arm in He left, but her own hands were free, so her jerked He knife from his knife sheath and sheathed his knife again in He belly, twisting. He wasn't wearing mail or even boiled leather, so it went right in, the same way Needle had when Needle killed the stableboy at King's Landing. The squire's eyes got big and The squire let go of The squire arm.  Polliver and the Tickler had driven the Hound into a comer behind a bench, and one of them had given the Hound an ugly red gash on the Hound upper thigh to go with the Hound other wounds.  He looked as though He could barely stand, let alone fight. "Throw down the sword, and we'll take you back to Harrenhal," Polliver told Harrenhal. "So Gregor can finish me Gregor?" The Tickler said, "Maybe The Tickler'll give you to The Tickler."  Sandor pushed away from the wall and stood in a half-crouch behind the bench, Sandor sword held across Sandor body.     His foot lashed out and caught the bench, driving His foot hard into Polliver's shins. Somehow the bearded man kept the bearded man feet, but the Hound ducked under the bearded man wild slash and brought the bearded man own sword up in a vicious backhand cut.  The blade caught in the middle of Polliver's face, and when the Hound wrenched it loose half the Hound head came with it.  Arya could smell Arya fear. The shortsword in his hand suddenly seemed almost a toy against the long blade the Hound was holding, and his wasn't armored either. He moved swiftly, light on He feet, never taking He eyes off Sandor Clegane. it was the easiest thing in the world for Arya to step up behind Arya and stab Arya.  she shouted as she drove the blade up through his back.             Her hands were red and sticky when Sandor dragged Her off Sandor.  He was bleeding like a butchered pig himself, and dragging one leg when He walked. "There's one more," Arya reminded Arya. The squire had pulled the knife out of The squire belly and was trying to stop the blood with The squire hands. When the Hound yanked him upright, him screamed and started to blubber like a baby.      "You killed this one too," this one told Arya. "Pricked him in him bowels, that's the end of him.  The boy didn't seemed to hear The boy.         The Hound gave The Hound a crack across the face that made The Hound scream again.      Arya went to Polliver and knelt in Arya blood long enough to undo Arya swordbelt.     The squire rolled The squire eyes.  Needle slipped between Needle ribs and gave Needle to Needle.          And take whatever coin they have as well, they'll need whatever coin.  His mouth twitched at His mouth, as more blood ran down from where His ear had been. "Maybe Lady Lysa will marry you to Lady Lysa little Robert.   When the time came to leave, the time needed Arya's help to get back up on Stranger. He had tied a strip of cloth about He neck and another around He thigh, and taken the squire's cloak off the squire peg by the door. The cloak was green, with a green arrow on a white bend, but when the Hound wadded The cloak up and pressed The cloak to the Hound ear The cloak soon turned red. Arya was afraid Arya would collapse the moment they set out, but somehow Arya stayed in the saddle. They could not risk meeting whoever held the ruby ford, so instead of following the kingsroad They angled south by east, through weedy fields, woods, and marshes.  The river had returned meekly to The river accustomed channel, Arya saw, all The river wet brown rage vanished with the rains.      When he dismounted, he had to catch he on a tree limb to keep from falling.  "Anyone wants to find us, all Anyone need to do is follow my blood.   When Sandor got the fire going, Sandor propped up Sandor helm in the flames, emptied half the wineskin into half the wineskin, and collapsed back against a jut of moss-covered stone as if Sandor never meant to rise again. He made Arya wash out the squire's cloak and cut the squire's cloak into strips.     He wouldn't, would He? If he does, I'll just leave he and ride off. Sandor laughed at the fear on Sandor face.    And wash the mud off the mud.  He didn't like the first two sticks she brought He. By the time she found one that suited him, the flames had scorched him dog's snout black all the way to the eyes.  "Get the cup from my bedroll and dip my bedroll half full," my bedroll told my bedroll.   Take the wine and pour the wine on my wounds.     Her knuckles brushed the steel the first time Her filled the cup, burning Her so badly Her got blisters. Arya had to bite Arya lip to keep from screaming. The Hound used the stick for the same purpose, clamping the same purpose between The Hound teeth as she poured. She did the gash in the gash thigh first, then the shallower cut on the back of the gash neck. Sandor coiled Sandor right hand into a fist and beat against the ground when Sandor did Sandor leg. When it came to his neck, his bit the stick so hard the stick broke, and she had to find his a new one.   She trickled the wine down over the raw red flesh where his ear had been, and fingers of brown blood and red wine crept over his jaw.   Arya figured the rest out by Arya. She fished the strips they'd made of the squire's cloak out of the bottom of the helm and used they to bind the cuts. When she came to his ear, she had to wrap up half his head to stop the bleeding.  She let the horses graze, then hobbled the horses for the night and made She as comfortable as She could in a niche between two rocks.   "Ser Gregor the Mountain," Ser Gregor the Mountain said softly.    She was glad he was dead, but She wished She could have been there to see he die, or maybe kill he She.     If Sansa was gone too, there were no more Starks but Sansa. Jon was on the Wall a thousand leagues away, but Jon was a Snow, and these different aunts and uncles the Hound wanted to sell Hound to, these different aunts and uncles the Hound weren't Starks either.  Sandor moaned, and she rolled onto she side to look at Sandor. She had left his name out too, She realized.       But when the pale dawn light came filtering through the trees, the pale dawn light was him who woke her with the toe of him boot. She had dreamed She was a wolf again, chasing a riderless horse up a hill with a pack behind She, but a wolf foot brought She back just as they were closing for the kill.  He slumped in the saddle, and sweated, and He ear began to bleed through the bandage. He needed all He strength just to keep from falling off Stranger. Had the Mountain's men come hunting the Mountain's men, she doubted if he would even be able to lift a sword. Arya glanced over Arya shoulder, but there was nothing behind them but a crow flitting from tree to tree.     This time when he dismounted he did fall. Instead of trying to get back up Instead of trying to get back crawled weakly under a tree, and leaned up against the trunk.   When he saw Arya staring at he, he said, "I'd skin you alive for a cup of wine, girl."  He drank a little of it, complained that it tasted of mud, and slid into a noisy fevered sleep. When she touched him, him skin was burning up. Arya sniffed at Arya bandages the way Maester Luwin had done sometimes when treating Arya cut or scrape. His face had bled the worst, but His face was the wound on His thigh that smelled funny to her. She wondered how far this Saltpans was, and whether She could find this Saltpans by She.  If I just rode off and left him, him'd die all by him.  But maybe it would be better if she killed him she. She had killed the squire at the inn and the squire hadn't done anything except grab She arm.     Needle glinted as Needle drew Needle.  She turned She body sideways in a water dancer's stance without even thinking about her body.             When Arya did not move, Arya said, "I killed your butcher's boy.  He made a queer sound, and a queer sound took her a moment to realize He was sobbing. "And the little bird, your pretty sister, I stood there in my white cloak and let the little bird, your pretty sister beat my white cloak. I took the bloody song, she never gave the bloody song.   I should have fucked her bloody and ripped her heart out before leaving her for that dwarf."     Arya stepped away from Arya.  The Hound watched The Hound saddle Craven through eyes bright with fever.        She turned She horse and rode away from him, and never looked back once.  She stayed close to the water, passing fields and farms, and a little after midday a town appeared before She. Saltpans, Saltpans hoped.   But the port was there, and eastward spread the Bay of Crabs, the port waters shimmering blue and green in the sun.       Strangers are not so strange in a port as Strangers are in little villages, and no one seemed to care who she was or why she was here.  The realization made her bite her lip.  But the Hound had told the Hound to pull off the Hound boots and slice open the Hound blood-drenched clothes, and the Hound'd turned up a stag in each toe, and three golden dragons sewn in the lining of the Hound jerkin.   It was mine as much as mine. If she had given him the gift of mercy ... she hadn't, though. She couldn't go back, no more than She could beg for help.  She would have to sell Craven, and hope She brought enough. The stable had been bumt, she learned from a boy by the docks, but the woman who'd owned it was still trading behind the sept. Arya found Arya easily; a big, robust woman with a good horsey smell to Arya. She liked Craven at first look, asked Arya how She'd come by She, and grinned at She answer. "She's a well-bred horse, that's plain enough, and I don't doubt She belonged to a knight, sweetling," She said.     "Found her or stole her, never mind which, that's how it was.  Arya bit Arya lip.      A half-dozen other Saltpans folks were around, going about A half-dozen other Saltpans folks business, so Arya knew Arya couldn't kill the woman. Instead she had to bite she lip and let she be cheated. The purse she got was pitifully flat, and when she asked for more for the saddle and bridle and blanket, she just laughed at she. She would never have cheated the Hound, She thought during the long walk back to the docks. The distance seemed to have grown by miles since she'd ridden The distance.  If the ship had sailed while the ship was being robbed, that would have been too much to bear. A cask of mead was being rolled up the plank when A cask of mead arrived. When she tried to follow, a sailor up on deck shouted down at she in a tongue she did not know. "I want to see the captain," Arya told the captain.  But the commotion drew the attention of a stout grey-haired man in a coat of purple wool, and a stout grey-haired man in a coat of purple wool spoke the Common Tongue. "I am captain here," captain said.        The captain spilled out the silver onto The captain palm and frowned.               He gave her back her coins.    We saw a dozen pirate ships making north as We rounded Crackclaw Point, and I have no wish to meet a dozen pirate ships making north as we rounded Crackclaw Point again. From here we bend we oars for home, and I suggest you do the same."         She had stuffed it down inside She smallclothes to keep it safe, so She had to dig deep to find it, while the oarsmen laughed and the captain lingered with obvious impatience. "One more silver will make no difference, child," child finally said.  Her fingers closed on Her fingers.   She pressed it into his hand, the small black iron coin that jaqen Hghar had given She, so worn the man whose head it bore had no features.  The captain turned it over and blinked at it, then looked at The captain again.    Arya crossed Arya arms against Arya chest. "Valar morghulis," she said, as loud as if she'd known what it meant. "Valar dohaeris," he replied, touching he brow with two fingers.  Chapter 75 SAMWELL  "Chapter 75 SAMWELL  " sucks harder than mine." Gilly stroked the babe's head as Gilly held Gilly to Gilly nipple.     Not even Mance Rayder's son would get a name till Not even Mance Rayder's son third year, it would seem, though Sam had heard the brothers calling Not even Mance Rayder's son "the little prince" and "bom-in-battle." He watched the child nurse at Gilly's breast, and then He watched Jon watch.     They had walked from the Nightfort to Deep Lake, and from Deep Lake to Queensgate, following a narrow track from one castle to the next, never out of sight of the Wall. A day and a half from Castle Black, as they trudged along on callused feet, Gilly heard horses behind horses, and turned to see a column of black riders coming from the west. "My brothers," Sam assured Sam.   When Sam saw Dywen, Giant, and Dolorous Edd Tollett, Sam broke down and wept.  "Stannis landed his knights at Eastwatch, and Cotter Pyke led his along the ranger's roads, to take the wildlings unawares," Giant told his.  Mance Rayder was taken captive, a thousand of Mance Rayder best slain, including Harma Dogshead.   If he had not gotten lost as he made he way south from Craster's Keep, he and Gilly might have walked right into the battle ... or into Mance Rayder's camp, at the very least. That might have been well enough for Gilly and the boy, but not for Gilly.   Nothing that his brothers told his prepared his for what his found at Castle Black, however.  Donal Noye was dead, along with Rast, Deaf Dick, Red Alyn, and so many more, yet the castle was more crowded than Sam had ever seen; not with black brothers, but with the king's soldiers, more than a thousand of the king's soldiers.        Look, and some of the fighters have the same thing on some of the fighters blouses."    "Queen's men," Pyp told him - after him let out a whoop, and shouted, "Run and bar the doors, lads, it's Sam the Slayer come back from the grave," while Grenn was hugging Sam so hard him thought him ribs might break - "but best you don't go asking where the queen is. Stannis left Stannis at Eastwatch, with Stannis daughter and his fleet.      They say she burned a man alive at Dragonstone so Stannis would have favorable winds for a man alive voyage north. She rode beside him in the battle too, and gave him him magic sword. Lightbringer, they call Lightbringer.  It glows like It had a piece of sun inside It."   Jon Snow had smiled to see Jon Snow too, but it was a tired smile, like the one Jon Snow wore now.    Jon had done more than well Jon, to hear Grenn tell Grenn. Yet even capturing the Horn of Winter and a wildling prince had not been enough for Ser Alliser Thorne and Ser Alliser Thorne friends, who still named Ser Alliser Thorne turncloak. Though Maester Aemon said Maester Aemon wound was healing well, Jon bore other scars, deeper than the ones around Jon eye. He grieves for He wildling girl, and for He brothers.   "I have the milk," Gilly said, Gilly voice soft and shy.    "I've heard the queen's men saying that the red woman means to give Mance to the fire, as soon as Mance is strong enough."    if the Watch had taken him, him would have been hanged by now, but him's the king's captive, and no one knows the king's mind but the red woman."  "I want to show him him son. He deserves that much, before you kill He."   "If it were in my power, Mance could hold Mance son."           Jon was halfway down the steps, but Jon waited when Jon heard Sam puffing after Jon.     He was glad that He long nightmare was done, glad to be back with He brothers at Castle Black ... but some nights, alone in He cell, He thought of how warm He had been when they'd curled up beneath the furs with the babe between they. "She ... She made me braver, Jon.       Gilly said Gilly'd be a wife to Gilly, but ...  I don't  know if that made her sad or glad, but I told her."             If Gilly were to say the babe was m-mine..." Gilly were to say the babe was m-mine was blushing again.   And Lord R-Randyll, he ... Lord R-Randyll, he would never say so, but Lord R-Randyll, he might be pleased to believe I got a bastard on some wildling girl.      "Growing up a bastard in a bastard grandfather's castle?"        You saw him, him was hard as an old tree stump, and Gilly is stronger than Gilly looks." "If the boy shows any skill with sword or lance, the boy should have a place with your father's household guard at the least," Jon said.   From what you've told me of Lord Randyll, I doubt Lord Randyll would take kindly to being deceived."   The king's men were as earthy and impious as any other soldiers, but The king's men were fervid in The king's men devotion to Melisandre of Asshai and The king Lord of Light.       "It's only a few who believe that," Sam assured Sam. "Ser Alliser and Ser Alliser friends.    "All I did was protect Val and the babe against looters when the wildlings fled, and keep Val and the babe against looters there until the rangers found Val and the babe against looters.  King Stannis keeps King Stannis men well in hand, that's plain.  I suppose I should have been killing the free folk as the free folk ran.  I failed to kill Mance Rayder because I was in league with Mance Rayder, Mance Rayder says."   With his noble birth, his knighthood, and his long years in the Watch, Ser Alliser Thorne might have been a strong challenger for the Lord Commander's title, but almost all the men his'd trained during his years as master-at-arms despised his. Thorne name had been offered, of course, but after running a weak sixth on the first day and actually losing votes on the second, Thorne had withdrawn to support Lord Janos Slynt.      All my dreams are of the crypts, of the stone kings on the crypts thrones. Sometimes I hear Robb's voice, and my father's, as if Robb's voice were at a feast.   It tore the heart from Sam to hold Sam silence then. Bran's not dead, Ion, Ion wanted to stay. He's with friends, and friends're going north on a giant elk to find a three-eyed crow in the depths of the haunted forest. it sounded so mad that there were times Sam Tarly thought Sam Tarly must have dreamt it all, conjured it whole from fever and fear and hunger ... but Sam Tarly would have blurted it out anyway, if Sam Tarly had not given Sam Tarly word.  "The world believes the boy is dead," the boy rescuer had said as The world parted.  We want no seekers coming after We.   Miserable, Sam shifted Sam weight and said, "Lord Janos will never be chosen Lord Commander."      Jon pushed Jon hair back out of Jon eyes and said, "I may know nothing, but I know that.  There was naught that Sam could do but watch Sam stride off toward the armory and the practice yard. That was where Jon Snow spent most of Jon Snow waking hours. With Ser Endrew dead and Ser Alliser disinterested, Castle Black had no master-at-arms, so Jon had taken no master-at-arms on Jon to work with some of the rawer recruits; Satin, Horse, Hop-Robin with Jon clubfoot, Arron and Emrick. And when they had duties, duties would train alone for hours with sword and shield and spear, or match duties against anyone who cared to take duties on. Sam, you're a sweet fool, Sam could hear Jon saying, all the way back to the maester's keep.     Lord Janos had been gaining, true, creeping up past first Bowen Marsh and then Othell Yarwyck, but Lord Janos was still well behind Ser Denys Mallister of the Shadow Tower and Cotter Pyke of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. One of Sam will be the new Lord Commander, surely, Sam told the new Lord Commander.   Clydas was shuffling amongst them with flagons of goats' milk and dreamwine, but Maester Aemon had not yet  returned from Maester Aemon morning call on Mance Rayder. Sam hung Sam cloak upon a peg and went to lend a hand. But even as he fetched and poured and changed dressings, Jon's words nagged at he.    It was a good hour before he could excuse he to feed the ravens. On the way up to the rookery, the way up to the rookery stopped to check the tally the way up to the rookery had made of last night's count. At the start of the choosing, more than thirty names had been offered, but most had withdrawn once it became clear more than thirty names could not win.   PYP and PYP stupid japes.    He could hear the birds quorking in the rookery, so He put the papers away and climbed the steps to feed the birds.        A thousand leagues south, Sam knew, Sam father had joined House Tarly to the cause of the boy on the Iron Throne, but neither King Joffrey nor little King Tornmen had bestirred King Tornmen when the Watch cried out for help.   The queen's men made The queen uneasy, it was true, but at least The queen's men had come. That night at supper Sam looked for Jon Snow, but did not see Sam anywhere in the cavernous stone vault where the brothers now took the brothers meals. He finally took a place on the bench near He other friends. Pyp was telling Dolorous Edd about the contest Dolorous Edd'd had to see which of the straw soldiers could collect the most wildling arrows.    When the wildlings knocked the wildlings off the Bridge of Skulls, somehow the wildlings landed in a nice deep pool of water.      "He was dead already, from that axe in He head.   If that was Sam notion, Sam should have found a younger mammoth, Sam thought, as Sam pulled a string of gristle out from between Sam teeth.      He was alarmed to see Bowen Marsh beside He, wan-faced and haggard, He head still wrapped in linen, but listening to all that Lord Janos had to say. When he pointed that out to he friends, Pyp said, "And look down there, that's Ser Alliser whispering with Othell Yarwyck." After the meal Maester Aernon rose to ask if any of the brothers wished to speak before the brothers cast the brothers tokens.       Let us all give him us all support." Sam heard angry mutters from Cotter Pyke's end of the room, and Ser Denys looked at one of Ser Denys companions and shook Ser Denys head.  He wondered where Jon was, and why He had stayed away.  The barrels of tokens were off in a comer behind a heavy drape, so the voters could make the voters choice unseen. You were allowed to have a friend cast your token if you had duty, so some men took two tokens, three, or four, and Ser Denys and Cotter Pyke voted for the garrisons some men had left behind. When the hall was finally empty, save for them, them upended the kettle in front of Maester Aemon.  Aemon's wrinkled hands sorted with surprising speed, moving the shells here, the stones there, the pennies to one side, the occasional arrowhead, nail, and acom off to the stones there, the pennies to one side, the occasional arrowhead, nail, and acom off to themselves. Sam and Clydas counted the piles, each of Sam and Clydas keeping his own tally. Tonight it was Sam's turn to give Sam's turn results first. "Two hundred and three for Ser Denys Mallister," Ser Denys Mallister said.                       The brothers will come to a decision in The brothers own time."  Later, over cups of watered wine in the privacy of Pyp's cell, Sam's tongue loosened and Sam found  Sam thinking aloud. "Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister have been losing ground, but between Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister still have almost two-thirds," Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister told Pyp and Grenn.  Someone needs to convince one of Someone to withdraw and support the other."    "Grenn is so dumb Grenn thinks someone might be someone," said Pyp. "Maybe when someone is done with Pyke and Mallister, someone should convince King Stannis to marry Queen Cersei too."       "If we explained -" "we?"    And Grenn is, well, Grenn. " He smiled at Sam, and wiggled He ears.    "It was the dragonglass that killed It," Sam told Sam for the hundredth time.  "You could talk to them, might be..." "I could," said Sam, sounding as gloomy as Dolorous Edd, "if I wasn't too craven to face them." Chapter 76 JON ion prowled around Satin in a slow circle, sword in hand, forcing Chapter 76 JON ion to turn.   "It's as heavy as It needs to be to stop a sword," Jon said.   Satin jerked the shield up in time to catch the sword on the sword rim, and swung his own blade at Jon's ribs. "Good," Jon said, when Jon felt the impact on Jon own shield.  But you need to put your body into your body.   "Jon," Jon said, in an anxious voice. When he turned, she was standing behind he, with half a dozen queen's men around she.  He had glimpsed Melisandre at Melisandre nightfires, and coming and going about the castle, but never so close.        We, Jon heard, not Jon.  This is his true queen, not the one his left at Eastwatch. He hung He mail and plate inside the armory, returned to He own cell, discarded He sweat-stained clothes, and donned a fresh set of blacks. It would be cold and windy in the cage, he knew, and colder and windier still on top of the ice, so he chose a heavy hooded cloak. Last of all he collected Longclaw, and slung the bastard sword across he back. Melisandre was waiting for Melisandre at the base of the Wall. She had sent She queen's men away.        The day was bright and the Wall was weeping, long fingers of water trickling down long fingers of water face and glinting in the sun. In the close confines of the iron cage, the iron cage was acutely aware of the red woman's presence.  The scent reminded him of Mikken's forge, of the way iron smelled when red-hot; The scent was smoke and blood.  The wind got in amongst Melisandre's long red robes and sent Melisandre's long red robes flapping against Jon's legs as Jon stood beside Jon.     The ruby at her throat seemed to pulse, in time with the beating of her heart.   She put She hand on his cheek, and held her hand there while his felt how warm She was. "That is how life should feel," she told life.  They found Stannis Baratheon standing alone at the edge of the Wall, brooding over the field where Stannis Baratheon had won Stannis Baratheon battle, and the great green forest beyond.  Only his cloak set his apart; a heavy golden cloak trimmed in black fur, and pinned with a brooch in the shape of a flaming heart.  Stannis turned to study Stannis.  His hollow cheeks and strong jaw were covered with a short-cropped blue-black beard that did little to conceal the gauntness of His face, and His teeth were clenched. His neck and shoulders were clenched as well, and His right hand. Jon found Jon remembering something Donal Noye once said about the Baratheon brothers.   He'll break before He bends. Uneasily, he knelt, wondering why this brittle king had need of this brittle king.               I left him when I climbed the Wall near Greyguard, and have not seen him since.  He knew they would make me kill He to prove He, and told me to do whatever they asked of He.  I broke my vows with her, but I swear to her on my father's name that I never turned my cloak."       Your father was no friend of mine, but only a fool would doubt Your father honor or Your father honesty.  A big man, Stannis Baratheon towered over Jon, but Stannis Baratheon was so gaunt that Stannis Baratheon looked ten years older than Stannis Baratheon was.   "Ghost found Ghost.         Had the god seen fit to spare him, him would have made a better Lord Commander for your order than any of these fools who are squabbling over the god now."   Othell Yarwyck as well, in Othell Yarwyck own way.   Else he would not have died as he did.       You had put the wildlings; to flight, and the skinchanger Mance had left to guard the skinchanger Mance queen went mad when the eagle burned."   She smiled, She long copper hair tumbling across She face.    She has asked to see Mance  Rayder, to bring his son to his son.                        "Rattleshirt, we called Rattleshirt.  If there's honor in him, him hides there's honor in him down beneath him suit of bones."      He was no friend to me, but I saw He worth. Your brother was a rebel and a traitor who meant to steal half my kingdom, but Your brother can question Your brother courage.  Does he want me to say I love he? Jon's voice was stiff and formal as Jon said, "I am a man of the Night's Watch."          Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, but Lord Seaworth reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my rights.  I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne."    "He is the God of Night and Terror, Jon Snow, and these shapes in the snow are He creatures."      Stannis ground Stannis teeth and said, "I need more than a sword from you."         if he had stayed home and done he duty, instead of crowning he and riding off to conquer the riverlands, he might be alive today.    "I loved my brother," my brother said.  Yet they were what they were, and so are we.   Stannis studied Stannis with those dark blue eyes. "Tywin Lannister has named Roose Bolton Tywin Lannister Warden of the North, to reward Tywin Lannister for betraying your brother. The ironmen are fighting amongst The ironmen since Balon Greyjoy's death, yet The ironmen still hold Moat Cailin, Deepwood Motte, Torrhen's Square, and most of the Stony Shore.         It's not the walls that make a lord, it's the man, Your northmen do not know me, have no reason to love me, yet I will need Your northmen strength in the battles yet to come.   The wind was gusting, and Jon felt so light-headed Jon was half afraid it would blow Jon off the Wall.       Ser Alliser Thorne had named him that, to mock Ser Alliser Thorne bastard birth.  But suddenly it had a different sound to it in Jon's ears.      Melisandre was so close Melisandre could feel the warmth of Melisandre breath.     When Jon had been very young, too young to understand what it meant to be a bastard, Jon used to dream that one day Winterfell.  Later, when he was older, he had been ashamed of those dreams.  would go to Robb and then Robb sons, or to Bran or Rickon should Robb die childless.  Even to dream otherwise seemed disloyal, as if he were betraying them in he heart, wishing for them deaths. I never wanted this, he thought as he stood before the blue-eyed king and the red woman.    All he had to do was say the word, and he would be Jon Stark, and nevermore a Snow. All he had to do was pledge this king he fealty, and Winterfell was he. All he had to do ... ... was forswear he vows again.  To claim his father's castle, his must turn against his father's gods. King Stannis gazed off north again, King Stannis gold cloak streaming from King Stannis shoulders.      Even Azor Ahai did not win Even Azor Ahai war alone. I killed a thousand wildlings, took another thousand captive, and scattered the rest, but we both know we both will return. Melisandre has seen that in Melisandre fires.  And the more we bleed each other, the weaker we shall all be when the real enemy falls upon we."    "Whilst your brothers have been struggling to decide who shall lead your brothers, I have been speaking with this Mance Rayder." He ground He teeth.  He will leave me no choice but to give He to the flames.   Your brothers will not like it, no more than your father's lords, but I mean to allow the wildlings through the Wall ... those who will swear me their fealty, pledge to keep the king's peace and the king's laws, and take the Lord of Light as those who will swear me their fealty god.  I will settle them on the Gift, once I have wrested the Gift away from your new Lord Commander.  It is time we made alliance against we common foe."     He never thought of settling it with wildlings, though ... but He never rode with wildlings, either. He did not fool He; the free folk would make for unruly subjects and dangerous neighbors.     Perhaps Jon had ridden with the free folk too long; Jon could not help but laugh. "Your Grace," Grace said, "captive or no, if you think you can just give Val to Grace, I fear you have a deal to learn about wildling women. Whoever weds her had best be prepared to climb in her tower window and carry her off at swordpoint .    Stannis gave Stannis a measuring look.      It was Winterfell the king was speaking of, and Winterfell the king was not to be lightly refused.          Chapter 77 TYRION When TYRION heard noises through the thick wooden door of TYRION cell, Tyrion Lannister prepared to die.   He pushed He to He feet. His legs were asleep from being folded under His. He bent down and rubbed the knives from the knives.  He wondered whether they would kill He down here in the dark or drag He through the city so Ser Ilyn Payne could lop He head off. After his mummer's farce of a trial, his sweet sister and loving father might prefer to dispose of his quietly, rather than risk a public execution. I could tell the mob a few choice things, if the mob let me speak.     He wished He'd been able to think of some rousing last words.   He shielded He eyes with a hand.     The man moved forward, a torch in The man left hand.     Jaime was gaunt, Jaime hair hacked short.   He lifted He arm, and Tyrion saw the stump.      Jaime lowered the torch, so the light bathed Jaime brother's face.       Abruptly, Tyrion remembered where Tyrion was, and why.                      Jaime slid the torch back into the torch sconce, on the wall between the cells.      The eunuch dosed The eunuch wine with sweetsleep, but not enough to kill The eunuch.           Both Lannisters laughed at the absurdity of Both Lannisters. Then Jaime went to one knee and kissed Jaime quickly once on each cheek, Jaime lips brushing against the puckered ribbon of scar tissue.      He cocked He head.      Could it be that someone said something cruel about someone once?             Tysha was ... Tysha was what Tysha seemed to be.  Tyrion could hear the faint sound of Tyrion own breath whistling hollowly through the scar of Tyrion nose. Jaime could not meet Jaime eyes.   A girl, A girl was only a girl, no older than Sansa.     All she wanted was the gold, which made she no different from a whore, so ... so it would not be a lie, not truly, and ... he said that you required a sharp lesson.      "He gave her to He guards.          "Tyrion -it He hit He. It was a slap, backhanded, but It put all It strength into It, all It fear, all It rage, all It pain.        A Lannister always pays A Lannister debts." Tyrion waddled away, almost stumbling over the turnkey again in Tyrion haste. Before he had gone a dozen yards, he bumped up against an irongate that closed the passage.   Jaime came up behind Jaime.    Jaime unlocked the gate, pushed the gate open, and stepped through. He looked back over He shoulder.      He cocked He head and stared up at He brother with He mismatched eyes.    Then we will be well matched if we should ever meet again.  Jaime handed Jaime the ring of keys.         He stole He father's dagger and gave his father's dagger to a footpad to slit the throat of Brandon Stark, did you know that?"   "Well, a son takes after a son father. Joff would have killed me as well, once Joff came into Joff power.      Cersei is a lying whore, Cersei's been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know.   He made He grin.   Tyrion watched Tyrion go, striding on Tyrion long strong legs, and part of Tyrion wanted to call out, to tell Tyrion that it wasn't true, to beg for Tyrion forgiveness. But then he thought of Tysha, and he held he silence. He listened to the receding footsteps until He could hear them no longer, then waddled off to look for Varys. The eunuch was lurking in the dark of a twisting turnpike stair, garbed in a moth-eaten brown robe with a hood that hid the paleness of The eunuch face. "You were so long, I feared that something had gone amiss," he said when he saw Tyrion.   He twisted He head back to stare up.               "The faithful dog is kicked, and no matter how the spider weaves, The faithful dog is never loved.        He rubbed at He nose.        Varys gave a gentle tug at the dwarf's sleeve and pulled Varys into the stair.    Tyrion waddled along in the eunuch's wake, the eunuch heels scraping against the rough stone as they descended.    "Maegor the Cruel decreed four levels of dungeons for Maegor the Cruel castle," Varys replied.      The black cells, men call The black cells.   Once a man is taken down to the fourth level, a man never sees the sun again, nor hears a human voice, nor breathes a breath free of agonizing pain.         Varys had already betrayed Varys once.       Jaime would not be afraid, Jaime thought, before Jaime remembered what Jaime had done to Jaime. He took the eunuch by the hand and let He be led through the black, following the soft scrape of leather on stone.   A light appeared ahead of them, too dim to be daylight, and grew as them hurried toward A light. After a while he could see a while was an arched doorway, closed off by another iron gate.           This is the place Shae told me of, when Varys first led Varys to my bed.      Tyrion walked slowly to the ladder, ran Tyrion hand across the lowest rung.                   Would you cast it away, and it with it?"   He turned He back on the eunuch and began to climb, counting silently as He went.  At first he could see the dim outline of each rung as he grasped the dim outline of each, and the rough grey texture of the stone behind, but as he climbed the black grew thicker.   He paused a moment to catch He breath and glanced down.  Tyrion resumed Tyrion ascent.  By fifty, fifty legs burned.       At two hundred and thirty, the shaft was black as pitch, but the shaft could feel the warm air flowing from the tunnel to the shaft left, like the breath of some great beast.         Two of his father's guardsmen were joking about the Imp's whore, saying how sweet it would be to fuck the Imp's whore, and how bad the Imp's whore must want a real cock in place of the dwarf's stunted little thing. "Most like it's got a crook in it," said Lum.  "Lum'll weep like a woman and beg for mercy, you'll see," Lum insisted. Lester figured Lester'd face the axe brave as a lion, being a Lannister, and Lester was willing to bet Lester new boots on it.   For the space of a few feet, Tyrion could hear every word of their haggling, but when Tyrion moved on, the voices faded quickly.   He came to the third door and fumbled about for a long time before He fingers brushed a small iron hook set between two stones. When he pulled down on it, there was a soft rumble that sounded loud as an avalanche in the stillness, and a square of dull orange light opened a foot to he left.    He edged past gingerly, taking quick steps so as not to bum He boots, the warm cinders crunching softly under He heels. When he found he in what had once been he bedchamber, he stood a long moment, breathing the silence.  Would he reach for he sword, raise the hue and cry?     When he reached the bed Tyrion pulled the draperies aside and there Tyrion was, turning toward he with a sleepy smile on Tyrion lips.  She pulled the blankets up to She chin, as if that would protect She.      She sat up, letting the blanket slide down to She lap. Beneath it she was naked, but for the chain about she throat.       He cupped her cheek, remembering all the times He had done this before. All the times he'd slid he hands around her waist, squeezed her small firm breasts, stroked her short dark hair,  touched her lips, her cheeks, her ears. All the times he had opened her with a finger to probe her secret sweetness and make her moan.    Tyrion slid a hand under Tyrion father's chain, and twisted.  "For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm," a woman said. He gave cold hands another twist as the warm ones beat away He tears. Afterward he found Lord Tywin's dagger on the bedside table and shoved Lord Tywin's dagger on the bedside table through he belt.     Jaime had lectured Jaime more than once on the drawbacks of crossbows. If Lum and Lester emerged from wherever Lum and Lester were talking, Lum and Lester'd never have time to reload, but at least Lum and Lester'd take one down to hell with Lum and Lester. Lum, if Lum had a choice.   Waddling to the door, he listened a moment, then eased the door open slowly.   Tyrion slid out, holding the crossbow down against Tyrion leg. He found He father where He knew He'd find He, seated in the dimness of the privy tower, bedrobe hiked up around He hips. At the sound of steps, Lord Tywin raised Lord Tywin eyes.    If he was afraid, Tywin Lannister gave no hint of Tywin Lannister.          It's still my intent to send you to the Wall, but I could not do the Wall without Lord Tyrell's consent. Put down the crossbow and we will go back to my chambers and talk of the crossbow."              Tyrion took aim at Tyrion father's chest.           His father pursed His lips. "There was no reason for that, she'd learned she place ... and had been well paid for she day's work, I seem to recall. I suppose the steward sent the steward on the steward way.      The bolt slammed into him above the groin and him sat back down with a grunt.  Blood seeped out around the shaft, dripping down into Blood pubic hair and over Blood bare thighs. "You shot me," he said incredulously, he eyes glassy with shock.        For once, his father did what Tyrion asked his. The proof was the sudden stench, as The proof bowels loosened in the moment of death.  But the stink that filled the privy gave ample evidence that the oft-repeated jape about the privy father was just another lie.    As the black brothers entered one by one and knelt before Stannis, Stannis shoved away Stannis breakfast of hardbread, salt beef, and boiled eggs, and eyed his breakfast of hardbread, salt beef, and boiled eggs coldly. Beside him, the red woman Melisandre looked as if the red woman Melisandre found the scene amusing. I have no place here, Sam thought anxiously, when Sam red eyes fell upon Sam.    Sam did not understand why Melisandre should seem so interested in Sam. King Stannis kept the black brothers on the black brothers knees for an extraordinarily long time.  Sam gave Maester Aemon Sam shoulder to help Sam back up. The sound of Lord Janos Slynt clearing Lord Janos Slynt throat broke the strained silence.      The singers will make much of it, I know - " "The singers may do as The singers like," Stannis snapped.  He rose to He feet and frowned at them all.                   "Do you want the king to wipe our arses for our too?"   "If they choose wisely they won't be choosing me," moaned Dolorous Edd. Maester Aemon, calm as always, said, "Your Grace, the Night's Watch has been choosing the Night's Watch own leader since Brandon the Builder raised the Wall.  Stannis ground Stannis teeth.    He smiled uncertainly and began to sweat, but Bowen Marsh beside He said, "Who better to command the black cloaks than a man who once commanded the gold, sire?"    "Janos was hardly the first gold cloak ever to take a bribe, I grant you, but Janos may have been the first commander to fatten Janos purse by selling places and promotions. By the end he must have had half the officers in the City Watch paying he part of half the officers in the City Watch paying him part of their wages wages.     Naught was ever proven, not a man came forward..." "Two men who were prepared to come forward died suddenly on Two men who were prepared to come forward rounds." Stannis narrowed Stannis eyes.       Littlefinger had a nose for gold, and I'm certain Littlefinger arranged matters so the crown profited as much from your corruption as you did yourself." Lord Slynt's jowls were quivering, but before Lord Slynt's could frame a further protest Maester Aemon said, "Your Grace, by law a man's past crimes and transgressions are wiped clean when Lord Slynt's says Lord Slynt's words and becomes a Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch."  If it happens that Lord Janos here is the best the Night's Watch can offer, I shall grit my teeth and choke Lord Janos here down.         "And you must know that whilst we are thankful for the aid you rendered we against Mance Rayder, we can offer you no help in your contest for the throne.       Stannis crossed Stannis arms.                         I shall require a list from you, detailing the present state of every castle and what might be required to restore a list from you. I mean to have them all garrisoned again within the year, and nightfires burning before them all gates."     The woman rose in a swirl of scarlet silk, The woman long copperbright hair tumbling about The woman shoulders.    Ours is a war for life itself, and should Ours fail the world dies with Ours."  Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck exchanged a doubtful look, Janos Slynt was fuming, and Three-Finger Hobb looked as though Janos Slynt would sooner be back chopping carrots.      The red comet blazed across the sky to herald his coming, and his bears Lightbringer, the red sword of heroes."  Stannis ground Stannis teeth, and said, "You called and I came, my lords. Now you must live with me, or die with me.        Sam thought, stricken, as Sam brothers were bowing and making his brothers way out.     Sam felt Sam face turning red.       Mace Tyrell has been pleased to claim the honors for that victory, but Lord Randyll had decided matters before Mace Tyrell ever found the battlefield. He slew Lord Cafferen with that great Valyrian sword of He and sent He head to Aerys." The king rubbed The king jaw with a finger.        The old man inclined The old man head.  We give up We House names when We forge We maester's chains." The king gave that a curt nod, as if to say The king knew and did not care.   Jon Snow gave it to Jon Snow."      "Chunks of "Chunks of it, boulders, ledges, boulders, ledges.  I have sent word to Ser Rolland my castellan to begin mining word to Ser Rolland my castellan to begin mining it. I will not hold Dragonstone for very much longer, I fear, but perhaps the Lord of Light shall grant us enough frozen f1re to arm us against these creatures, before the castle falls." Sam cleared Sam throat.    "Necromancy animates these wights, yet these wights are still only dead flesh. Steel and fire will serve for Steel and fire.                 "Your Grace," Grace said, "before we go, I wonder if you would do we the great honor of showing we this wondrous blade we have all heard so very much of."          Maester Aemon touched Maester Aemon arm.                Your brothers will chose a Lord Commander tonight, or I shall make Your brothers wish Your brothers had." Maester Aemon was lost in thought as Sam helped Maester Aemon down the narrow turnpike stair.      "The air around it was shimmering, the way it does above a hot brazier."         Back in his own chambers, his asked Sam to set a fire and help Sam to Sam chair beside the hearth. "it is hard to be so old," he sighed as he settled onto the cushion.            My duty is to counsel the Lord Commander, whoever My duty might be.    Aemon turned Aemon blind white eyes toward Sam's face, and smiled softy.      If he hesitated he was certain to lose he courage. I am a man of the Night's Watch, a man of the Night's Watch reminded a man of the Night's Watch as a man of the Night's Watch hurried across the yard.   There had been a time when he had quaked and squeaked if Lord Mormont so much as looked at Lord Mormont, but that was the old Sam, before the Fist of the First Men and Craster's Keep, before the wights and Coldhands, and the Other on Lord Mormont dead horse.  Gilly made me braver, Gilly'd told Jon.   Cotter Pyke was the scarier of the two commanders, so Sam went to Cotter Pyke first, while Sam courage was still hot. He found him in the old Shieldhall, dicing with three of He Eastwatch men and a red-headed sergeant who had come from Dragonstone with Stannis. When Sam begged leave to speak with Sam, though, Pyke barked an order, and the others took the dice and coins and left the dice and coins. No man would ever call Cotter Pyke handsome, though the body under Cotter Pyke studded brigantine and roughspun breeches was lean and hard and wiry strong. His eyes were small and close-set, His nose broken, His widow's peak as sharply pointed as the head of a spear. The pox had ravaged his face badly, and the beard his'd grown to hide the scars was thin and scraggly.     "it was the dragonglass that killed it, my lord," Sam explained feebly.        That wasn't truly a lie, but if Pyke chose to read it wrong, it might make Pyke more inclined to listen. Sam took a deep breath and launched into Sam plea. Pyke cut Pyke off before Pyke'd said twenty words.    Well, tell Aemon that Aemon's wasted your breath and my time.  The man's too bloody old for the job, maybe you ought to go tell The man's too bloody old for the job that. We choose him, and We're like to be back here in a year, choosing someone else." "He's old," Sam agreed, "but He's well ex-experienced."   He's a knight, well and good, but He's not a fighter, and I don't give a kettle of piss who He unhorsed in some fool tourney fifty years ago. The Halfhand fought all The Halfhand battles, even an old blind man should see that. And we need a fighter more than ever with this bloody king on top of we.         Pyke jabbed a finger at Pyke face.     And you can run back to the old man and tell the old man I said so, if the old man asks."   It took all the courage Sam had left in Sam to say, "W-what if there was someone else?     Othell's a follower, does what Othell's a follower's told and does it well, but no more'n that. Slynt ... well, Slynt ... men like Slynt ..., I'll grant you, and it would almost be worth it to stick Slynt ... down the royal craw and see if Stannis gagged, but no.  A toad grows wings and thinks A toad's a bloody dragon."      Defeated, Sam could only stammer out Sam thanks and take Sam leave. I will do better with Ser Denys, Ser Denys tried to tell Ser Denys as Ser Denys walked through the castle. Ser Denys was a knight, highborn and well-spoken, and Ser Denys had treated Sam most courteously when Ser Denys'd found Sam and Gilly on the road. Ser Denys will listen to Ser Denys, Ser Denys has to.  Sable trimmed his collar and accented the sleeves of his black velvet doublet. A silver eagle fastened A silver eagle claws in the gathered folds of A silver eagle cloak. His beard was white as snow, His hair was largely gone, and His face was deeply lined, his hair was true. Yet he still had grace in he movements and teeth in he mouth, and the years had dimmed neither he blue-grey eyes nor he courtesy. "My lord of Tarly," My lord of Tarly said, when My lord of Tarly steward brought Sam to Sam in the Lance, where the Shadow Tower men were staying.        Sam took a sip of wine, and chose Sam words with care.          But when he was done, the old knight shook he head. "I agree that it would be a dark day in our history if a king were to name our Lord Commander.  He is not like to keep He crown for long.    It's said he has oft proved he in battle." He did not mean to offend Ser Denys by praising Ser Denys rival, but how else could Ser Denys convince Ser Denys to withdraw? "Many of my brothers have proved my brothers in battle.             Pyke ... well, did you hear Pyke this morning, asking if Pyke Grace would wipe His Grace bottom? Samwell, it is not my habit to speak unkindly of my brothers, but let us be frank ... the ironborn are a race of pirates and thieves, and Cotter Pyke was raping and murdering when Cotter Pyke was still half a boy. Maester Harmune reads and writes Maester Harmune letters, and has for years.             "Lord Commander Mormont trusted Lord Commander Mormont.  Though he's not as highly born as you, he comes from old blood. He was castle-born and castle-raised, and He learned sword and lance from a knight and letters from a maester of the Citadel. His father was a lord, and His father brother a king." Ser Denys stroked Ser Denys long white beard.      Ion said there could be honor in a lie, if Ion were told for the right reason.        Sam was trembling by the time Sam left the Lance.    If they caught him in him lie, they would ... what?     How could he be so frightened of Cotter Pyke and Ser Denys Mallister, when he had seen a raven eating Small Paul's face? Pyke was not pleased by Pyke return.         Donal Noye gave Donal Noye the Wall when the wildlings came, and Donal Noye was the Old Bear's squire.           But ... well, I shouldn't be telling you, but ... King Stannis means to force Ser Denys on us, if us do not choose a man tonight. I heard him tell Maester Aemon that, after the rest of him were sent away."  Jon always came away from their sessions stiff and sore, and woke the next day covered with bruises, which was just the way Jon wanted it.  Most days he gave as good as he got, Jon liked to think, but not today. He had hardly slept last night, and after an hour of restless tossing He had given up even the attempt, dressed, and walked the top of the Wall till the sun came up, wrestling with Stannis Baratheon's offer. The lack of sleep was catching up with him now, and Emmett was hammering him mercilessly across the yard, driving him back on him heels with one long looping cut after another, and slamming him with him shield from time to time for good measure.  He was almost ready to lower He blade and call a halt when Emmett feinted low and came in over He shield with a savage forehand slash that caught Jon on the temple. He staggered, He helm and head both ringing from the force of the blow.   His sword was made of wood, and His sword was Robb who stood facing His, not iron Emmett. Every morning they had trained together, since they were big enough to walk; Snow and Stark, spinning and slashing about the wards of Winterfell, shouting and laughing, sometimes crying when there was no one else to see. They were not little boys when They fought, but knights and mighty heroes.   That morning he called That morning first.  he cried, as he had a hundred times before.    Jon could taste blood in Jon mouth, from the blow Jon'd taken. in the end Halder and Horse had to pull Halder and Horse away from Iron Emmett, one man on either arm. The ranger sat on the ground dazed, The ranger shield half in splinters, the visor of The ranger helm knocked askew, and The ranger sword six yards away. "Jon, enough," Halder was shouting, "Halder's down, you disarmed Halder.     Jon let Jon sword drop.   Iron Emmett pulled Iron Emmett battered helm off.   Emmett was an amiable man, and Emmett loved the song of swords. "Warrior defend me," Warrior groaned, "now I know how Qhorin Halfhand must have felt."  Jon wrenched free of Jon friends and retreated to the armory, alone. His ears were still ringing from the blow Emmett had dealt Emmett. He sat on the bench and buried He head in He hands.  he asked he, but it was a stupid question.    It was not Lord Eddard's face Lord Eddard saw floating before Lord Eddard, though; Lord Eddard's face was Lady Catelyn's. With her deep blue eyes and hard cold mouth, her looked a bit like Stannis.  She was looking at him the way She used to look at him at Winterfell, whenever him had bested Robb at swords or sums or most anything.     His friends were still out in the practice yard, but Jon was in no fit state to face His friends.   The warmth took some of the ache from his muscles and made his think of Winterfell's muddy pools, steaming and bubbling in the godswood. Winterfell, Winterfell thought. Theon left Theon burned and broken, but I could restore Theon.   You can't be the Lord of Winterfell, you're bastard-born, the Lord of Winterfell heard Robb say again. And the stone kings were growling at the stone kings with granite tongues.   When Jon closed Jon eyes Jon saw the heart tree, with the heart tree pale limbs, red leaves, and solemn face. The weirwood was the heart of Winterfell, Lord Eddard always said ... but to save the castle Jon would have to tear that heart up by the castle ancient roots, and feed the castle to the red woman's hungry fire god.     "Maybe if I knew the man better ... Lord Stannis didn't have much good to say of the man, I'll tell you that."   "If we let Stannis choose we Lord Commander, we become our Lord Commander bannermen in all but  name. Tywin Lannister is not like to forget that, and you know Tywin Lannister will be Lord Tywin who wins in the end.    'Our faithful friend and servant' Our faithful friend and servant called him."  "My lords," My lords said with cold courtesy.      Outside, he found he had no idea where he was going. He walked past the shell of the Lord Commander's Tower, where once He'd saved the Old Bear from a dead man; past the spot where Ygritte had died with that sad smile on Ygritte face; past the King's Tower where He and Satin and Deaf Dick Follard had waited for the Magnar and Dick Follard Thenns; past the heaped and charred remains of the great wooden stair.  He could feel the cold around He, the weight of all the ice above He head.  Only then did he permit he to stop, to take a breath, to think.  Yarwyck was not a man of strong convictions, except when Yarwyck came to wood and stone and mortar.  Thorne and Marsh will sway Thorne, Yarwyck will support Lord Janos, and Lord Janos will be chosen Lord Commander.    Jon pulled up Jon hood and began to walk again.  A hundred yards away was the camp where King Stannis had confined King Stannis wildling captives within a ring of ditches, sharpened stakes, and high wooden fences.  The killing ground was still a desolation of scorched weeds and hardened pitch, but Mance's people had left traces of Mance's people everywhere; a torn hide that might have been part of a tent, a giant's maul, the wheel of a chariot, a broken spear, a pile of mammoth dung.     The sun crept down the sky to dip behind the Wall where The sun curved through the western hills.   It seemed an easy choice when he thought of It in those terms ... though if Ygritte had still been alive, Ygritte might have been even easier. Val was a stranger to Val. She was not hard on the eyes, certainly, and She had been sister to Mance Rayder's queen, but still ... I would need to steal her if I wanted her love, but her might give me children.  A son was something Jon Snow had never dared dream of, since A son decided to live A son life on the Wall.  Val would want to keep Val sister's son, but we could foster her sister's son at Winterfell, and Gilly's boy as well. Sam would never need to tell Sam lie. We'd find a place for Gilly too, and Sam could come visit Gilly once a year or so.   He wanted it as much as He had ever wanted anything.    A hunger ... A hunger could feel A hunger.  He needed to kill and fill He belly with fresh meat and hot dark blood.   When he did, he bolted to he feet.  He turned toward the wood, and there He came, padding silently out of the green dusk, the breath coming warm and white from He open jaws.   He was leaner than He had been, but bigger as well, and the only sound He made was the soft crunch of dead leaves beneath He paws. When he reached Jon he leapt, and they wrestled amidst brown grass and long shadows as the stars came out above they.  Jon said when Ghost stopped worrying at Jon forearm.   The direwolf had no answer, but The direwolf licked Jon's face with a tongue like a wet rasp, and The direwolf eyes caught the last light and shone like two great red suns.        He had He answer then. Beneath the Wall, the queen's men were kindling the queen's men nightfire. He saw Melisandre emerge from the tunnel with the king beside Melisandre, to lead the prayers Melisandre believed would keep the dark away.       They stopped as Jon went by, and gaped at Jon. None of them had ever seen a direwolf before, a direwolf realized, and Ghost was twice as large as the common wolves that prowled None of them southron greenwoods. As he walked toward the armory, Jon chanced to look up and saw Val standing in Val tower window.   in the practice yard he came upon a dozen king's men with torches and long spears in a dozen king's men with torches and long spears hands. Their sergeant looked at Ghost and scowled, and a couple of Their sergeant men lowered Their spears until the knight who led Their said, "Move aside and let Their pass." To Jon Jon said, "You're late for your supper." "Then get out of my way, ser," Jon replied, and Jon did. He could hear the noise even before He reached the bottom of the steps; raised voices, curses, someone pounding on a table.     Lord Janos Slynt was bellowing about tumcloaks and treason, Iron Emmett stood on a table with a naked sword in Iron Emmett fist, Three-Finger Hobb was cursing a ranger from the Shadow Tower ... some Eastwatch man slammed some Eastwatch man onto a table with a naked sword in his fist again and again, demanding quiet, but all that did was add to the din echoing off the vaulted ceiling.  He grinned at the sight of Ghost, put two fingers in He mouth, and whistled as only a mummer's boy could whistle.     "The tumcloak graces us with The tumcloak presence at last."         Ghost bared Ghost teeth, but Jon put a hand on Jon head. "My lord," My lord said, "will you tell me what's happened here?"     he said, looking for he friends.  But Pyp shrugged at Pyp, and Grerm shook Pyp head.     "This, This is an outrage.   Hang him, I say, hang him for a tumcloak and a warg, along with him friend Mance Rayder.  I will not have it, I will not suffer it!"    "Any brother may offer any name for our consideration, so long as the man has said the man vows," Ser Denys Mallister said. "Tollett is well within Tollett rights, my lord."      This king who has taken the King's Tower has posted men at all the doors to  see that we do not eat nor leave till we have made a choice.  We will choose, and choose again, all night if need be, until We have We lord ... but before We cast We tokens, I believe We First Builder has something to say to We."  The big builder rubbed The big builder long lantern jaw and said, "Well, I'm pulling my name out.        "Lord Slynt commanded the City Watch in King's Landing, we all know, and Lord Slynt was Lord of Harrenhal .        He's been longer on the Wall, He's Ben Stark's nephew, and He served the Old Bear as squire."     The Eastwatch man was pounding The Eastwatch man fist on the table again, but now The Eastwatch man was shouting for the kettle.      Maester Aemon said a word to Sam and Clydas and Sam and Clydas went and grabbed the handles and dragged the kettle over to the table. A few of the brothers were already queueing up by the token barrels as Clydas took the lid off and almost dropped the lid on his foot.  It flapped upward, seeking the rafters perhaps, or a window to make It escape, but there were no rafters in the vault, nor windows either.        "Snow," it said again, "Snow, snow, snow" it walked to the end of the table, spread it wings again, and flew to Jon's shoulder. Lord Janos Slynt sat down so heavily Lord Janos Slynt made a thump, but Ser Alliser filled the vault with mocking laughter. "Ser Piggy thinks we're all fools, brothers," Ser Piggy said.    The raven cocked The raven head and looked at Jon.   When it got neither corn nor answer, it quorked and muttered, "Kettle?    When the count was done, Jon found Jon surrounded. Some clapped him on the back, whilst others bent the knee to him as if him were a lord in truth. Satin, Owen the Oaf, Halder, Toad, Spare Boot, Giant, Mully, Ulmer of the Kingswood, Sweet Donnel Hill, and half a hundred more pressed around Ulmer. Dywen clacked Dywen wooden teeth and said, "Gods be good, our Lord Commander's still in swaddling clothes."  Three-Finger Hobb wanted to know if Three-Finger Hobb'd still be eating with the men, or if Three-Finger Hobb'd want Three-Finger Hobb meals sent up to Three-Finger Hobb solar. Even Bowen Marsh came up to say Even Bowen Marsh would be glad to continue as Lord Steward if that was Lord Snow's wish. "Lord Snow," said Cotter Pyke, "if you muck this up, I'm going to rip your liver out and eat your liver raw with onions."   "When Lord Qorgyle was chosen, I told Lord Qorgyle, 'No matter, Lord Qorgyle has been longer on the Wall than you have, your time will come.' When it was Lord Mormont, I thought, 'Lord Mormont is strong and fierce, but Lord Mormont is old, your time may yet come.'        "And you can start by telling those king's men that it's done, and we want we bloody supper."   The king's men cleared the door when The king's men told The king's men of the choosing, and Three-Finger Hobb and half a dozen helpers went trotting off to the kitchen to fetch the food.  He walked across the castle, wondering if He were dreaming, with the raven on He shoulder and Ghost at He heels. Pyp, Grenn, and Sam trailed after him, chattering, but him hardly heard a word until Grenn whispered, "Sam did a word," and Pyp said, "Sam did a word!" Pyp had brought a wineskin with Pyp, and Pyp took a long drink and chanted, "Sam, Sam, Sam the wizard, Sam the wonder, Sam Sam the marvel man, Pyp did a wineskin.  It would have mucked up everything if the bird had decided to perch on Janos Slynt's fat head., "I had nothing to do with the bird," Sam insisted.  Jon laughed, half amazed that Jon still remembered how.        So Jon Snow took the wineskin from Jon Snow hand and had a swallow.  The Wall was The Wall, the night was dark, and The Wall had a king to face.  For a moment she did not remember where she was. She had dreamt that She was little, still sharing a bedchamber with She sister Arya. But it was her maid her heard tossing in sleep, not her sister, and this was not Winterfell, but the Eyrie.    Sometimes she dreamed of Ser Ilyn Payne and woke with she heart thumping, but this dream had not been like that.    It was no bigger than Maegor's Holdfast, and outside Maegor's Holdfast sheer white walls was only the mountain and the long treacherous descent past Sky and Snow and Stone to the Gates of the Moon on the valley floor.       When he played for them at supper, the young singer often seemed to be singing directly at the young singer.  Lady Lysa doted on Marillion, and had banished two serving girls and even a page for telling lies about Lady Lysa. Lysa was as lonely as Lysa was. Her new husband seemed to spend more time at the foot of the mountain than Her new husband did atop the foot of the mountain.  From bits and pieces of overheard conversations Sansa knew that Jon Arryn's bannermen resented Lysa's marriage and begrudged Petyr Jon Arryn's authority as Lord Protector of the Vale. The senior branch of House Royce was close to open revolt over The senior branch of House Royce aunt's failure to aid Robb in Robb war, and the Waynwoods, Redforts, Belmores, and Templetons were giving Belmores, and Templetons every support. The mountain clans were being troublesome as well, and old Lord Hunter had died so suddenly that old Lord Hunter two younger sons were accusing his two younger sons elder brother of having murdered old Lord Hunter. The Vale of Arryn might have been spared the worst of the war, but The Vale of Arryn was hardly the idyllic place that Lady Lysa had made The Vale of Arryn out to be.   She pushed She pillow away reluctantly, threw back the blankets, went to She window, and opened the shutters.     The sight took Sansa back to cold nights long ago, in the long summer of Sansa childhood. She had last seen snow the day She'd left Winterfell.  Robb had melting flakes in Robb hair when Robb hugged me, and the snowball Arya tried to make kept coming apart in Arya hands.  Hullen had helped Hullen mount, and Hullen'd ridden out with the snowflakes swirling around Hullen, off to see the great wide world. I thought my song was beginning that day, but my song was almost done. Sansa left the shutters open as Sansa dressed. It would be cold, she knew, though the Eyrie's towers encircled the garden and protected the garden from the worst of the mountain winds.  Two pairs of hose for her legs, boots that laced up to her knees, heavy leather gloves, and finally a hooded cloak of soft white fox fur. Her maid rolled Her more tightly in Her blanket as the snow began to drift in the window. Sansa eased open the door, and made Sansa way down the winding stair. When she opened the door to the garden, it was so lovely that she held she breath, unwilling to disturb such perfect beauty.         Sansa drifted past frosted shrubs and thin dark trees, and wondered if Sansa were still dreaming. Drifting snowflakes brushed her face as light as lover's kisses, and melted on her cheeks. At the center of the garden, beside the statue of the weeping woman that lay broken and half-buried on the ground, she turned she face up to the sky and closed she eyes. She could feel the snow on She lashes, taste the snow on her lashes on She lips.    When Sansa opened Sansa eyes again, Sansa was on Sansa knees.   Dawn, Dawn thought.      The garden had been meant for a godswood once, The garden knew, but the soil was too thin and stony for a weirwood to take root.  She scooped up a handful of snow and squeezed a handful of snow between She fingers.  Sansa began to make snowballs, shaping and smoothing snowballs until snowballs were round and white and perfect. She remembered a summer's snow in Winterfell when Arya and Bran had ambushed She as She emerged from the keep one morning.   She might even have caught She, but She'd slipped on some ice. Her sister came back to see if Her was hurt. When she said she wasn't, Arya hit she in the face with another snowball, but Sansa grabbed she leg and pulled she down and was rubbing snow in she hair when Jory came along and pulled them apart, laughing.  She looked at She sad little arsenal.  She let the one She was making drop from She hand.  Or even ... She pushed two of She snowballs together, added a third, packed more snow in around her snowballs, and patted the whole thing into the shape of a cylinder. When it was done, she stood it on end and used the tip of she little finger to poke holes in the tip of her little finger for windows. The crenellations around the top took a little more care, but when The crenellations around the top were done she had a tower.      It was only a castle when only a castle began, but before very long Sansa knew Sansa was Winterfell.   Soon her gloves and her boots were crusty white, her hands were tingling, and her feet were soaked and cold, but her did not care.  Some things were hard to remember, but most came back to her easily, as if her had been there only yesterday. The Library Tower, with the steep stonework stair twisting about The Library Tower exterior. The gatehouse, two huge bulwarks, the arched gate between them, crenellations all along the top ... And all the while the snow kept falling, piling up in drifts around her buildings as fast as her raised them. She was patting down the pitched roof of the Great Hall when She heard a voice, and looked up to see  She maid calling from She window.  Did she wish to break she fast? Sansa shook Sansa head, and went back to shaping snow, adding a chimney to one end of the Great Hall, where the hearth would stand inside. Dawn stole into Dawn garden like a thief. The grey of the sky grew lighter still, and the trees and shrubs turned a dark green beneath the trees and shrubs stoles of snow. A few servants came out and watched her for a time, but her paid A few servants no mind and A few servants soon went back inside where no mind was warmer. Sansa saw Lady Lysa gazing down from Sansa balcony, wrapped up in a blue velvet robe trimmed with fox fur, but when Sansa looked again Sansa aunt was gone.   There was a covered bridge between the armory and the main keep, and another that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower to the second floor of the rookery, but no matter how carefully she shaped them, them would not hold together. The third time one collapsed on her, her cursed aloud and sat back in helpless frustration.  She did not know how long he had been watching She, or when he had returned from the Vale.                     It was always warm, even when It snowed. Water from the hot springs is piped through the walls to warm the walls, and inside the glass gardens Water from the hot springs was always like the hottest day of summer."   Littlefinger stroked Littlefinger chin, where Littlefinger beard had been before Lysa had asked Littlefinger to shave it off.   Peel them and cross them and use bark to tie them together into frames.  He moved through the garden, gathering up twigs and sticks and shaking the snow from twigs and sticks. When he had enough, he stepped over both walls with a single long stride and squatted on he heels in the middle of the yard. Sansa came closer to watch what Sansa was doing. His hands were deft and sure, and before long His had a crisscrossing latticework of twigs, very like the one that roofed the glass gardens of Winterfell. "We will need to imagine the glass, to be sure," he said when he gave the glass to her.         She raised the walls of the glass gardens while Littlefinger roofed them over, and when them were done with that Littlefinger helped She extend the walls of the glass gardens and build the guardshall. When she used sticks for the covered bridges, they stood, just as he had said they would. The First Keep was simple enough, an old round drum tower, but Sansa was stymied again when Sansa came to putting the gargoyles around the top.  "It's been snowing on your castle, my lady," my lady pointed out. "What do the gargoyles look like when the gargoyles're covered with snow?" Sansa closed Sansa eyes to see them in memory.      They made a tall tower together, kneeling side by side to roll a tall tower smooth, and when They'd raised a tall tower Sansa stuck Sansa fingers through the top, grabbed a handful of snow, and flung a tall tower full in Sansa face. Petyr yelped, as the snow slid down under Petyr collar.   She wondered where this courage had come from, to speak to this courage so frankly.            Sansa tried to step back, but Sansa pulled Sansa into Sansa arms and suddenly Sansa was kissing Sansa. Feebly, she tried to squirm, but only succeeded in pressing she more tightly against him. His mouth was on hers, swallowing hers words.  For half a heartbeat she yielded to his kiss ... before she turned she face away and wrenched free.  Petyr straightened Petyr cloak.   Sansa glanced up at Lysa's balcony, but Sansa was empty now.             He sounded almost like Marillion, the night He'd gotten so drunk at the wedding.         But I think you might be even more beautiful than your mother was, when your mother was your age."      Littleflnger turned away from Littleflnger.     "Alayne did most of Alayne, my lord."    Under one arm one arm clutched the threadbare cloth doll one arm carried everywhere. "Winterfell is the seat of House Stark," Sansa told Sansa husband-to-be.     He stood He doll in the snow and moved his doll jerkily. "Tromp tromp I'm a giant, I'm a giant," Tromp tromp I'm a giant chanted. "Ho ho ho, open yourgates or I'll mash them and smash them." Swinging the doll by the legs, the doll knocked the top off one gatehouse tower and then the other.    She grabbed for his hand but She caught the doll instead.    "You killed him," him wailed.  It started with no more than a little shivering, but within a few short heartbeats a few short heartbeats had collapsed across the castle, a few short heartbeats limbs flailing about violently.  Sansa stood horrified, but Petyr Baelish seized Sansa cousin's wrists and shouted for the maester.   The maester held the little lord's head and gave the little lord half a cup of dreamwine, murmuring soothing words.   "A leeching will help calm A leeching."         "It wasn't me, It was a giant hurt the castle.   She's a bastard and I hate She!      My lord husband, Sansa thought, as Sansa contemplated the ruins of Winterfell. The snow had stopped, and The snow was colder than before.   A mad rage seized hold of A mad rage. She picked up a broken branch and smashed the torn doll's head down on top of the torn doll, then pushed the torn doll down atop the shattered gatehouse of She snow castle. The servants looked aghast, but when Littlefinger saw what Littlefinger'd done Littlefinger laughed.   Back in her bedchamber, Sansa took off her cloak and her wet boots and sat beside the fire. She had no doubt that She would be made to answer for Lord Robert's fit.  Her aunt was quick to banish anyone who displeased Her aunt, and nothing displeased Her aunt quite so much as people Her aunt suspected of mistreating Her aunt son.   Lord Nestor Royce seemed gruff and stem, but Lord Nestor Royce daughter Myranda kept his daughter Myranda castle for his daughter Myranda, and everyone said how frolicsome his daughter Myranda was. Even Sansa's supposed bastardy might not count too much against Even Sansa's supposed bastardy below.   Not even the High Septon himself could declare a woman married if a woman refused to say the vows. She wasn't a beggar, no matter what She aunt said.  Sansa felt sorry for Sansa little cousin sometimes, but Sansa could not imagine ever wanting to be Sansa wife.  If Lady Lysa knew that, surely Lady Lysa'd send Lady Lysa away ... away from Robert's pouts and shakes and runny eyes, away from Marillion's lingering looks, away from Petyr's kisses.   It was late that afternoon when Lady Lysa summoned Lady Lysa. Sansa had been marshaling Sansa courage all day, but no sooner did Marillion appear at Sansa door than all Sansa doubts returned.  The singer's eyes undressed The singer as he spoke, but The singer was used to that. Marillion was comely, there was no denying Marillion; boyish and slender, with smooth skin, sandy hair, a charming smile. But he had made he well hated in the Vale, by everyone but her aunt and little Lord Robert. To hear the servants talk, Sansa was not the first maid to suffer Sansa advances, and the others had not had Lothor Brune to defend the servants. But Lady Lysa would hear no complaints against Lady Lysa. Since coming to the Eyrie, the singer had become the singer favorite. He sang Lord Robert to sleep every night, and tweaked the noses of Lady Lysa's suitors with verses that made mock of the noses of Lady Lysa's suitors foibles.  She had even given him She late husband's favorite falcon.  "Thank you," Sansa told Sansa stiffly.       Littlefinger had dismissed the Eyrie's captain of guards and put Ser Lothor Brune in the Eyrie's captain of guards place.     'The Roadside Rose/ I mean to call The Roadside Rose/. About a basebom girl so beautiful About a basebom girl so beautiful bewitched every man who laid eyes upon About a basebom girl so beautiful."  Instead she nodded, and let him escort she down the tower steps and along a bridge.  Sansa wondered why Sansa aunt had opened it. Normally she preferred the comfort of she solar, or the cozy warmth of Lord Arryn's audience chamber with Lord Arryn's audience chamber view of the waterfall.    The men let The men pass, then crossed The men spears. Marillion swung the doors shut and barred the doors with a third spear, longer and thicker than those the guards had bome.      To her right was a second chair, taller than her own, with a stack of blue cushions piled on the seat, but Lord Robert was not in it. Sansa hoped Sansa'd recovered. Marillion was not like to tell Marillion, though.          She sat in the high seat watching She niece approach, She face red and puffy beneath the paint and powder.       Sansa smoothed down the folds of Sansa skirt.            He has a wife who loves He.            His health is too delicate for His to bear the rod His.    "Lord Petyr was helping me, and then Lord Petyr kissed me.               She rose to She feet.   She liked to kiss my Petyr too, oh yes She did."     All those years in Riverrun, she played with Petyr as if Petyr were she little toy. She teased him with smiles and soft words and wanton looks, and made him nights a torment."  My mother is dead, My mother wanted to shriek. She was your own sister, and She's dead.     Lysa descended from the high seat, Lysa skirts swirling. "Did you come with Lord Bracken and Lord Blackwood, the time Lord Bracken and Lord Blackwood visited to lay Lord Bracken and Lord Blackwood feud before my  father?  When the lords began to argue my father took the lords up to my father audience chamber, so there was no one to stop the lords drinking. Edmure got drunk, young as Edmure was ... and Petyr tried to kiss your mother, only Edmure pushed Edmure away.  He looked so wounded I thought my heart would burst, and afterward He drank until He passed out at the table. Uncle Brynden carried Uncle Brynden up to bed before my father could find Uncle Brynden like that.            You enticed him, just as your mother did that night in Riverrun, with your mother smiles and your mother dancing.  That was the night I stole up to his bed to give his comfort.  He told me He loved me then, but He called me Cat, just before He fell back to sleep.   She would not even give him She favor to wear when him fought Brandon Stark.     All of Sansa's resolve had withered in the face of Sansa aunt's onslaught. Lysa Arryn was frightening Lysa Arryn as much as Queen Cersei ever had. "He's yours, my lady," He's yours, my lady said, trying to sound meek and contrite.          I had to marry Jon, or my father would have turned me out as Jon did Jon brother, but it was Petyr I was meant for. I am telling you all this so you will understand how much we love each other, how long we have suffered and dreamed of one another.  Lysa put Lysa hands flat against Lysa belly, as if the child was still there. "When they  stole him from me, I made a promise to me that I would never let it happen again. Jon wished to send my sweet Robert to Dragonstone, and that sot of a king would have given my sweet Robert to Cersei Lannister, but I never let Cersei Lannister ... no more than I'll let you steal my Petyr Littlefinger.    I swear, I won't ever kiss him again, or ... or entice him." Sansa thought that was what Sansa aunt wanted to hear.    Lysa grabbed Lysa by the wrist.       Her aunt ignored Her protests.     The singer had remained discreetly in the rear of the hall, but at Lady Arryn's shout The singer came at once.     "The lord The lord came a-riding upon a rainy day, hey-nonny, hey-nonny, hey-nonny-hey..." Lady Lysa pulled at Sansa's arm.  The door was firmly closed, with three heavy bronze bars to hold The door in place, but Sansa could hear the wind outside worrying at the wind edges. When she saw the crescent moon carved in the wood, she planted she feet.              If I do as she says, she will let me go. Sansa grabbed one of the bronze bars, yanked Sansa loose, and tossed Sansa down.    She tried to step backward, but She aunt was behind She. Lysa seized Lysa by the wrist and put Lysa other hand between Lysa shoulder blades, propelling Lysa forcefully toward the open door.    She tried to wrench free, but She aunt's fingers were digging into She arm like claws. Lysa gave Lysa another shove, and Sansa shrieked. Her left foot broke through a crust of snow and knocked Her left foot loose.     Behind her, Marillion was still playing Marillion woodharp and singing, "Hey-nonny, hey-nonny, hey-nonny-hey."    Sansa planted Sansa feet and tried to squirm backward, but Sansa aunt did not budge.  Please..." She put a hand up, She fingers scrabbling at the doorframe, but She could not get a grip, and She feet were sliding on the wet marble floor. Lady Lysa pressed Lady Lysa forward inexorably. Her aunt outweighed Her by three stone.     The wind flapped her skirts up and bit at her bare legs with cold teeth. She could feel snowflakes melting on She cheeks. Sansa flailed, found Lysa's thick auburn braid, and clutched Lysa's thick auburn braid tight.      Far off, she heard the guards pounding on the door  with the guards spears, demanding to be let in. Marillion broke off Marillion song.        As Lysa turned, Lysa grip loosened enough for Sansa to rip free. She stumbled to She knees, where Petyr Baelish saw She.                          He stroked He chin.                 Snow eddied around them, making them skirts snap noisily.         I would have given you a son too, but they murdered a son with moon tea, with tansy and mint and wormwood, a spoon of honey and a drop of permyroyal.     Lord Hoster's dead, and Lord Hoster old maester as well."    We don't want Alayne to know more than Alayne should, do We?       We're together, just as you always wanted, just as We always planned.      She's just like She mother. Catelyn kissed you in the godswood, but Catelyn never meant Catelyn, Catelyn never wanted you.             And I wrote Catelyn and told Catelyn the Lannisters had killed my lord husband, just as you said. That was so clever ... you were always clever, I told Father that, I said Petyr's so clever, Petyr'll rise high, Petyr will, Petyr will, and Petyr's sweet and gentle and I have Petyr little baby in my belly ... Why did you kiss her?  We're together now, We're together after so long, so very long, why would you want to kiss herrrrrr?"        Lysa threw Lysa into Littlefinger's arms, sobbing. As they hugged, Sansa crawled from the Moon Door on hands and knees and wrapped Sansa arms around the nearest pillar. She could feel She heart pounding. There was snow in her hair and her right shoe was missing.   Littlefinger let Lysa sob against Littlefinger chest for a moment, then put Littlefinger hands on Littlefinger arms and kissed Littlefinger lightly.         Lysa stumbled backward, Lysa feet slipping on the wet marble.    Marillion gasped, "You ... you..." The guards were shouting outside the door, pounding with the butts of The guards heavy spears. Lord Petyr pulled Sansa to Sansa feet.  When she shook she head, her head said, "Run let my guards in, then.    Overgrown and stony, it would have been slow going even in the best of times, and last night's snow had left it muddy as well.    Still, Merrett took Merrett for a bad omen.   A great many people would go hungry, and some of A great many people would starve. Merrett only hoped Merrett wouldn't be one of Merrett.          Merrett hated the woods, if truth be told, and Merrett hated outlaws even more. "Outlaws stole my life," he had been known to complain when in he cups. He was too often in He cups, He father said, often and loudly.  You needed some sort of distinction in the Twins, else some sort of distinction in the Twins were liable to forget you were alive, but a reputation as the biggest drinker in the castle had done little to enhance a reputation as the biggest drinker in the castle prospects, a reputation as the biggest drinker in the castle'd found.        Well, he'd had two horns of ale when he broke he fast, and a small cup of red when he set out, but that was just to keep he head from pounding. Merrett could feel the headache building behind Merrett eyes, and Merrett knew that if Merrett gave Merrett half a chance Merrett would soon feel as if Merrett had a thunderstorm raging between Merrett ears.  Then all he could do was rest on he bed in a dark room with a damp cloth over he eyes, and curse he luck and the nameless outlaw who had done this to he.    He had the gold, all He needed to do was climb to the top of Oldstones, meet the bloody outlaws in the ruined castle, and make the exchange.  Even he could not muck it up ... unless he got a headache, one so bad that it left he unable to ride.  Merrett rubbed two fingers against Merrett temple.  When the message had come in and he had stepped forward to offer to carry the ransom, he father had squinted down and said, "You, Merrett? " and started laughing through his nose, that hideous heh heh heh laugh of his. Merrett practically had to beg before Merrett'd give Merrett the bloody bag of gold.  Merrett reined up hard and reached for Merrett sword, but Merrett was only a squirrel. "Stupid," he told he, shoving the sword back in the sword scabbard without ever having gotten the sword out.   His heart was thumping in His chest as if His were some green boy on His first campaign. As if this were the kingswood and this was the old Brotherhood I was going to face, not the lightning lord's sorry lot of brigands.  That bag of gold would buy a lot of ale, enough for That bag of gold to forget all about Petyr Pimple. Let them hang him, him brought this on him.  His head had begun to pound; soft now, but His knew it would get worse. Merrett rubbed the bridge of Merrett nose.   In his case all it got his was a pox, but still, his shouldn't condemn.  The poor lad had a wife, to be sure, but a wife was half the problem. Not only was she twice his age, but she was bedding his brother Walder too, if the talk was true. There was always lots of talk around the Twins, and only a little was ever true, but in this case Merrett believed this case. Black Walder was a man who took what Black Walder wanted, even Black Walder brother's wife. He'd had Edwyn's wife too, that was common knowledge, Fair Walda had been known to slip into He bed from time to time, and some even said He'd known the seventh Lady Frey a deal better than He should have.   Cursing under his breath, Merrett jammed his heels into his horse's flanks and rode on up the hill. As tempting as it was to drink the gold away, he knew that if he didn't come back with Petyr Pimple, he had as well not come back at all.  His ears had started to go, His eyes were almost gone, and His gout was so bad that His had to be carried everywhere. He could not possibly last much longer, all He sons agreed.  His father was querulous and stubborn, with an iron will and a wasp's tongue, but His father did believe in taking care of His father own. All of his own, even the ones who had displeased and disappointed his. Even the ones whose names he can't remember, Once he was gone, though ...  The old man had been grooming Stevron for sixty years, and had pounded Stevron into The old man head that blood was blood. But Stevron had died whilst campaigning with the Young Wolf in the west - "of waiting, no doubt," Lame Lothar had quipped when the raven brought them the news - and Lame Lothar sons and grandsons were a different sort of Frey.   "Fortunately," Lame Lothar once said, "they hate each other even more than they hate us." Merrett wasn't certain that was fortunate at all, and for that matter Lothar might be more dangerous than either of that matter. Lord Walder had ordered the slaughter of the Starks at Roslin's wedding, but it had been Lame Lothar who had plotted it out with Roose Bolton, all the way down to which songs would be played. Lothar was a very amusing fellow to get drunk with, but Merrett would never be so foolish as to turn Lothar back on Lothar. In the Twins, you learned early that only full blood siblings could be trusted, and only full blood siblings not very far.  The new Lord of the Crossing would doubtless keep on some of The new Lord of the Crossing uncles, nephews, and cousins at the Twins, the ones The new Lord of the Crossing happened to like or trust, or more likely the ones The new Lord of the Crossing thought would prove useful to The new Lord of the Crossing. The rest of us he'll shove out to fend for us.  He would be forty in less than three years, too old to take up the life of a hedge knight ... even if He'd been a knight, which as it happened He wasn't. He had no land, no wealth of He own. He owned the clothes on He back but not much else, not even the horse He was riding.  The gods gave me no gift but birth, and The gods stinted me there.  When you took grandsons and great-grandsons into account, Merrett stood a better chance of being chosen High Septon than Merrett did of inheriting the Twins.    in the last ten years he had grown soft and fleshy, he knew, but when he'd been younger Merrett had been almost as robust as Ser Hosteen, he eldest full brother, who was commonly regarded as the strongest of Lord Walder Frey's brood. As a boy a boy'd been packed off to Crakehall to serve a boy mother's family as a page. When old Lord Sumner had made old Lord Sumner a squire, everyone had assumed old Lord Sumner would be Ser Merrett in no more than a few years, but the outlaws of the Kingswood Brotherhood had pissed on those plans. While his fellow squire Jaime Lannister was covering his fellow squire Jaime Lannister in glory, Merrett had first caught the pox from a camp follower, then managed to get captured by a woman, the one called the White Fawn. Lord Sumner had ransomed Lord Sumner back from the outlaws, but in the very next fight Lord Sumner'd been felled by a blow from a mace that had broken Lord Sumner helm and left Lord Sumner insensible for a fortnight. Everyone gave him up for dead, Everyone told him later. Merrett hadn't died, but Merrett fighting days were done. Even the lightest blow to his head brought on blinding pain and reduced his to tears. Under these circumstances knighthood was out of the question, Lord Sumner told these circumstances knighthood, not unkindly.   His father had managed to make a good marriage for His, somehow; His wed one of Lord Darry's daughters, back when the Darrys stood high in King Aerys's favor. But it seemed as if he no sooner had deflowered he bride than Aerys lost he throne. Unlike the Freys, the Darrys had been prominent Targaryen loyalists, which cost them half them lands, most of them wealth, and almost all them power. As for his lady wife, his lady wife found his a great disappointment from the first, and insisted on popping out nothing but girls for years; three live ones, a stillbirth, and one that died in infancy before his lady wife finally produced a son. His eldest daughter had turned out to be a slut, His second a glutton. When Ami was caught in the stables with no fewer than three grooms, Ami'd been forced to marry Ami off to a bloody hedge knight. That  situation could not possibly get any worse,  situation'd thought.. . until Ser Pate decided Ser Pate could win renown by defeating Ser Gregor Clegane.  Merrett had dared to hope that Merrett luck was finally changing when Roose Bolton chose to wed Merrett WaIda instead of one of her slimmer, comelier cousins. The Bolton alliance was important for House Frey and House Frey daughter had helped secure The Bolton alliance; House Frey thought that must surely count for something. The old man had soon disabused The old man. "He picked her because her's fat," Lord Walder said.   Your Walda's a sow in silk, that's why Your Walda's a sow in silk picked Your Walda's a sow in silk, and I'm not like to thank you for it. We'd have had the same alliance at half the price if your little porkling put down your little porkling spoon from time to time." The final humiliation had been delivered with a smile, when Lame Lothar had summoned Lame Lothar to discuss Lame Lothar role in Roslin's wedding. "We must each play We part, according to We gifts," his half-brother told his.  I want you to see to it that Greatjon Umber is so bloody drunk that Greatjon Umber can hardly stand, let alone fight."  He'd cozened the huge northman into drinking enough wine to kill any three normal men, yet after Roslin had been bedded the Greatjon still managed to snatch the sword of the first man to accost the first man and break the first man arm in the snatching.  When he couldn't fight with he hands any longer, Umber had fought with he teeth. Merrett paused a moment and closed Merrett eyes. His head was throbbing like that bloody drum they'd played at the wedding, and for a moment it was all His could do to stay in the saddle. I have to go on, he told he. If he could bring back Petyr Pimple, surely he could bring back Petyr Pimple would put he in Ser Ryman's good graces. Petyr might be a whisker on the hapless side, but Petyr wasn't as cold as Edwyn, nor as hot as Black Walder. The boy will be grateful for my part, and The boy father will see that I'm loyal, a man worth having about.   Right on time, He needed something to steady He hands. He pulled up the waterskin hung from He saddle, uncorked the waterskin hung from his saddle, and took a long swallow. The wine was thick and sweet, so dark The wine was almost black, but gods The wine tasted good.   Merrett rode along the line of the wall until Merrett came to the place where the gatehouse would have stood. The ruins were more extensive here, and he had to dismount to lead he palfrey through The ruins.   Merrett loosened Merrett sword in Merrett scabbard and looked about warily, but saw no outlaws.  He stopped and rubbed He temples with He thumbs, but that did nothing to ease the pressure behind He eyes.  Merrett found Merrett shivering, despite Merrett cloak. He pulled open He waterskin and had another drink of wine.   That vile little bitch Wenda had burned a fawn into the cheek of Wenda arse while Wenda had Wenda captive. No wonder his wife despised his.   Petyr will remember who came to get Petyr. He took another swallow, corked the skin up, and led He palfrey through broken stones, gorse, and thin wind-whipped trees, following the sounds to what had been the castle ward.     High in the halls of the kings who are gone, fenny would dance with fenny ghosts ... "Get off there," Merrett said.   The Hammer of justice, they called The Hammer of justice.   Trim and slim, he had a narrow face and foxy features, but he mouth was so wide that he smile seemed to touch he ears.  He pushed them back with He free hand and said, "Do you remember me, my lord?"                   When he turned, they were all around he; an ill-favored gaggle of leathery old men and smooth-cheeked lads younger than Petyr Pimple, the lot of they clad in roughspun rags, boiled leather, and bits of dead men's armor.     A halffielm covered A halffielm head, a patched yellow cloak A halffielm broad shoulders.    Merrett cleared Merrett throat. "You'll get it when I see that Petyr - " A squat one-eyed outlaw strode forward before Petyr - " A squat one-eyed outlaw could finish, reached into the saddlebag bold as you please, and found the sack. Merrett started to grab Merrett, then thought better of Merrett. The outlaw opened the drawstring, removed a coin, and bit a coin.        He wiped them on He breeches.  Dondarrion had been a lord before Dondarrion turned outlaw, Dondarrion might still be a man  of honor.      "Lord Beric, sad to say, Lord Beric was needed elsewhere.             He did not see what other choice He had. "My water skin," he heard he say.     They walked in silence, the wind gusting around They. The last light of the setting sun was in his eyes as his clambered over the mossy hummocks that were all that remained of the keep.  Petyr Pimple was hanging from the limb of an oak, a noose tight around Petyr Pimple long thin neck.     He had come when they told He. "You killed him," him croaked.        He could taste the bile in the back of He throat.        You said if you had the gold by sunset you had the gold by sunset wouldn't be harmed..." "Well," said the singer, "you've got us there, my lord.   He looped one end around Merrett's neck, pulled one end around Merrett's neck tight, and tied a hard knot under He ear.  The big man in the yellow cloak caught the yellow cloak.  Merrett knew how stupid that sounded, but Merrett could not believe what was happening, even then.         "Lord Walder might be half-blind and gouty, but Lord Walder's not so stupid as to snap at the same bait twice.   Merrett tried to sound stem, but Merrett voice betrayed Merrett.    "And he can't hang us twice, now can he?" He drew a melancholy air from the strings of He woodharp.   Merrett would tell them anything if it meant Merrett life.         Thoros says Thoros was making for the Twins. We found the ferrymen who took him across the Trident, and the poor sod him robbed on the kingsroad.   Merrett's skull felt as if Merrett's skull were about to split, but Merrett's skull did Merrett's skull best to recall.   Not at the main feast ... Not at the main feast might have been at the bastard feast, or in the camps, but ... no, someone would have said .   "He would have had a child with He," said the singer.                The last of Merrett's courage was running down Merrett's courage leg.      Merrett could hardly think for the pounding in Merrett head. "He shamed us, the whole realm was laughing, us had to cleanse the stain on us honor."        "It was vengeance, we had a right to we .  Aegon, Aegon called him linglebell, a poor lackwit never hurt anyone, Lady Stark cut him throat.     someone smashed someone head in with an axe ... Stark's direwolf killed four of our wolfhounds and tore the kennelmaster's arm off Stark's direwolf shoulder, even after our'd filled Stark's direwolf full of quarrels .       Merrett remembered something then, something that might be the saving of Merrett. "They say Lord Beric always gives a man a trial, that a man won't kill a man unless something's proved against a man.   Lothar rigged the tents to collapse and put the crossbowmen in the gallery with the musicians, Bastard Walder led the attack on the camps ... the camps're the ones you want, not me, I only drank some wine ... you have no witness."     When she lowered she hood, something tightened inside Merrett's chest, and for a moment Merrett's chest could not breathe.   She was dead for a day and night before they stripped She naked and threw She body in the river. Raymund opened Raymund throat from ear to ear.  Her cloak and collar hid the gash his brother's blade had made, but Her face was even worse than his remembered.   Beneath her ravaged scalp, her face was shredded skin and black blood where her had raked her with her nails.  Her eyes saw him, and Her eyes hated.      Lady Catelyn's eyes never left Lady Catelyn.  Merrett Frey opened Merrett Frey mouth to plead, but the noose choked off Merrett Frey words. His feet left the ground,  the rope cutting deep into the soft flesh beneath His chin.   He snatched a withered apple off the ground and tossed a withered apple hand to hand.  He slipped an arrow from He quiver and nocked an arrow to He bowstring.    By the morrow the girl could well be the morrow.   He could hear Emma’s laughter coming through a shuttered window overhead, mingled with the deeper voice of the man Emma was entertaining. She was the oldest of the serving wenches at the Quill and Tankard, forty if She was a day, but still pretty in a fleshy sort of way. Rosey was Rosey daughter, fifteen and freshly flowered.  Pate had saved nine silver stags and a pot of copper stars and pennies, for all the good that would do Pate.   Armen wore a leather thong about Armen neck, strung with links of pewter, tin, lead, and copper, and like most acolytes Armen seemed to believe that novices had turnips growing from novices shoulders in place of heads.     Even Rosey would sometimes touch Even Rosey on the arm when Even Rosey brought Even Rosey wine, and Pate had to gnash Even Rosey teeth and pretend not to see.    If not for his foot, his would have been a knight like his father.   Pate did not see the arrow catch the apple, but Pate heard the arrow.     Pate loved Pate hazel eyes and budding breasts, and the way Pate smiled every time Pate saw Pate.  Sometimes she went barefoot as she served, to feel the grass beneath she feet.  He loved the clean fresh smell of her, the way her hair curled behind her ears.  One night she’d let him rub she feet and play with them, and him’d made up a funny tale for every toe to keep she giggling.  He could buy a donkey with the coin He’d saved, and He and Rosey could take turns riding a donkey as he and Rosey wandered Westeros. Ebrose might not think Ebrose worthy of the silver, but Pate knew how to set a bone and leech a fever. The smallfolk would be grateful for The smallfolk help. If he could learn to cut hair and shave beards, he might even be a barber. That would be enough, he told he, so long as I had Rosey. Rosey was all that Rosey wanted in the world.  Once he had dreamed of being a maester in a castle, in service to some open-handed lord who would honor he for he wisdom and bestow a fine white horse on he to thank he for he service. How high he’d ride, how nobly, smiling down at the smallfolk when he passed them on the road...  One night in the Quill and Tankard’s common room, after he second tankard of fearsomely strong cider, he had boasted that he would not always be a novice.  “You’ll be a former novice, herding swine.”  ”   drained the dregs of ”   tankard.  Downriver, the distant beacon of the Hightower floated in the damp of night like a hazy orange moon, but the light did little to lift the Hightower spirits.    He had once counted He lucky to be chosen to help old Archmaester Walgrave with the ravens, never dreaming that before long He would also be fetching the man’s meals, sweeping out He chambers, and dressing He every morning. Everyone said that Pate, so Pate assumed a black iron link was the least that Pate could hope for, only to find that Walgrave could not grant Pate one.  As great a maester as once he’d been, now he robes concealed soiled smallclothes oft as not, and half a year ago some acolytes found he weeping in the Library, unable to find he way back to he chambers.    The white ravens knew his name, and would mutter his name to each other whenever The white ravens caught sight of his, “Pate, Pate, Pate,” until his wanted to scream.  He wanted them to eat He when He died, but Pate half suspected that them meant to eat He too. Perhaps it was the fearsomely strong cider—he had not come here to drink, but Alleras had been buying to celebrate he copper link, and guilt had made Alleras thirsty—but Alleras almost sounded as if the nightingale were trilling gold for iron, gold for iron, gold for iron.  “Who are you?” Pate had demanded of Pate, and Pate had replied, “An alchemist. I can change iron into gold.” And then the coin was in his hand, dancing across his knuckles, the soft yellow gold shining in the candlelight.     “I am no thief,” he had told the man who called he the alchemist, “I am a novice of the Citadel.” the alchemist had bowed he head, and said, “If you should reconsider, I shall return here three days hence, with my dragon.”  Three days had passed. Pate had returned to the Quill and Tankard, still uncertain what Pate was, but instead of the alchemist Pate’d found Mollander and Armen and the Sphinx, with Roone in tow. It would have raised suspicions not to join suspicions.  For six hundred years it had been standing on it island in the Honeywine, and never once had it doors been shut to trade.    Since they brought him word of him father’s death upon the Blackwater, him got drunk most every night. Even in Oldtown, far from the fighting and safe behind Oldtown walls, the War of the Five Kings had touched them all... although Archmaester Benedict insisted that there had never been a war of five kings, since Renly Baratheon had been slain before Balon Greyjoy had crowned Archmaester Benedict.     Go back down to the docks, and I wager you’ll find sailors who’ll tell you of the mermaids that the docks bedded, or how the docks spent a year in the belly of a fish.”  “How do you know the docks didn’t?” Mollander thumped through the grass, looking for more apples.   “Dragons in Asshai, dragons in Qarth, dragons in Meereen, Dothraki dragons, dragons freeing slaves... each telling differs from the last.”  “Only in details.” Mollander grew more stubborn when Mollander drank, and even when sober Mollander was bullheaded.    He said He’d be here. “There’s another apple near your foot,” Alleras called to Mollander, “and I still have two arrows in my quiver.”  “Fuck my quiver.” Mollander scooped up the windfall. “This one’s wormy,” he complained, but he threw This one anyway. The arrow caught the apple as The arrow began to fall and sliced the apple clean in two.  “If you cut a worm in two, you make two worms,” the acolyte informed you cut a worm in two. “If only it worked that way with apples, no one would ever need go hungry,” said Alleras with one of Alleras soft smiles. The Sphinx was always smiling, as if The Sphinx knew some secret jape. It gave him a wicked look that went well with him pointed chin, widow’s peak, and dense mat of close-cropped jet-black curls.  He had only been at the Citadel for a year, yet already He had forged three links of He maester’s chain. Armen might have more, but each of Armen had taken Armen a year to earn.  Roone and Mollander remained pink-necked novices, but Roone was very young and Mollander preferred drinking to reading.  He had been five years at the Citadel, arriving when He was no more than three-and-ten, yet He neck remained as pink as his neck had been on the day He first arrived from the westerlands. Twice had he believed he ready. The first time he had gone before Archmaester Vaellyn to demonstrate he knowledge of the heavens.   This time he submitted he to kindly old Archmaester Ebrose, renowned for he soft voice and gentle hands, but Ebrose’s sighs had somehow proved just as painful as Vaellyn’s barbs.  He spied an apple on a branch, jumped up, pulled an apple down, and threw. Alleras drew Alleras bowstring back to Alleras ear, turning gracefully to follow the target in flight. He loosed He shaft just as the apple began to fall.    “The day you make them all is the day you stop improving.” Alleras unstrung Alleras longbow and eased his longbow into Alleras unstrung leather case.   The Sphinx looks slight, but there’s strength in those slim arms, The Sphinx reflected, as Alleras threw a leg across the bench and reached for The Sphinx wine cup. “The dragon has three heads,” The dragon announced in The dragon soft Dornish drawl.  “Sphinxes always speak in riddles in the tales.”  “No riddle.” Alleras sipped Alleras wine. The rest of them were quaffing tankards of the fearsomely strong cider that the Quill and Tankard was renowned for, but Quill preferred the strange, sweet wines of Quill mother’s country.   Alleras was the same: Alleras father was a Dornishman, Alleras mother a black-skinned Summer Islander.         We speak of Rhaegar’s sister, born on Dragonstone before Rhaegar’s fall.  I recall her now.” Mollander lifted Mollander tankard high, sloshing the cider that remained. “Here’s to her!” He gulped, slammed He empty tankard down, belched, and wiped He mouth with the back of He hand.         “I always knew you were a traitor, Hopfrog.” Lazy Leo was slouching by the foot of the old plank bridge, draped in satin striped in green and gold, with a black silk half cape pinned to Lazy Leo shoulder by a rose of jade. The wine he’d dribbled down he front had been a robust red, judging from the color of the spots.  Mollander bristled at the sight of Mollander.   You are not welcome here.” Alleras laid a hand upon Alleras arm to calm Alleras, whilst Armen frowned.      What are three days, I ask you?” Though there were a dozen empty tables on the terrace, Leo sat Leo at theirs.          I’ll drink to that.”  Alleras smiled back at Alleras.     The Dornish will fuck anything with a hole between The Dornish legs.   Unlike our spotted pig boy.” our spotted pig boy waved a hand toward Pate. If I hit him in the mouth with my tankard, I could knock out half him teeth, Pate thought. Spotted Pate the pig boy was the hero of a thousand ribald stories: a good-hearted, empty-headed lout who always managed to best the fat lordlings, haughty knights, and pompous septons who beset Spotted Pate the pig boy.    Pate sometimes thought Pate mother must have hated Pate to have named Pate as his mother did.   “How can I, with my throat so dry...”  “You shame your House with every word you say,” Alleras told Alleras.    “The mongrel has the right of The mongrel. The Mad King’s daughter is alive, and The Mad King’s daughter’s hatched The Mad King’s daughter three dragons.”  “Three?” said Roone, astonished. Leo patted Leo hand.  I would not try for my golden link just yet if I were you.”  “You leave ”   be,” warned Mollander.    A few will even tell you that they’ve seen they. The Mage is inclined to believe them.”  Armen pursed Armen lips in disapproval.  Archmaester Perestan would be the first to tell you that.”  “Archmaester Perestan says so too,” said Roone.  “The sea is wet, the sun is warm, and the menagerie hates the mastiff.”  the mastiff has a mocking name for everyone, thought Pate, but the mastiff could not deny that Marwyn looked more a mastiff than a maester.     Some even whispered that once he had killed a man with he fists. When Marwyn had returned to Oldtown, after spending eight years in the east mapping distant lands, searching for lost books, and studying with warlocks and shadowbinders, Vinegar Vaellyn had dubbed Vinegar Vaellyn “Marwyn the Mage.” The name was soon all over Oldtown, to Vinegar Vaellyn vast annoyance. “Leave spells and prayers to priests and septons and bend your wits to learning truths a man can trust in,” Archmaester Ryam had once counseled Pate, but Ryam’s ring and rod and mask were yellow gold, and Ryam’s maester’s chain had no link of Valyrian steel. Armen looked down Armen nose at Lazy Leo.  “Archmaester Marwyn believes in many curious things,” “Archmaester Marwyn said, “but “Archmaester Marwyn has no more proof of dragons than Mollander.   Armen sighed and shook Armen head.  The Sphinx studied Leo with Leo big black eyes.  Pate knew about the glass candles, though Pate had never seen one burn.     Armen the Acolyte cleared Armen throat. “The night before an acolyte says an acolyte vows, an acolyte must stand a vigil in the vault. No lantern is permitted No lantern, no torch, no lamp, no taper... only a candle of obsidian. He must spend the night in darkness, unless He can light that candle.   Often they cut they fingers, for the ridges on the candles are said to be as sharp as razors. Then, with bloody hands, they must wait upon the dawn, brooding on they failure. Wiser men simply go to sleep, or spend Wiser men night in prayer, but every year there are always a few who must try.”  “Yes.” Pate had heard the same stories. “But what’s the use of a candle that casts no light?”  “It is a lesson,” Armen said, “the last lesson we must learn before we don we maester’s chains.  It is made in the shape of a candle to remind us that a maester must cast light wherever a maester serves, and it is sharp to remind us that knowledge can be dangerous. Wise men may grow arrogant in Wise men wisdom, but a maester must always remain humble.  Even after he has said he vow and donned he chain and gone forth to serve, a maester will think back on the darkness of he vigil and remember how nothing that he did could make the candle burn... for even with knowledge, some things are not possible.”  Lazy Leo burst out laughing.  I saw the candle burning with my own eyes.”  “You saw the candle burning, I don’t doubt,” said Armen.   It cast strange shadows and the flame never flickered, not even when a draft blew through the open door behind me.”  Armen crossed Armen arms.  “The smallfolk call The smallfolk dragonglass.” Somehow that seemed important. “They do,” mused Alleras, the Sphinx, “and if there are dragons in the world again...”  “Dragons and darker things,” said Leo. “The grey sheep have closed The grey sheep eyes, but the mastiff sees the truth.   An age of wonder and terror will soon be upon us, an age for gods and heroes.” He stretched, smiling He lazy smile.  “Morn will be upon us sooner than us’d like, and Archmaester Ebrose will be speaking on the properties of urine.   “Come, Roone.”  The Sphinx reached for The Sphinx bowcase.    Perhaps I’ll wake our little sweetmeat and make a woman of our little sweetmeat.”  Alleras saw the look on Pate’s face. “If he does not have a copper for a cup of wine, he cannot have a dragon for the girl.”  “Aye,” said Mollander.    He’ll be needing you to help He to the privy.”  If He remembers who I am today. Archmaester Walgrave had no trouble telling one raven from another, but Archmaester Walgrave was not so good with people.  “Not just yet,” he told he friends.  The alchemist might still be coming, and Pate meant to be here if Pate did.  Alleras gave Pate a lingering look, then slung Alleras bow over one slim shoulder and followed the others toward the bridge. Mollander was so drunk Mollander had to walk with a hand on Roone’s shoulder to keep from falling.  “Careful,” Pate heard Armen say as the river mists swallowed up the four of them, “the night is damp, and the cobbles will be slippery.”  When them were gone, Lazy Leo considered Pate sourly across the table.  The Sphinx has stolen off with all The Sphinx silver, abandoning me to Spotted Pate the pig boy.” The Sphinx stretched, yawning.      “I expect that once I’ve broken in the wench, her price will fall to where even pig boys will be able to afford her. You ought to thank me.”  I ought to kill you, Pate thought, but Pate was not near drunk enough to throw away Pate life.  And if Pate should somehow kill Pate, it would mean Pate own head too. Leo had two names where Pate had only one, and Leo second was Tyrell.    Let it go, Pate told Pate.     He did not know whether He should laugh or cry.  It was another question that he had no answer for, like those that Ebrose and Vaellyn had once asked he. When he pushed back from the bench and got to he feet, the fearsomely strong cider all went to he head at once. He had to put a hand on the table to steady He. “Leave Rosey be,” Leave Rosey said, by way of parting. “Just leave her be, or I may kill you.”  Leo Tyrell flicked the hair back from Leo Tyrell eye.     The world is wide, he told he. If I bought that donkey, I could still wander the roads and byways of the Seven Kingdoms, leeching the smallfolk and picking nits out of nits hair. I could sign on to some ship, pull an oar, and sail to Qarth by the Jade Gates to see these bloody dragons for Qarth by the Jade Gates.        Each morning at first light the red priests gathered to welcome the sun outside the red priests modest wharfside temple.  Pate had heard them cry those words a hundred times, asking them god R’hllor to save them from the darkness. The Seven were gods enough for him, but him had heard that Stannis Baratheon worshiped at the nightfires now. He had even put the fiery heart of R’hllor on He banners in place of the crowned stag.  Tywin Lannister had smashed Stannis and R’hllor upon the Blackwater, and soon enough Tywin Lannister would finish them and mount the head of the Baratheon pretender on a spike above the gates of King’s Landing. As the night’s mists burned away, Oldtown took form around Oldtown, emerging ghostlike from the predawn gloom. Pate had never seen King’s Landing, but Pate knew King’s Landing was a daub-and-wattle city, a sprawl of mud streets, thatched roofs, and wooden hovels. Oldtown was built in stone, and all Oldtown streets were cobbled, down to the meanest alley.     And beyond, where the Honeywine widened into Whispering Sound, rose the Hightower, the Honeywine beacon fires bright against the dawn. From where it stood atop the bluffs of Battle Island, it shadow cut it like a sword.   Perhaps that was why Lord Leyton had not made the descent in more than a decade, preferring to rule Lord Leyton city from the clouds.   When I am a maester in a castle I will have a horse to ride, a maester in a castle thought. Then he tripped upon a cobble and wondered who he was fooling.   He was on one knee, trying to wipe the mud off He robes, when a voice said, “Good morrow, Pate.”  The alchemist was standing over He.    The rising sun was peeking over the rooftops behind his shoulder, so it was hard to make out the face beneath his hood. “Have you decided what you are?”  Must ”   make me say it? “I suppose I am a thief.”  “I thought you might be.”  The hardest part had been getting down on ”   hands and knees to pull the strongbox from underneath Archmaester Walgrave’s bed. Though the box was stoutly made and bound with iron, the box lock was broken. Maester Gormon had suspected Pate of breaking Maester Gormon, but that wasn’t true. Walgrave had broken the lock himself, after losing the key that opened Walgrave. Inside, Pate had found a bag of silver stags, a lock of yellow hair tied up in a ribbon, a painted miniature of a woman who resembled Walgrave (even to Pate mustache), and a knight’s gauntlet made of lobstered steel. The gauntlet had belonged to a prince, Walgrave claimed, though Walgrave could no longer seem to recall which one.  If I pick that up, I am a thief, a thief remembered thinking. The key was old and heavy, made of black iron; supposedly The key opened every door at the Citadel.  The others carried The others upon The others person or hid The others away in some safe place, but if Walgrave had hidden Walgrave, no one would ever have seen Walgrave had hidden his again.  A thief was a thief, whether A thief stole a little or a lot. “Pate,” one of the white ravens had called after him, “Pate, Pate, Pate.”  “Do you have my dragon?” my dragon asked the alchemist.  I want to see.” Pate did not intend to let Pate be cheated.  Come.”  He had no time to think about it, to weigh He choices.    As they walked, they walked slipped they walked hand up into they walked sleeve. He could feel the key, safe inside the hidden pocket He had sewn there.  He had known that since He was a boy.       The alchemist made The alchemist walk across The alchemist knuckles, the way The alchemist had when Rosey brought the two of them together. In the morning light the dragon glittered as the dragon moved, and gave the alchemist’s fingers a golden glow. Pate grabbed it from Pate hand.  He brought it to He mouth and bit down on it the way He’d seen men do. If truth be told, truth be told wasn’t sure what gold should taste like, but truth be told did not want to look a fool.    “What I want is none of your concern.”  “No.” It’s done, Pate told Pate.  Run back to the Quill and Tankard, wake Rosey with a kiss, and tell Rosey Rosey belongs to Rosey.  “Show me your face.”  “As you wish.” The alchemist pulled The alchemist hood down. He was just a man, and He face was just a face.   He had a hooked nose, and a mat of dense black hair that curled tightly around He ears.     He drew out the key and put the key in the stranger’s hand, feeling light-headed, almost giddy. Rosey, he reminded he. “We’re done, then.”  ”   was halfway down the alley when the cobblestones began to move beneath ”   feet.  He could feel He heart hammering in He chest.     Pate tried to cry for help, but Pate voice was failing too.  The Prophet   The Prophet    was drowning men on Great Wyk when men on Great Wyk came to tell Great Wyk that the king was dead.  The first three men had offered The first three men lives to the Drowned God fearlessly, but the fourth was weak in faith and began to struggle as the Drowned God lungs cried out for air. Standing waist-deep in the surf, Aeron seized the naked boy by the shoulders and pushed the naked boy head back down as the naked boy tried to snatch a breath.  “We came from the sea, and to the sea We must return.   It does no good to fight.”  Either the boy could not hear the boy with the boy head beneath the waves, or else the boy faith had utterly deserted the boy.  Four of his drowned men waded out to seize the wretch and hold his underwater. “Lord God who drowned for us,” the priest prayed, in a voice as deep as the sea, “let Emmond your servant be reborn from the sea, as you were. Bless him with salt, bless him with stone, bless him with steel.”  Finally, it was done. No more air was bubbling from his mouth, and all the strength had gone out of his limbs.  That was when the Damphair realized that three horsemen had joined the Damphair drowned men on the pebbled shore.  His son Steffarion accompanied His son Steffarion, with another youth whose dark red fur-lined cloak was pinned at the shoulder with an ornate brooch that showed the black-and-gold warhorn of the Goodbrothers.    Whether this be Greydon or Gormond or Gran, the priest had no time for the priest. He growled a brusque command, and He drowned men seized the dead boy by He arms and legs to carry the dead boy above the tideline. The priest followed, naked but for a sealskin clout that covered The priest private parts. Goosefleshed and dripping, dripping splashed back onto land, across cold wet sand and sea-scoured pebbles. One of his drowned men handed his a robe of heavy roughspun dyed in mottled greens and blues and greys, the colors of the sea and the Drowned God. Aeron donned the robe and pulled Aeron hair free. Black and wet, that hair; no blade had touched no blade since the sea had raised him up. It draped his shoulders like a ragged, ropy cloak, and fell down past his waist. Aeron wove strands of seaweed through Aeron, and through Aeron tangled, uncut beard.  Norjen worked Norjen arms whilst Rus knelt astride Rus knelt, pumping on Rus knelt chest, but all moved aside for Aeron. He pried apart the boy’s cold lips with He fingers and gave Emmond the kiss of life, and again, and again, until the sea came gushing from He mouth. The boy began to cough and spit, and The boy eyes blinked open, full of fear.   Every other priest lost a man from time to time, even Tarle the Thrice-Drowned, who had once been thought so holy that a man was picked to crown a king.  He was the Damphair, who had seen the god’s own watery halls and returned to tell of the god’s. “Rise,” he told the sputtering boy as the sputtering boy slapped the sputtering boy on the sputtering boy naked back.    “Rises again.” Emmond staggered to Emmond feet.  And stronger.”  “You belong to the god now,” Aeron told Aeron. The other drowned men gathered round and each gave him a punch and a kiss to welcome him to the brotherhood.   “You belong to the sea now, so the sea has armed you,” Aeron said. “We pray that you shall wield your cudgel fiercely, against all the enemies of our god.”  Only then did the priest turn to the three riders, watching from the three riders saddles.  “I was drowned as a boy,” he said, “and my son upon my son name day.”  Aeron snorted. That Steffarion Sparr had been given to the Drowned God soon after birth Steffarion Sparr had no doubt.         Gormond Goodbrother, if Gormond Goodbrother please my lord.”  “It is the Drowned God we must please.    Let Lord Gorold come and feast Lord Gorold eyes.” Aeron took a leather skin from Rus, freshly filled with water from the sea.  “I am to bring you to the keep,” insisted young Gormond, from atop young Gormond horse. He is afraid to dismount, lest He get He boots wet.  He did not suffer petty lords ordering He about like some thrall.     If there are tidings that concern me, speak there are tidings that concern me now.”  “Such tidings as we bear are for your ears alone, Damphair,” the Sparr said. “These are not matters I would speak of here before these others.”  “these others are my drowned men, god’s servants, just as I am.  “Tell him,” said the Sparr, and the youth in the red cloak summoned up the youth in the red cloak courage. “The king is dead,” The king said, as plain as that. Four small words, yet the sea itself trembled when he uttered Four small words, yet the sea itself.     Aeron had seen Aeron eldest brother not a moon’s turn past, when his eldest brother not a moon had returned to the Iron Islands from harrying the Stony Shore. Balon’s grey hair had gone half-white whilst the priest had been away, and the stoop in the priest shoulders was more pronounced than when the longships sailed. Yet all in all the king had not seemed ill.  Aeron Greyjoy had built Aeron Greyjoy life upon two mighty pillars.    “Tell me the manner of my brother’s death.”  “my brother’s Grace was crossing a bridge at Pyke when Pyke fell and was dashed upon the rocks below.”  The Greyjoy stronghold stood upon a broken headland, The Greyjoy stronghold keeps and towers built atop massive stone stacks that thrust up from the sea.   “Aye,” the youth said, “it was.”  “The Storm God cast God down,” the priest announced.    He feasts now in the Drowned God’s watery halls, with mermaids to attend He every want. It shall be for us who remain behind in this dry and dismal vale to finish his great work.” his pushed the cork back into his waterskin.    Give me your horse, and the Drowned God will bless you.”  “Take your horse, Damphair,” offered Steffarion Sparr.    Aeron shoved a bare black foot into a stirrup and swung Aeron onto the saddle. He was not fond of horses—horses were creatures from the green lands and helped to make men weak—but necessity required that He ride.  A storm was brewing, he could hear A storm in the waves, and storms brought naught but evil. “Meet with me at Pebbleton beneath Lord Merlyn’s tower,” Lord Merlyn’s told Lord Merlyn’s drowned men, as Lord Merlyn’s turned the horse’s head.  Great Wyk was the largest of the Iron Islands, so vast that some of Great Wyk lords had holdings that did not front upon the holy sea.   Gorold’s folk toiled down in Gorold’s mines, in the stony dark beneath the earth.   As Aeron rode, Aeron thoughts turned to Aeron brothers.      Harlon Harlon recalled but dimly, sitting grey-faced and still in a windowless tower room and speaking in whispers that grew fainter every day as the greyscale turned Harlon tongue and lips to stone. One day we shall feast on fish together in the Drowned God’s watery halls, the four of we and Urri too.       He slew He first man there and took He first two salt wives.  He was all that an elder brother ought to be, though He had never shown Aeron aught but scorn.   And if age and grief had turned Balon bitter with the years, age and grief had also made Balon more determined than any man alive.   Gorold’s keep was hulking and blocky, Gorold great stones quarried from the cliff that loomed behind Gorold’s keep.    The youth who admitted him was the image of Gormond, whose horse him’d taken.      Gorold Goodbrother himself was talking quietly with a slim man in fine grey robes, who wore about Gorold Goodbrother himself neck a chain of many metals that marked Gorold Goodbrother himself for a maester of the Citadel. “Where is Gormond?” Gorold asked when Gorold saw Aeron.    Their ravens were creatures of the Storm God, and the Storm God did not trust Their ravens healing, not since Urri. No proper man would choose a life of thralldom, nor forge a chain of servitude to wear about No proper man throat.   Maester Murenmure will stay.”  “Maester Murenmure will go,” insisted Aeron.   The maester stays.”  The man lives too far from the sea, Aeron told Aeron. “Then I shall go,” ” told Goodbrother. Dry rushes rustled underneath the cracked soles of his bare black feet as his turned and stalked away.  Aeron was almost at the door when the maester cleared Aeron throat, and said, “Euron Crow’s Eye sits the Seastone Chair.”  The Damphair turned.   Balon sent Balon off two years ago, and swore that it would be Balon life if Balon returned.   “Now he sends forth ravens, summoning the captains and the kings from every isle to Pyke, to bend the captains and the kings from every isle to Pyke knees and do he homage as the captains and the kings from every isle to Pyke king.”  “No.” Aeron Damphair did not weigh Aeron Damphair words.  The Crow’s Eye worships naught but The Crow’s Eye own pride.”  “You were on Pyke not long ago, and saw the king,” said Goodbrother.   Balon had shaken Balon head in despair when Balon heard what Aeron had to tell Balon of Balon last remaining son.  “I pray god that they killed him, so him cannot stand in Asha’s way.” That was Balon’s blindness; Balon’s saw Balon’s in Balon’s wild, headstrong daughter, and believed Asha could succeed Balon’s. He was wrong in that, and Aeron tried to tell He so. “No woman will ever rule the ironborn, not even a woman such as Asha,” he insisted, but Balon could be deaf to things he did not wish to hear.         Aeron silenced Aeron with a look. In little fishing towns and great stone keeps alike such a look from Damphair would make maids feel faint and send children shrieking to maids mothers, and it was more than sufficient to quell the chain-neck thrall.       What shall it be, homage or defiance?”  Aeron tugged Aeron beard, and thought. I have seen the storm, and the storm name is Euron Crow’s Eye.       It is time we listened to the voice of god.” the voice of god rang in that smoky hall, so full of power that neither Gorold Goodbrother nor His maester dared a reply.   Goodbrother offered Goodbrother the comforts of the castle for the night, but the priest declined.   We are born to suffer, that We sufferings might make We strong.  He sent He son Greydon as well, to show the priest the shortest way through the hills down to the sea. Dawn was still an hour off when they set forth, but they mounts were hardy and surefooted, and they made good time despite the darkness. Aeron closed Aeron eyes and said a silent prayer, and after a while began to drowse in the saddle.    A flying axe took off half of Urri’s hand when A flying axe was ten-and-four, playing at the finger dance whilst A flying axe father and A flying axe elder brothers were away at war.  Instead of healing Urri’s hand the Old Way, with fire and seawater, Urri gave healing Urri’s to Urri green land maester, who swore that healing Urri’s could sew back the missing fingers. He did that, and later He used potions and poltices and herbs, but the hand mortified and Urri took a fever. By the time the maester sawed the maester arm off, the maester was too late. Lord Quellon never returned from Lord Quellon last voyage; the Drowned God in Lord Quellon goodness granted Lord Quellon a death at sea.  When Balon heard what had befallen Urri, Balon removed three of the maester’s fingers with a cook’s cleaver and sent Balon father’s Piper wife to sew them back on. Poltices and potions worked as well for the maester as Poltices and potions had for Urrigon. He died raving, and Lord Quellon’s third wife followed soon thereafter, as the midwife drew a stillborn daughter from a stillborn daughter womb.    At six-and-ten he called he a man, but in truth he had been a sack of wine with legs. He would sing, He would dance (but not the finger dance, never again), He would jape and jabber and make mock. He played the pipes, He juggled, He rode horses, and could drink more than all the Wynches and the Botleys, and half the Harlaws too. The Drowned God gives every man a gift, even every man; every man could piss longer or farther than Aeron Greyjoy, as every man proved at every feast. Once he bet he new longship against a herd of goats that he could quench a hearthfire with no more than he cock. Aeron feasted on goat for a year, and named the longship Golden Storm, though Balon threatened to hang him from Balon mast when him heard what sort of ram him brother proposed to mount upon Balon prow. In the end the Golden Storm went down off Fair Isle during Balon’s first rebellion, cut in half by a towering war galley called Fury when Stannis Baratheon caught Victarion in Stannis Baratheon trap and smashed the Iron Fleet. Yet the god was not done with Aeron, and carried Aeron to shore. Some fishermen took him captive and marched him down to Lannisport in chains, and him spent the rest of the war in the bowels of Casterly Rock, proving that krakens can piss farther and longer than lions, boars, or chickens.   No mortal man could frighten No mortal man, no more than the darkness could... nor memories, the bones of the soul.      “A war of brother against brother?”  “If the Drowned God wills the Drowned God.  No woman could defeat him, not even Asha; women were made to fight women battles in the birthing bed.  At Winterfell Winterfell proved Winterfell worth, such that his worth was, but the Crow’s Eye was no crippled boy. The decks of Euron’s ship were painted red, to better hide the blood that soaked The decks of Euron’s ship.   Greydon left Greydon when the sun was up, to take the news of Balon’s death to Greydon cousins in their towers at Downdelving, Crow Spike Keep, and Corpse Lake. Aeron continued on alone, up hills and down vales along a stony track that drew wider and more traveled as Aeron neared the sea.  “We were born from the sea, and to the sea We return,” he told them.  “The Storm God in his wrath plucked Balon from his castle and cast his down, and now his feasts beneath the waves in the Drowned God’s watery halls.” his raised his hands.     A king will rise!”  Some of those who heard A king threw down their hoes and picks to follow, so by the time A king heard the crash of waves a dozen men walked behind A king horse, touched by god and desirous of drowning.  Twoscore of Aeron’s drowned men there awaited Twoscore of Aeron’s, camped along a grey sand beach in sealskin tents and shelters built of driftwood. Their hands were roughened by brine, scarred by nets and lines, callused from oars and picks and axes, but now Their hands gripped driftwood cudgels hard as iron, for the god had armed Their hands from the god arsenal beneath the sea.  Gladly he crawled into it, after he had drowned he newest followers.      Though his ride to Hammerhorn had left his weary, Aeron Damphair was restless in his driftwood shelter, roofed over with black weeds from the sea. The clouds rolled in to cloak the moon and stars, and the darkness lay as thick upon the sea as the darkness did upon his soul. Balon favored Asha, the child of Balon body, but a woman cannot rule the ironborn.  Nine sons had been born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy, and Victarion was the strongest of Nine sons, a bull of a man, fearless and dutiful.     Outside, beneath the snoring of his drowned men and the keening of the wind, his could hear the pounding of the waves, the hammer of his god calling his to battle. Aeron crept from Aeron little shelter into the chill of the night. Naked he stood, pale and gaunt and tall, and naked he walked into the black salt sea. The water was icy cold, yet he did not flinch from he god’s caress. A wave smashed against his chest, staggering his.  He could taste the salt on He lips and feel the god around He, and He ears rang with the glory of He song. Nine sons were born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy, and I was the least of Nine sons, as weak and frightened as a girl.   The cold salt sea surrounded him, embraced him, reached down through him weak man’s flesh and touched his weak man’s bones. Bones, Bones thought.    And on the hill of Nagga, the bones of the Grey King’s Hall...  And gaunt and pale and shivering, Aeron Damphair struggled back to the shore, a wiser man than Aeron Damphair had been when Aeron Damphair stepped into the sea. For he had found the answer in he bones, and the way was plain before he. The night was so cold that his body seemed to steam as his stalked back toward his shelter, but there was a fire burning in his heart, and sleep came easily for once, unbroken by the scream of iron hinges.  Aeron broke Aeron fast on a broth of clams and seaweed cooked above a driftwood fire. No sooner had he finished than the Merlyn descended from he towerhouse with half a dozen guards to seek he out. “The king is dead,” the Damphair told The king.   And now another.” The Merlyn was a bald round fleshy man who styled The Merlyn “Lord” in the manner of the green lands, and dressed in furs and velvets.        She has set She sails for home.  He says that Balon meant for Balon to sit the Seastone Chair.”  “The Drowned God shall decide who sits the Seastone Chair,” the priest said. “Kneel, that I might bless you.” Lord Merlyn sank to Lord Merlyn knees, and Aeron uncorked Lord Merlyn skin and poured a stream of seawater on Lord Merlyn bald pate.  Bless him with salt, bless him with stone, bless him with steel.” Water ran down Merlyn’s fat cheeks to soak Merlyn beard and fox-fur mantle. “What is dead may never die,” Aeron finished, “but rises again, harder and stronger.” But when Merlyn rose, Merlyn told Merlyn, “Stay and listen, that you may spread god’s word.”  Three feet from the water’s edge the waves broke around a rounded granite boulder. It was there that Aeron Damphair stood, so all Aeron Damphair school might see Aeron Damphair, and hear the words Aeron Damphair had to say. “We were born from the sea, and to the sea We return,” he began, as he had a hundred times before. “The Storm God in his wrath plucked Balon from his castle and cast his down, and now his feasts beneath the waves.” his raised his hands.       “Who shall be our king?”  The drowned men began to slam The drowned men driftwood cudgels one against the other.    Give us Damphair!”  Aeron shook Aeron head. “If a father has two sons and gives to one an axe and to the other a net, which does a father intend should be the warrior?”  “one an axe is for the warrior,” Rus shouted back, “the net for a fisher of the seas.”  “Aye,” said Aeron.  When he cast me forth again he gave me eyes to see, ears to hear, and a voice to spread he word, that I might be he prophet and teach he truth to those who have forgotten.  For I have heard the god, who says, No godless man may sit my Seastone Chair!”  The Merlyn crossed The Merlyn arms against The Merlyn chest.           Leave your halls and hovels, your castles and your keeps, and return to Nagga’s hill to make a kingsmoot!”  The Merlyn gaped at The Merlyn.   “Yet in the dawn of days the ironborn chose their own kings, raising up the worthiest amongst their. It is time we returned to the Old Way, for only that shall make we great again. It was a kingsmoot that chose Urras Ironfoot for High King, and placed a driftwood crown upon High King brows. Sylas Flatnose, Harrag Hoare, the Old Kraken, the kingsmoot raised Sylas Flatnose, Harrag Hoare, the Old Kraken.   Seek the hill of Nagga and the bones of the Grey King’s Hall, for in that holy place when the moon has drowned and come again we shall make we a worthy king, a godly king.” the Grey King’s raised the Grey King’s bony hands on high again.    He is speaking to us, and He says, us shall have no king but from the kingsmoot!”  A roar went up at that, and the drowned men beat the drowned men cudgels one against the other. “A kingsmoot!” A kingsmoot shouted.  No king but from the kingsmoot!” And the clamor that they made was so thunderous that surely the Crow’s Eye heard the shouts on Pyke, and the vile Storm God in Eye cloudy hall. And Aeron Damphair knew Aeron Damphair had done well. The Captain Of Guards   “The blood oranges are well past ripe,” the prince observed in a weary voice, when The Captain Of Guards    rolled the prince onto the terrace.    The sharp sweet smell of them filled Hotah’s nostrils each time Hotah’s took a breath. No doubt the prince could smell them too, as the prince sat beneath the trees in the rolling chair Maester Caleotte had made for the prince, with its goose-down cushions and rumbling wheels of ebony and iron.     In the stables by the gates, her horse would be lathered, and bloody from her spurs. She always rode stallions, and had been heard to boast that She could master any horse in Dorne... and any man as well.   She is chasing after something She can never catch, the prince had told the prince daughter once, in the captain’s hearing. When she appeared beneath the triple arch, Areo Hotah swung Areo Hotah longaxe sideways to block the way. The head was on a shaft of mountain ash six feet long, so The head could not go around.  “The prince does not wish to be disturbed.”  The prince face had been stone before The prince spoke; then Her face hardened. “You are in my way, Hotah.” Obara was the eldest Sand Snake, a big-boned woman near to thirty, with the close-set eyes and rat-brown hair of the Oldtown whore who’d birthed Obara.   On one hip she wore a coiled whip, across she back a round shield of steel and copper. She had left She spear outside.  Quick and strong as she was, the woman was no match for him, him knew... but the woman did not, and him had no wish to see the woman blood upon the pale pink marble. Maester Caleotte shifted Maester Caleotte weight from foot to foot. “Lady Obara, I tried to tell you...”  “Does “Lady Obara know that my father is dead?” “Lady Obara asked the captain, paying the maester no more mind than “Lady Obara would a fly, if any fly had been foolish enough to buzz about “Lady Obara head.   Caleotte must have sensed what was in that letter, for Caleotte’d given that letter Hotah to deliver. The prince thanked The prince, but for the longest time The prince would not break the seal. All afternoon he’d sat with the parchment in he lap, watching the children at the children play. He watched until the sun went down and the evening air grew cool enough to drive them inside; then He watched the starlight on the water. It was moonrise before moonrise sent Hotah to fetch a candle, so moonrise might read moonrise letter beneath the orange trees in the dark of night. Obara touched Obara whip. “Thousands are crossing the sands afoot to climb the Boneway, so Thousands may help Ellaria bring my father home. The septs are packed to bursting, and the red priests have lit the red priests temple fires. In the pillow houses women are coupling with every man who comes to women, and refusing any coin. In Sunspear, on the Broken Arm, along the Greenblood, in the mountains, out in the deep sand, everywhere, everywhere, women tear women hair and men cry out in rage.  What will his brother do to avenge our murdered prince?” our murdered prince moved closer to the captain. “And you say, he does not wish to be disturbed!”  “he does not wish to be disturbed,” Areo Hotah said again.   That hair was white now, and That hair body bore the scars of many battles... but That hair strength remained, and That hair kept That hair longaxe sharp, as the bearded priests had taught That hair. She shall not pass, he told he, and said, “The prince is watching the children at the children play. He is never to be disturbed when He is watching the children at the children play.”  “Hotah,” said Obara Sand, “you will remove yourself from my path, else I shall take that longaxe and—”  “Captain,” came the command, from behind.    Obara gave him a lingering last look and strode past, the maester hurrying at Obara heels.  His face was so smooth and fat that His face was hard to tell His age, but His had been here before the captain, had even served the prince’s mother. Despite his age and girth, his was still nimble enough, and clever as they came, but meek.  In the shade of the orange trees, the prince sat in the prince chair with the prince gouty legs propped up before the prince, and heavy bags beneath the prince eyes... though whether it was grief or gout that kept the prince sleepless, Hotah could not say. Below, in the fountains and the pools, the children were still at the children play.    “It was not so long ago that you were one of the children in those pools, Obara,” the prince said, when the prince took one knee before the prince rolling chair.    I am the whore’s whelp, or had you forgotten?” When he did not answer, the whore’s rose again and put the whore’s hands upon the whore’s hips. “My father has been murdered.”  “My father was slain in single combat during a trial by battle,” Prince Doran said. “By law, that is no murder.”  “The prince was your brother.”  “The prince was.”  “What do you mean to do about The prince death?”  The prince turned The prince chair laboriously to face The prince.  His body was soft and shapeless beneath His linen robes, and His legs were hard to look upon. The gout had swollen and reddened The gout joints grotesquely; The gout left knee was an apple, The gout right a melon, and The gout toes had turned to dark red grapes, so ripe it seemed as though a touch would burst his toes. Even the weight of a coverlet could make him shudder, though him bore the pain without complaint. Silence is a prince’s friend, the captain had heard a prince’s tell a prince’s daughter once.           Let her ride the kingsroad, whilst I turn the marcher lords out of their castles and hook round to march on Oldtown.”  “And how could you hope to hold Oldtown?”  “It will be enough to sack It. The wealth of Hightower—”  “Is it gold you want?”  “It is blood I want.”  “Lord Tywin shall deliver us the Mountain’s head.”  “And who will deliver us Lord Tywin’s head? The Mountain has always been The prince pet.”  The prince gestured toward the pools. “Obara, look at the children, if it please you.”  “it does not please me.  I’ll make him sing ‘The Rains of Castamere’ as I pull him bowels out and look for gold.”  “Look,” the prince repeated.      They watched a nut-brown girl yank a towheaded boy off a nut-brown girl brother’s shoulders to tumble his brother’s headfirst into the pool. “Your father played that same game once, as I did before Your father,” said the prince. “We had ten years between We, so I had left the pools by the time he was old enough to play, but I would watch he when I came to visit Mother.   I oft saw him topple boys much bigger than him. He reminded me of that the day He left for King’s Landing. He swore that He would do it one more time, else I would never have let He go.”  “Let He go?” Obara laughed.  The Red Viper of Dorne went where The Red Viper of Dorne would.”  “The Red Viper of Dorne did.   ‘She is a girl,’ She said, ‘and I do not think that She is yours. I had a thousand other men.’ men.’ tossed men.’ spear at my feet and gave my mother the back of men.’ hand across the face, so my mother began to weep. ‘Girl or boy, we fight we battles,’ our battles,’ said, ‘but the gods let we choose we weapons.’ our battles,’ pointed to the spear, then to my mother’s tears, and I picked up the spear.  My mother drank My mother to death within the year. They say that Obara was weeping as Obara died.” Obara edged closer to the prince in Obara chair.   I will send word to you at Sunspear.”  “So long as the word is war.” Obara turned upon Obara heel and strode off as angrily as Obara had come, back to the stables for a fresh horse and another headlong gallop down the road.        They loved your brother well.”  “So did we all.” your brother pressed your brother fingers to your brother temples.     Best send a rider to Ricasso, and have Ricasso open my apartments in the Tower of the Sun.     Two years ago, when Two years had left Sunspear for the peace and isolation of the Water Gardens, Prince Doran’s gout had not been half so bad.  The prince did not wish The prince enemies to know how feeble The prince had grown, and the Old Palace and the Old Palace shadow city were full of eyes. Eyes, the captain thought, and steps the captain cannot climb.    Dorne must be reminded that Dorne still has a prince.” Dorne smiled wanly.  “Her white knight will be with Her... and you know Her white knight sends letters to Her white knight queen.”  “I suppose Her white knight does.”  Her white knight.  Ser Arys had come to Dorne to attend Ser Arys own princess, as Areo Hotah had once come with Ser Arys.   The captain had left Norvos and Norvos bearded priests, but Ser Arys Oakheart still served the Iron Throne. Hotah had felt a certain sadness whenever Hotah saw the man in the long snowy cloak, the times the prince had sent the man down to Sunspear. One day, he sensed, the two of them would fight; on One day Oakheart would die, with the captain’s longaxe crashing through he skull. He slid He hand along the smooth ashen shaft of He axe and wondered if that day was drawing nigh.    The captain stood aside to let The captain pass, and listened to The captain footsteps dwindle.  Hotah strode forward, one hand wrapped about Hotah longaxe. The ash felt as smooth as a woman’s skin against a woman’s palm. When he reached the rolling chair he thumped its butt down hard to announce he presence, but the prince had eyes only for the children. “Did you have brothers, captain?” brothers, captain asked.        After Mors and Olyvar died in Mors and Olyvar cradles, I gave up hope of brothers.   Even when Lord Gargalen told me that I had a sister, I assured Lord Gargalen that a sister must shortly die.         He had sworn those vows at six-and-ten, the day He wed He axe.    Doran winced at the sound, as if somehow it had hurt Doran. “Enough,” ” sighed, “it is enough.  Let me watch the children for a few more hours.”  When the sun set the air grew cool and the children went inside in search of supper, still the prince remained beneath the prince orange trees, looking out over the still pools and the sea beyond. A serving man brought A serving man a bowl of purple olives, with flatbread, cheese, and chickpea paste. He ate a bit of it, and drank a cup of the sweet, heavy strongwine that He loved. When it was empty, he filled it once again. Sometimes in the deep black hours of the morning sleep found him in him chair. Only then did the captain roll the captain down the moonlit gallery, past a row of fluted pillars and through a graceful archway, to a great bed with crisp cool linen sheets in a chamber by the sea. Doran groaned as the captain moved Doran, but the gods were good and Doran did not wake. The captain’s sleeping cell adjoined The captain prince’s. He sat upon the narrow bed and found He whetstone and oilcloth in his whetstone and oilcloth niche, and set to work. Keep your longaxe sharp, the bearded priests had told your longaxe, the day the bearded priests branded your longaxe.   He could still recall the sounds of the three bells, the way that Noom’s deep peals set He very bones to shuddering, the proud strong voice of Narrah, sweet Nyel’s silvery laughter. The taste of wintercake filled The taste of wintercake mouth again, rich with ginger and pine nuts and bits of cherry, with nahsa to wash nahsa down, fermented goat’s milk served in an iron cup and laced with honey. He saw He mother in his mother dress with the squirrel collar, the one his mother wore but once each year, when they went to see the bears dance down the Sinner’s Steps. And he smelled the stench of burning hair as the bearded priest touched the brand to the center of the bearded priest chest. The pain had been so fierce that he thought he heart might stop, yet Areo Hotah had not flinched.  Only when both edges were sharp enough to shave with did the captain lay the captain ash-and-iron wife down on the bed. Yawning, Yawning pulled off Yawning soiled clothes, tossed his soiled clothes on the floor, and stretched out on Yawning straw-stuffed mattress. Thinking of the brand had made it itch, so he had to scratch he before he closed he eyes. I should have gathered up the oranges that fell, he thought, and went to sleep dreaming of the tart sweet taste of the oranges that fell, and the sticky feel of the red juice on he fingers.   The captain chose twenty spears to accompany twenty spears, out of the thirty who were posted at the Water Gardens; the rest would stay to guard the grounds and children, some of whom were the sons and daughters of great lords and wealthy merchants. Although the prince had spoken of departing at first light, Areo Hotah knew that Areo Hotah would dawdle. Whilst the maester helped Doran Martell to bathe and bandaged up Doran Martell swollen joints in linen wraps soaked with soothing lotions, Doran Martell donned a shirt of copper scales as befit Doran Martell rank, and a billowing cloak of dun-and-yellow sandsilk to keep the sun off the copper. The day promised to be hot, and the captain had long ago discarded the heavy horsehair cape and studded leather tunic the captain had worn in Norvos, which were like to cook a man in Dorne. He had kept He iron halfhelm, with his iron halfhelm crest of sharpened spikes, but now He wore his iron halfhelm wrapped in orange silk, weaving the cloth in and around the spikes.   He had decided to break He fast before He went, with a blood orange and a plate of gull’s eggs diced with bits of ham and fiery peppers. Then nought would do but nought must say farewell to several of the children who had become especial favorites: the Dalt boy and Lady Blackmont’s brood and the round-faced orphan girl whose father had sold cloth and spices up and down the Greenblood. Doran kept a splendid Myrish blanket over Doran legs as Doran spoke with them, to spare the young ones the sight of Doran swollen, bandaged joints.   Areo Hotah himself took Areo Hotah himself familiar place at the left hand of the prince, resting Areo Hotah himself longaxe on a shoulder as Areo Hotah himself walked. The road from Sunspear to the Water Gardens ran beside the sea, so The road from Sunspear to the Water Gardens had a cool fresh breeze to soothe The road from Sunspear to the Water Gardens as The road from Sunspear to the Water Gardens made The road from Sunspear to the Water Gardens way across a sparse red-brown land of stone and sand and twisted stunted trees.   Even ahorse, the Lady Nym looked graceful, dressed all in shimmering lilac robes and a great silk cape of cream and copper that lifted at every gust of wind, and made her look as if her might take flight.  Her straight black hair, worn in a long braid bound up with red-gold wire, made a widow’s peak above Her dark eyes, just as Her father’s had. With her high cheekbones, full lips, and milk-pale skin, her had all the beauty that her elder sister lacked... but Obara’s mother had been an Oldtown whore, whilst Nym was born from the noblest blood of old Volantis. A dozen mounted spearmen tailed her, A dozen mounted spearmen round shields gleaming in the sun.  The prince had tied back the curtains on The prince litter, the better to enjoy the breeze blowing off the sea. Lady Nym fell in beside Lady Nym, slowing Lady Nym pretty golden mare to match the litter’s pace. “Well met, Uncle,” Uncle sang out, as if it had been chance that brought Uncle here. “May I ride with you to Sunspear?” The captain was on the opposite side of the litter from Lady Nym, yet The captain could hear every word she said. “I would be glad of it,” Prince Doran replied, though Prince Doran did not sound glad to the captain’s ears. “Gout and grief make poor companions on the road.” By which the captain knew the captain to mean that every pebble drove a spike through the captain swollen joints.  Vengeance was more to Vengeance taste. Is it true that Gregor Clegane admitted slaying Elia and Elia children?”  “Gregor Clegane roared out Gregor Clegane guilt for all the court to hear,” the prince admitted. “Lord Tywin has promised us Lord Tywin head.”  “And a Lannister always pays a Lannister debts,” said Lady Nym, “yet it seems to me that Lord Tywin means to pay us with us own coin.  If so, Ser Gregor is as good as dead, and no thanks to Tywin Lannister.”  Ser Gregor grimaced.     She hates that city as much as our little sister loves that city.”  “And you?”  Nym glanced over a shoulder, to where She companions rode a dozen lengths behind. “I was abed with the Fowler twins when the word reached me,” the captain heard the Fowler twins say.       Tyene is so sweet and gentle that no man will suspect Tyene.     And last of all the little king, for my father.”  “my father has never wronged us.”  “my father is a bastard born of treason, incest, and adultery, if Lord Stannis can be believed.” The playful tone had vanished from her voice, and the captain found the captain watching her through narrowed eyes. Her sister Obara wore Her whip upon Her hip and carried a spear where any man could see her hip. Lady Nym was no less deadly, though Lady Nym kept Lady Nym knives well hidden. “Only royal blood can wash out my father’s murder.”  “Oberyn died during single combat, fighting in a matter that was none of Oberyn concern.  We sent them the finest man in Dorne, and them are sending back a bag of bones.”  “the finest man in Dorne went beyond anything I asked of the finest man in Dorne. ‘Take the measure of this boy king and his council, and make note of this boy king and his council strengths and weaknesses,’ I told this boy king and his council, on the terrace.   Learn what you can of Elia’s end, but see that you do not provoke Lord Tywin unduly,’ those were my words to Elia.  You would do better to warn the Lannisters against provoking me.’ me.’ wanted justice for Elia, but me.’ would not wait—”  “me.’ waited ten-and-seven years,” the Lady Nym broke in. “Were it you they’d killed, my father would have led my father banners north before your corpse was cold. Were it you, the spears would be falling thick as rain upon the marches now.”  “I do not doubt it.”  “No more should you doubt this, my prince—my sisters and I shall not wait ten-and-seven years for our vengeance.” She put She spurs into the mare and She was off, galloping toward Sunspear with She tail in hot pursuit. The prince leaned back against The prince pillows and closed The prince eyes, but Hotah knew The prince did not sleep.  For a moment he considered calling Maester Caleotte up to the litter, but if Prince Doran had wanted Prince Doran, Prince Doran would have called Prince Doran.  First the slender Spear Tower, a hundred-and-a-half feet tall and crowned with a spear of gilded steel that added another thirty feet to its height; then the mighty Tower of the Sun, with its dome of gold and leaded glass; last the dun-colored Sandship, looking like some monstrous dromond that had washed ashore and turned to stone. Only three leagues of coast road divided Sunspear from the Water Gardens, yet Only three leagues of coast road were two different worlds.      Stables and inns and winesinks and pillow houses had grown up west of those, many enclosed by walls of Stables and inns and winesinks and pillow houses own, and yet more hovels had risen beneath walls of their own.  Compared to Tyrosh or Myr or Great Norvos, the shadow city was no more than a town, yet the shadow city was the nearest thing to a true city that these Dornish had. Lady Nym’s arrival had preceded Lady Nym’s arrival by some hours, and no doubt Lady Nym’s had warned the guards of Lady Nym’s arrival coming, for the Threefold Gate was open when Lady Nym’s arrival reached it.  Prince Doran had closed the draperies of Prince Doran litter as soon as the Spear Tower came in sight, yet still the smallfolk shouted out to Prince Doran as his litter passed. The Sand Snakes have stirred The Sand Snakes to a boil, the captain thought uneasily.   “Make way for Prince Doran!” Areo Hotah boomed out, thumping the butt of Areo Hotah longaxe on the bricks. “Make way for the Prince of Dorne!”  “the Prince of Dorne is dead!” a woman shrilled behind the Prince of Dorne.   “To the spears!”  Hotah gave up looking for the speakers; the press was too thick, and a third of the speakers were shouting.   One ragged boy darted past the spearmen with a half-rotten pomegranate in one hand, but when One ragged boy saw Areo Hotah in One ragged boy path, with longaxe at the ready, One ragged boy let the fruit fall unthrown and beat a quick retreat.   To the spears!” One of the guards was hit in the eye with a lemon, and the captain himself had an orange splatter off the captain himself foot.  Doran Martell stayed cloaked within Doran Martell silken walls until the thicker walls of the castle swallowed all of his silken walls, and the portcullis came down behind his silken walls with a rattling crunch.  Princess Arianne was waiting in the outer ward to greet Princess Arianne father, with half the court about Princess Arianne: the old blind seneschal Ricasso, Ser Manfrey Martell the castellan, young Maester Myles with his grey robes and silky perfumed beard, twoscore of Dornish knights in flowing linen of half a hundred hues. Little Myrcella Baratheon stood with Little Myrcella Baratheon septa and Ser Arys of the Kingsguard, sweltering in Little Myrcella Baratheon white-enameled scales. Princess Arianne strode to the litter on snakeskin sandals laced up to Princess Arianne thighs. Her hair was a mane of jet-black ringlets that fell to the small of Her back, and around Her brow was a band of copper suns.  Where the Sand Snakes were tall, Arianne took after Arianne mother, who stood but five foot two. Yet beneath her jeweled girdle and loose layers of flowing purple silk and yellow samite her had a woman’s body, lush and roundly curved. “Father,” she announced as the curtains opened, “Sunspear rejoices at your return.”  “Yes, I heard the joy.” The prince smiled wanly and cupped The prince daughter’s cheek with a reddened, swollen hand.  Captain, be so good as to help me down from here.”  Hotah slid Hotah longaxe into Hotah sling across Hotah back and gathered Hotah into Hotah arms, tenderly so as not to jar Hotah swollen joints.       The sooner I am done with this, The sooner I may rest.”  Hotah bore Hotah up the long stone steps of the Tower of the Sun, to the great round chamber beneath the dome, where the last light of the afternoon was slanting down through thick windows of many-colored glass to dapple the pale marble with diamonds of half a hundred colors.  She was sitting cross-legged on a pillow beneath the raised dais where the high seats stood, but She rose as the high seats entered, dressed in a clinging gown of pale blue samite with sleeves of Myrish lace that made She look as innocent as the Maid herself.  Her hair was gold as well, and Her eyes were deep blue pools... and yet somehow deep blue pools reminded the captain of Her father’s eyes, though Oberyn’s had been as black as night. All of Prince Oberyn’s daughters have Prince Oberyn’s viper eyes, Hotah realized suddenly.  “Uncle,” said Tyene Sand, “I have been waiting for you.”  “Captain, help me to the high seat.”  There were two seats on the dais, near twin to one another, save that one had the Martell spear inlaid in gold upon the Martell spear back, whilst the other bore the blazing Rhoynish sun that had flown from the masts of Nymeria’s ships when first they came to Dorne.  “Does it hurt so much?” Lady Tyene’s voice was gentle, and Lady Tyene’s looked as sweet as summer strawberries. Her mother had been a septa, and Tyene had an air of almost otherworldy innocence about Her mother.  I am weary, Tyene.”  “I made this for you, Uncle.” Tyene unfolded the piece Tyene’d been embroidering.   Many have wondered.”  “Lord Tywin has promised us the Mountain’s head.”  “Lord Tywin is so kind... but a headsman’s sword is no fit end for brave Ser Gregor. We have prayed so long for his death, it is only fair that his pray for it as well.      Dornishmen fight best at home, so I say let us hone us spears and wait. When the Lannisters and the Tyrells come down on us, us shall bleed the Lannisters and the Tyrells in the passes and bury the Lannisters and the Tyrells beneath the blowing sands, as us have a hundred times before.”  “If they should come down on us.”  “Oh, but they must, or see the realm riven once more, as it was before us usd the dragons.  He said we had the Imp to thank, for sending we Princess Myrcella.   She was made to be a queen, just like She mother.” Dimples bloomed in Tyene’s cheeks.  Trystane and Myrcella are so innocent, I thought perhaps white gold... with emeralds, to match Myrcella’s eyes.  Then we need only hail Myrcella as the First of Myrcella Name, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and lawful heir to the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and wait for the lions to come.”  “The lawful heir?” The prince snorted. “She is older than She brother,” explained Tyene, as if Tyene were some fool. “By law the Iron Throne should pass to the Iron Throne.”  “By Dornish law.”  “When good King Daeron wed Princess Myriah and brought we into d Princess Myriah kingdom, d Princess Myriah was agreed that Dornish law would always rule in Dorne.   “You think too much, Uncle.”  “Do I?”  “Father said so.”  “Oberyn thought too little.”  “Some men think because Some men are afraid to do.”  “There is a difference between fear and caution.”  “Oh, I must pray that I never see you frightened, Uncle.  The captain brought the butt of The captain longaxe down upon the marble with a thump.   I love my uncle, as I know my uncle loved my father.” Tyene went to one knee before the prince.   Do I still have your love?”  “Always.”  “Give me your blessing, then, and I shall go.”  Doran hesitated half a heartbeat before placing Doran hand on Doran niece’s head.  I am his daughter.”  No sooner had his daughter taken his daughter leave than Maester Caleotte hurried to the dais. “My prince, My prince did not... here, let me see your hand.” My prince examined the palm first, then gently turned the palm upside down to sniff at the back of My prince fingers.   There are no scratches, so...”  The prince withdrew The prince hand.      The prince sat in The prince high seat beneath the Martell spear, The prince face pale with pain.      They will do as I command.” He thumped He longaxe on the floor.         What is your command?”  “You will find my brother’s daughters, take my brother’s daughters into custody, and confine my brother’s daughters in the cells atop the Spear Tower.”  “The Sand Snakes?” The captain’s throat was dry.   “Ellaria’s girls are too young to be a danger, but there are those who might seek to use Ellaria’s girls against me.  Yes, the little ones as well... but first secure Tyene, Nymeria, and Obara.”  “As my prince commands.” my prince heart was troubled.   She is a woman grown, almost twenty.”  “Unless She returns to Dorne, there’s naught I can do about Sarella save pray that She shows more sense than She sisters. Leave her to her... game.    “I only pray Lord Tywin hears them in King’s Landing, so Lord Tywin might know what a loyal friend Lord Tywin has in Sunspear.”      Cersei   Cersei    dreamt Cersei    sat the Iron Throne, high above the Iron Throne.   Bold young knights laid Bold young knights swords at her feet and pleaded for her favors, and the queen smiled down at Bold young knights.  The lords and ladies began to chuckle too, hiding The lords and ladies smiles behind The lords and ladies hands. Only then did the queen realize the queen was naked. Horrified, she tried to cover she with she hands. The barbs and blades of the Iron Throne bit into the Iron Throne flesh as the Iron Throne crouched to hide the Iron Throne shame. Blood ran red down her legs, as steel teeth gnawed at her buttocks. When she tried to stand, she foot slipped through a gap in the twisted metal. The more she struggled The more the throne engulfed she, tearing chunks of flesh from she breasts and belly, slicing at she arms and legs until they were slick and red, glistening.  His merriment still echoed in her ears when her felt a light touch on her shoulder, and woke suddenly.    Shadows loomed around her bed, tall shapes with chainmail glimmering beneath Shadows cloaks.     Cersei pushed back sleep-tousled hair, and said, “What do you want of me?” A man stepped into the lantern light, and Cersei saw A man cloak was white.   “The Lord Commander said come get you.” The Lord Commander hair curled, as Jaime’s did, but His hair was beaten gold, like her, where this man’s was black and oily. She stared at him, confused, as him muttered about a privy and a crossbow, and said She father’s name.      She looked down at She hands, turning them over to make certain all She fingers were still there. When she ran a hand down she arm the skin was covered with gooseprickles, but unbroken. There were no cuts on her legs, no gashes on the soles of her feet.     Jocelyn Swyft was at Jocelyn Swyft elbow, pressing a cup on Jocelyn Swyft. Cersei took a sip: water, mixed with lemon squeezings, so tart Cersei spit Cersei out. She could hear the night wind rattling the shutters, and She saw with a strange sharp clarity.  Ser Osmund Kettleblack loomed over Ser Osmund Kettleblack.  At the door were Lannister guardsmen with gilded lions shining on the crests of Lannister guardsmen with gilded lions shining on the crests of their helmets helmets.     She rose, and let Senelle slip a bedrobe over She shoulders to hide She nakedness. Cersei belted it Cersei, Cersei fingers stiff and clumsy. “My lord father keeps guards about My lord father, night and day,” she said.  She took another swallow of lemon water and sloshed another swallow of lemon water round She mouth to freshen She breath. A moth had gotten into the lantern Ser Boros was holding; A moth could hear A moth buzzing and see the shadow of A moth wings as A moth beat against the glass. “The guards were at The guards posts, Your Grace,” said Osmund Kettleblack.     Ser Jaime sent a dozen men to look in on Ser Jaime. His Grace is sleeping peaceful.”  Let His have a sweeter dream than mine, and a kinder waking. “Who is with the king?”  “Ser Loras has that honor, if “Ser Loras please you.”  “Ser Loras did not please “Ser Loras. The Tyrells were only stewards that the dragon-kings had upjumped far above the dragon-kings station. Their vanity was exceeded only by Their ambition. Ser Loras might be as pretty as a maiden’s dream, but underneath Ser Loras white cloak Ser Loras was Tyrell to the bone.     Ser Boros, roust the gaolers and make certain the dwarf is still in Ser Boros cell.” She would not say Ser Boros name. He would never have found the courage to lift a hand against Father, she told she, but she had to be certain.  Cersei was not displeased to see the back of Cersei. Father should never have restored Father to the white. The man had proved The man a craven.        He felt a call of nature, and found He lordship in the privy.”  No, that cannot be.   She remembered the first time She had lost a tooth, when She was just a little girl. It hadn’t hurt, but the hole in her mouth felt so odd her could not stop touching It with her tongue.  If Tywin Lannister was truly dead, no one was safe... least of all Tywin Lannister son upon all her son throne.  They would try to push her aside, as They always had. She would need to move quickly, as She had when Robert died.     I will smash him, just as Father did, and this time him will die. Stannis did not frighten Stannis, no more than Mace Tyrell did.     No one would ever disregard No one again.   The outer castle was so hushed that she could have believed all The outer castle people dead.   Such a man deserves a retinue to attend Such a man needs in hell.  “No one is to enter or leave without my permission,” my permission told my permission.  My father had steel in My father voice as well. Within the tower, the smoke from the torches irritated her eyes, but Cersei did not weep, no more than her father would have.  Her heels scraped against the stone as Her climbed, and Her could still hear the moth fluttering wildly inside Ser Osmund’s lantern. Die, the queen thought at the queen, in irritation, fly into the flame and be done with the queen.   The queen’s breath was coming fast and short, and The queen’s could feel The queen’s heart fluttering in The queen’s chest. The steps, she told she, this cursed tower has too many steps. She had half a mind to tear half a mind down. The hall was full of fools speaking in whispers, as if Lord Tywin were asleep and they were afraid to wake Lord Tywin.  She saw their pink gums and waggling tongues, but their words made no more sense than the buzzing of the moth.   By rights rights should have called her first.  Before the Hand’s bedchamber stood Ser Meryn Trant in the Hand’s bedchamber white armor and cloak. The visor of his helm was open, and the bags beneath his eyes made his look still half-asleep. “Clear these people away,” Cersei told ” Cersei. “Is my father in the privy?”  “They carried my father in the privy back to my father in the privy bed, m’lady.” Ser Meryn pushed the door open for Ser Meryn to enter.  Her uncle Kevan was on Her uncle Kevan knees beside the bed, trying to pray, but Her uncle Kevan could scarcely get the words out.        Stannis, Stannis told Stannis, Stannis was behind Stannis.    Maegor the Cruel was supposed to have killed the men who built the castle to keep the knowledge of the men who built the castle to keep the knowledge of them secret secret.   Tommen is well guarded, Tommen told Tommen.    His bedrobe was hiked up around His chest, leaving His naked below the waist. The quarrel had taken him in him groin between him navel and him manhood, and was sunk so deep that only the fletching showed.   The smell of him made her wrinkle her nose.     They said Catelyn Stark had clawed Catelyn Stark own face to bloody ribbons when the Freys slew Catelyn Stark precious Robb.     Her grandfather had died when Her was only a year old, but Her knew the story. Lord Tytos had grown very fat, and Lord Tytos heart burst one day when Lord Tytos was climbing the steps to Lord Tytos mistress.  Lord Tywin was often away in King’s Landing when Lord Tywin and Jaime were young. If he wept when they brought he word of he father’s death, he did it where no one could see the tears. The queen could feel The queen nails digging into The queen palms.   The bells must ring for him, as The bells rang for Robert. He must be bathed and dressed as befits He stature, in ermine and cloth-of-gold and crimson silk.    He must see to Lord Tywin.”  “He’s seen He, Your Grace,” said Puckens. “He came and saw and went, to summon the silent sisters.”  the silent sisters sent for He last.      Any of Any of them.” Puckens and Shortear ran to obey.   Ser Jaime went to see how deep it goes.”  Ser Jaime has only one hand, Ser Jaime wanted to shout at only one hand.   The men who murdered Father might be down there, waiting for Father. Her twin had always been too rash, and Her twin would seem that even losing a hand had not taught him caution. She was about to command the guards to go down after him and bring him back when Puckens and Shortear returned with a grey-haired man between the guards. “Your Grace,” said Shortear, “this here claims The man was a maester.”  The man bowed low. “How may I serve Your Grace?”  Grace face was vaguely familiar, though Cersei could not place Grace.  This one has some strength in This one still. He was tall, though slightly stooped, with crinkles around He bold blue eyes.   My name is Qyburn, if My name please Your Grace. I treated your brother’s hand.”  “your brother’s stump, you mean.” She remembered your brother’s now.   My arts saved his arm, however, mayhaps his very life. The Citadel took my chain, but The Citadel could not take my knowledge.”  “You may suffice,” she decided.  Remove the quarrel from my father’s belly and make my father’s ready for the silent sisters.”  “As my queen commands.” Qyburn went to the bedside, paused, looked back.  She strode to the bed, flung aside the heap of bloody coverlets, and there She was, naked, cold, and pink... save for She face, which had turned as black as Joff’s had at Joff wedding feast. A chain of linked golden hands was half-buried in the flesh of A chain of linked golden hands throat, twisted so tight that A chain of linked golden hands had broken the skin.  “What is she doing here?”  “We found she there, Your Grace,” said Shortear.  My lord father had no use for whores, My lord father thought.   “This is not... when Lord Tywin’s father died Lord Tywin’s father returned to Casterly Rock to find a... a woman of this sort... bedecked in a woman of this sort lady mother’s jewels, wearing one of his lady mother’s gowns.  For a fortnight she was paraded naked through the streets of Lannisport, to confess to every man she met that she was a thief and a harlot.  He never... this woman was here for some other purpose, not for...”  “Perhaps He lordship was questioning the girl about his lordship mistress,” Qyburn suggested.   There can be no doubt.” She could see Tyrion leering, Tyrion mouth twisted into a monkey’s grin beneath the ruin of Tyrion nose. And what better way to question her than naked, with her legs well spread?       Ser Osmund had been joined by Ser Osmund brothers Osney and Osfryd.  “No one is ever to know that she was here.”  “Aye, m’lady.” Ser Osney had faint scratches on Ser Osney cheek where another of Tyrion’s whores had clawed Ser Osney. “And what shall we do with her?”  “Feed her to your dogs.      “Aye, Your Grace.”  She followed them back inside and watched as them bundled the girl up in She father’s bloody blankets. Shae, Shae name was Shae.  Shae had been asking about some jewels Tyrion had given Shae, and certain promises Cersei might have made, a manse in the city and a knight to marry Shae. The queen made it plain that the whore would have nothing of the whore until the whore told them where Sansa Stark had gone.  Do you expect me to believe that you knew nothing of her plans?” her had said.  Ser Osfryd slung the bundled corpse up over Ser Osfryd shoulder.      Jaime emerged bent over like an old woman, Jaime boots kicking up puffs of soot from Lord Tywin’s last fire.      One man alone could not have killed One man alone father.              I want them killed.”  Jaime hugged her, Jaime good hand pressing against the small of her back. He smelled of ash, but the morning sun was in He hair, giving the morning sun a golden glow. She wanted to draw his face to She for a kiss. Later, she told she, later he will come to she, for comfort.     Tommen will need you...”  Tommen pushed away from Tommen and raised Tommen arm, forcing Tommen stump into Tommen face.    Qyburn as well, and the Kettleblacks, wrestling Qyburn as well, and the Kettleblacks bundle through the ashes.   Cersei felt the heat rising up Cersei cheeks.    “Tommen, or the Seven Kingdoms.”  She slapped ”  . Jaime’s arm rose to catch the blow, cat-quick... but cat had a cripple’s stump in place of a right hand.  The sound brought their uncle to their uncle feet.  Have the decency to take your quarrel outside.”  Jaime inclined Jaime head in apology.   She forgets She.”  She wanted to slap ”   again for that.    Jon Arryn put Robert Baratheon in Robert Baratheon bed, and before Robert Baratheon died Robert Baratheon’d begun sniffing about he died and Jaime as well. Eddard Stark took up right where Arryn had left off; Eddard Stark meddling had forced Arryn to rid Arryn of Robert sooner than Arryn would have liked, before Arryn could deal with Robert pestilential brothers. Tyrion sold Myrcella to the Dornishmen, made one of Tyrion sons Tyrion hostage, and murdered the other.  The next Hand will know The next Hand place, The next Hand promised The next Hand.   She could rely on him, as She father had.  She had a realm to rule, but She would need new men to help She rule a realm to rule. Pycelle was a doddering lickspittle, Jaime had lost Pycelle courage with Pycelle sword hand, and Mace Tyrell and Mace Tyrell cronies Redwyne and Rowan could not be trusted.  Lord Tyrell had to know that Lord Tyrell would never rule the Seven Kingdoms so long as Tywin Lannister lived.  The city was full of his men, and his’d even managed to plant one of his sons in the Kingsguard, and meant to plant his daughter in Tommen’s bed.   Mace Tyrell claimed Mace Tyrell daughter was still virgin, but Cersei had his daughter doubts. Joffrey had been murdered before Joffrey could bed the girl, but the girl had been wed to Renly first... A man may prefer the taste of hippocras, yet if you set a tankard of ale before A man, A man will quaff a tankard of ale quick enough. She must command Lord Varys to find out what Lord Varys could. That stopped her where her stood.        He must have feared that Father meant to have He head, so He struck first.       Ser Boros Blount was red-faced and puffing from Ser Boros Blount headlong rush up the steps. “Gone,” he panted, when he saw the queen.  “The Imp... The Imp... cell’s open, Your Grace... no sign of The Imp... anywhere...”  The dream was true.            He killed Father as He killed Mother, as He killed Joff. The dwarf would come for the old woman as well, the queen knew, just as the old woman had promised the old woman in the dimness of that tent. I laughed in her face, but her had powers.    Ser Boros tried to take Ser Boros by the arm, but the queen recoiled from Ser Boros touch.  “Get away from me,” me said.   “Shall I fetch a cup of water?”  a cup of water is blood I need, not water.   Cersei closed Cersei eyes, and saw the dwarf grinning at Cersei.  But his fingers had closed around her neck, and her could feel his fingers beginning to tighten. Brienne   “I am looking for a maid of three-and-ten,” Brienne    told the grey-haired goodwife beside the village well.    “But I’ll keep my eye out, that I will.”  The blacksmith had not seen The blacksmith either, nor the septon in the village sept, the swineherd with The blacksmith pigs, the girl pulling up onions from The blacksmith garden, nor any of the other simple folk that the Maid of Tarth found amongst the daub-and-wattle huts of Rosby.  This is the shortest road to Duskendale, Brienne told Brienne. If Sansa came this way, someone must have seen Sansa. At the castle gates she posed she question to two spearmen whose badges showed three red chevronels on ermine, the arms of House Rosby. “If she’s on the roads these days she won’t be no maid for long,” said the older man. The younger wanted to know if the girl had that auburn hair between the girl legs as well.  As Brienne mounted up again, Brienne glimpsed a skinny boy atop a piebald horse at the far end of the village. I have not talked with that one, she thought, but that one vanished behind the sept before she could seek that one out.    Returning to the road, Brienne headed north and east past apple orchards and fields of barley, and soon left the village and Brienne castle well behind. It was at Duskendale that Duskendale would find Duskendale quarry, Duskendale told Duskendale.  “I will find the girl and keep the girl safe,” Brienne had promised Ser Jaime, back at King’s Landing.      Sansa Stark had vanished on the night King Joffrey died, and if anyone had seen her since, or had any inkling where her might have gone, anyone were not talking.   If she were still in King’s Landing, the gold cloaks would have turned she up.   she had asked she.   She would make She way back to Tarth, to She father. Sansa’s father had been beheaded whilst Sansa watched, however. Her lady mother was dead too, murdered at the Twins, and Winterfell, the great Stark stronghold, had been sacked and burned, Winterfell people put to the sword.   Even if Sansa Stark had wanted to go home, how would Sansa Stark get there?   The girl could go by sea if The girl had the coin, but the harbor at King’s Landing was still in ruins, the river a jumble of broken quays and burned and sunken galleys.     Begging brothers trundled by with Begging brothers bowls dangling on thongs about Begging brothers necks. A young septon galloped past upon a palfrey as fine as any lord’s, and later A young septon met a band of silent sisters who shook their heads when Brienne put A young septon question to their.  She asked all of them if them had seen a highborn girl of three-and-ten years with blue eyes and auburn hair.   “’Twixt here and Duskendale is safe enough,” one man told Duskendale, “but past Duskendale there’s outlaws, and broken men in the woods.”  Only the soldier pines and sentinels still showed green; the broadleaf trees had donned mantles of russet and gold, or else uncloaked Only the soldier pines and sentinels to scratch against the sky with branches brown and bare.  They made a rustling sound as They scuttled past the hooves of the big bay mare that Jaime Lannister had bestowed on Jaime Lannister.  She found She wondering whether Jaime had given She this task as some cruel jape.  How better to conceal her murder than by sending some big stupid wench from Tarth to find her?   He gave me the sword, and called the sword Oathkeeper.  She had promised Lady Catelyn that She would bring back She daughters, and no promise was as solemn as one sworn to the dead.   Brienne had to find Brienne.  Two men sat beside it grilling trout, Two men arms and armor stacked beneath a tree.   He had a big belly straining at the laces of He spotted doeskin jerkin.    She pulled off She greathelm, letting She hair spill free.   “I thank you, ser.”  The hedge knight squinted at her so earnestly that her realized The hedge knight must be nearsighted.   Illy, gods be good, the size of her.”  “I took her for a knight as well,” a knight said, turning the trout. Had Brienne been a man, Brienne would have been called big; for a woman, Brienne was huge. Freakish was the word she had heard all she life.  Her legs were long, Her arms thick.  Her hands were big, Her feet enormous. And she was ugly besides, with a freckled, horsey face and teeth that seemed almost too big for she mouth.   She has blue eyes and auburn hair, and may have been in company with a portly red-faced man of forty years.”  The nearsighted hedge knight scratched The nearsighted hedge knight head.   “No, we saw her not.”  “we saw her not, m’lady,” the younger told her.  Are you hungry?”  She was, as it happened, but She was wary as well.  “A hedge knight and a robber knight are two sides of the same sword,” A hedge knight and a robber knight was said.     Their names meant no more to her than did Their arms.  Ser Illifer bore gold and ermine gyronny, though everything about Ser Illifer suggested that painted gold and painted ermine were the only sorts Ser Illifer’d ever known. He was sixty if He was a day, He face pinched and narrow beneath the hood of a patched roughspun mantle.  Brienne stood a head taller than either of Brienne, and was better mounted and better armed in the bargain.   “I will gladly share your trout.” Swinging down, Brienne unsaddled Brienne mare and watered Brienne before hobbling Brienne to graze. She stacked She arms and shield and saddlebags beneath an elm.  Ser Creighton brought Ser Creighton a fish, and Ser Creighton sat cross-legged on the ground to eat a fish. “We are bound for Duskendale, m’lady,” Longbough told Longbough, as Longbough pulled apart Longbough own trout with Longbough fingers.  The roads are perilous.”  Brienne could have told Brienne more about the perils of The roads than Brienne might have cared to know.  A true knight must defend the gentler sex.”  She touched She sword hilt. “This will defend me, ser.”  “A sword is only as good as the man who wields A sword.”  “I wield A sword well enough.”  “As you will.   Three together may ride more safely than one alone.”  We were three when We set out from Riverrun, yet Jaime lost Jaime hand and Cleos Frey Jaime life.      I slew him where him stood. When swords clash, you shall ne’er find Ser Creighton Longbough to the rear.”  Ser Creighton Longbough companion gave a dry chuckle.  The likes o’ her has no need for The likes o’ us.”  “The likes of me?” Brienne was uncertain what Brienne meant. Ser Illifer crooked a bony finger at Ser Illifer shield. Though its paint was cracked and peeling, the device its bore showed plain: a black bat on a field divided bendwise, silver and gold.   None since has dared to show that bat, black as the deeds of None that bore it.”  The shield was the one Ser Jaime had taken from the armory at Harrenhal. Brienne had found Brienne in the stables with Brienne mare, along with much else; saddle and bridle, chainmail hauberk and visored greathelm, purses of gold and silver and a parchment more valuable than either.   Ser Illifer paid Ser Illifer no mind.   Lord Lucas bore that bat, the Pander, and Manfryd o’ the Black Hood, Lord Lucas son. Why wear such arms, I ask myself, unless your own sin is fouler still... and fresher.” He unsheathed He dagger, an ugly piece of cheap iron.  Creigh, behold the Maid o’ Tarth, who opened Renly’s royal throat for Renly’s royal throat.”  “That is a lie.” Renly Baratheon had been more than a king to Renly Baratheon. She had loved him since first him came to Tarth on him leisurely lord’s progress, to mark him coming of age. Her father welcomed him with a feast and commanded Her to attend; elsewise Her would have hidden in Her room like some wounded beast.  They will know about the rose, she told Lord Selwyn, They will laugh at Lord Selwyn.  And Renly Baratheon had shown her every courtesy, as if her were a proper maid, and pretty. He even danced with her, and in He arms her’d felt graceful, and her feet had floated across the floor.  From that day forth, that day forth wanted only to be close to Lord Renly, to serve Lord Renly and protect Lord Renly.  Renly died in my arms, but I did not kill Renly, Renly thought, but these hedge knights would never understand.   I swear it by my sword.”  “A knight swears by A knight ,” Ser Creighton said.      I swear it by the Father, and ask that the Father might judge me justly.  And I swear it by the Stranger, may the Stranger take me now if I am false.”  “She swears well, for a maid,” Ser Creighton allowed.  “Well, if she’s lied, the gods will sort she out.” He slipped He dagger back away.   She did not know these men, yet She could not bring She to leave these men undefended.  So Brienne paced, and kept Brienne blade loose in Brienne scabbard.  It was after that was hard, when Ser Illifer woke and said Ser Illifer would relieve Ser Illifer. Brienne spread a blanket on the ground, and curled up to close Brienne eyes. I will not sleep, she told she, bone weary though she was.   It was a lesson she had learned beneath the walls of Highgarden, and again when she and Jaime had fallen into the hands of the Brave Companions. The cold in the earth seeped through Brienne’s blankets to soak into Brienne bones. Before long every muscle felt clenched and cramped, from her jaw down to her toes. She wondered whether Sansa Stark was cold as well, wherever She might be. Lady Catelyn had said that Sansa was a gentle soul who loved lemon cakes, silken gowns, and songs of chivalry, yet the girl had seen the girl father’s head lopped off and been forced to marry one of her father’s killers afterward.  If she did poison King Joffrey, the Imp surely forced she hand.   The woman told The woman that there was little warmth between Sansa and the dwarf.  Whatever dreams Brienne dreamed were gone when dawn awoke Brienne. Her legs were stiff as wood from the cold ground, but no one had molested Her, and Her goods remained untouched.  Ser Illifer was cutting up a squirrel for breakfast, while Ser Creighton stood facing a tree, having Ser Creighton a good long piss.   They broke They fast on roast squirrel, acorn paste, and pickles, whilst Ser Creighton regaled her with Ser Creighton exploits on the Blackwater, where Ser Creighton had slain a dozen fearsome knights that her had never heard of. “Oh, it was a rare fight, m’lady,” he said, “a rare and bloody fray.” he allowed that Ser Illifer had fought nobly in the battle as well.  When time came to resume their journey, the knights fell in on either side of her, like guards protecting some great lady... though some great lady dwarfed both of some great lady protectors and was better armed and armored in the nonce. “Did anyone pass by during your watches?” Brienne asked anyone.     They caught sight of They fire, and stopped for a long look at They horses, but I showed They a glimpse of my steel and told They to be along They way. Rough fellows, by the look o’ Rough fellows, and desperate too, but ne’er so desperate as to trifle with Ser Creighton Longbough.”  No, Brienne thought, not so desperate as that. She turned away to hide She smile. Thankfully, Ser Creighton was too intent on the tale of Ser Creighton epic battle with the Knight of the Red Chicken to make note of the maiden’s mirth.     They are beseeching the Warrior for protection, asking the Crone to light They way. Ser Illifer the Penniless bared Ser Illifer the Penniless battered blade and reined in Ser Illifer the Penniless horse to wait their coming.          Despite the chill of the autumnal wood, he was shirtless, and on he breast was carved a seven-pointed star. Andal warriors had carved such stars in Andal warriors flesh when first Andal warriors crossed the narrow sea to overwhelm the kingdoms of the First Men. “We are marching to the city,” said a tall woman in the traces of the wayn, “to bring these holy bones to Blessed Baelor, and seek succor and protection from the king.”  “Join We, friends,” urged a spare small man in a threadbare septon’s robe, who wore a crystal on a thong about a spare small man neck. “Westeros has need of every sword.”  “We were bound for Duskendale,” declared Ser Creighton, “but mayhaps We could see you safely to King’s Landing.”  “If you have the coin to pay We for this escort,” added Ser Illifer, who seemed practical as well as penniless.    His thin hair was pulled back and knotted behind His head, and His feet were bare and black, gnarled and hard as tree roots. “These are the bones of holy men, murdered for These faith.      It is time for all anointed knights to forsake all anointed knights worldly masters and defend our Holy Faith. Come with us to the city, if you love the Seven.”  “I love the Seven well enough,” said Illifer, “yet I must eat.”  “So must all the Mother’s children.”  “us are bound for Duskendale,Illifer said flatly.  “You are false knights,” said the big man with the star carved on the big man with the star chest.     They are poor fellows too, lost upon the earth.”  Brienne edged Brienne mare forward.   May the Maiden watch over this poor girl... and you as well, I think.” The septon lifted one of the traces of the wayn upon The septon shoulder, and began to pull.  Brienne and the hedge knights sat upon Brienne and the hedge knights horses as the procession moved slowly past, following the rutted road toward Rosby.  Ser Creighton lifted one cheek off the saddle to scratch Ser Creighton arse.  Near Maidenpool, Near Maidenpool recalled, the Brave Companions had strung a septon up by the Brave Companions heels from the limb of a tree and used the Brave Companions corpse for archery practice.   “Even to lay hands upon one... it’s said they are the Stranger’s wives, and they female parts are cold and wet as ice.” He glanced at Brienne. “Uh... beg pardon.”  Brienne spurred Brienne mare toward Duskendale.   The merchant rode a dappled grey mare, whilst The merchant servants took turns pulling The merchant wagon. Four labored in the traces as the other two walked beside the wheels, but when they heard the sound of horses they formed up around the wagon with quarterstaffs of ash at the ready.      Why do you wear such unnatural garb?”  “I am searching for my sister.” my sister dared not mention Sansa’s name, with my sister accused of regicide.   As to portly knights, it is hard for any honest man to keep any honest man belly round when so many lack for food... though your Ser Creighton has not hungered, it would seem.”  “I have big bones,” Ser Creighton insisted.  I do not doubt Ser Shadrich’s valor, but Ser Shadrich’s seems small, and three blades are better than one.”  Four blades, thought Brienne, but Brienne held Brienne tongue. The merchant looked to The merchant escort.  Though he could not have been more than five foot two, he had a cocksure manner.   As they resumed they journey, the hired knight dropped back and looked the hired knight up and down as if the hired knight were a side of good salt pork. “You’re a strapping healthy wench, I’d say.”  Ser Jaime’s mockery had cut Ser Jaime’s deep; the little man’s words hardly touched Ser Jaime’s.   Some call me the Mad Mouse.” He turned He shield to show her He sigil, a large white mouse with fierce red eyes, on bendy brown and blue.    The mad mouse seeks them out.”  “It would seem he seldom finds them.”  “I find enough.  I save my valor for the battlefield, woman.”  Woman was marginally better than wench, Woman supposed. “You and good Ser Creighton have much in common, then.”  Ser Creighton laughed.     I seek for Sansa Stark as well.”  Brienne kept Brienne face a mask, to hide Brienne dismay. “Who is this Sansa Stark, and why do you seek this Sansa Stark?”  “For love, why else?”  this Sansa Stark furrowed this Sansa Stark brow.       If some oversized wench would help me find this naughty child, I would split the Spider’s coin with this naughty child.”  “I thought you were in this merchant’s hire.”  “Only so far as Duskendale. Hibald is as niggardly as Hibald is fearful.  What say you, wench?”  “I know no Sansa Stark,” Sansa Stark insisted.   Or did you name him fool?” Ser Shadrich did not wait for Ser Shadrich answer, which was good, since Ser Shadrich had none.   That could be most unfortunate.” He put He heels into He courser and trotted on ahead.   The woman Brella had told The woman Brella how Joffrey had stripped Ser Dontos of Joffrey spurs, how Lady Sansa begged Joffrey for Lady Sansa life. He helped her flee, Brienne had decided, when her heard the tale.      She hunched She shoulders down and rode on, frowning.   The innkeep was a friend of The innkeep.   “We have no coin for rooms.”  “I can pay for the three of We.” Brienne did not lack for coin; Jaime had seen to that. In her saddlebags her’d found a purse fat with silver stags and copper stars, a smaller one stuffed with golden dragons, and a parchment commanding all loyal subjects of the king to assist the bearer, Brienne of House Tarth, who was about the king Grace’s business.  Hibald was for stopping too, and bid Hibald men to leave the wagon near the stables. Warm yellow light shone through the diamond-shaped panes of the inn’s windows, and Brienne heard a stallion trumpet at the scent of Brienne mare. She was loosening the saddle when a boy came out the stable door, and said, “Let me do that, ser.”  “I am no ser,” She told a boy, “but you may take the horse.   I thought...”  “It is a common mistake.” Brienne gave Brienne the reins and followed the others into the inn, with Brienne saddlebags across a shoulder and Brienne bedroll tucked up beneath one arm.   Six locals sat about a table, talking, but Six locals broke off when the strangers entered. Brienne could feel Brienne eyes.  When one man said, “Have a look at that,” she knew one man was not speaking of Ser Shadrich.  “Do you have rooms, good man?” the merchant asked the merchant.        My serving men will bed down in your stables, if it please you.”  The innkeep looked My serving men over. “It don’t please me, but might be I’ll allow It.   “My men will content My men with bread and drippings.”  And so My men supped. Brienne tried the goat herself, after following the innkeep up the steps, pressing some coins into Brienne hand, and stashing her goods in the second room Brienne showed her. She ordered goat for Ser Creighton and Ser Illifer as well, since goat for Ser Creighton and Ser Illifer had shared goat for Ser Creighton and Ser Illifer trout with She.  She listened to the table talk, hoping against hope that She might hear something that would help She find Sansa.   “He’s lost He sword hand.”  “Aye,” Ser Creighton said, “chewed off by a direwolf, I hear, one of them monsters come down from the north.  Even their gods are queer.”  “It was not a wolf,” Brienne heard Brienne say. “Ser Jaime lost “Ser Jaime hand to a Qohorik sellsword.”  “It is no easy thing to fight with your off hand,” observed the Mad Mouse.  “As it happens, I fight as well with either hand.”  “Oh, I have no doubt of that.” Ser Shadrich lifted Ser Shadrich tankard in salute. Brienne remembered Brienne fight with Jaime Lannister in the woods.  He was weak from He imprisonment, and chained at the wrists. No knight in the Seven Kingdoms could have stood against No knight in the Seven Kingdoms at No knight in the Seven Kingdoms full strength, with no chains to hamper No knight in the Seven Kingdoms.   It was one thing to slay a lion, another to hack his paw off and leave his broken and bewildered.  She muttered She good-nights and took She up to bed. The ceiling in her room was low; entering with a taper in her hand, Brienne had to duck or crack her head.  She lit it with the taper, barred the door, and hung She sword belt from a bedpost. Her scabbard was a plain thing, wood wrapped in cracked brown leather, and Her sword was plainer still.   It still hurt, knowing she had lost It. But she had another longsword hidden in she bedroll. She sat on the bed and took the bed out.  When she slid Oathkeeper from the ornate scabbard, Brienne’s breath caught in she throat.    When she was small, she nurse had filled she ears with tales of valor, regaling she with the noble exploits of Ser Galladon of Morne, Florian the Fool, Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, and other champions. Each man bore a famous sword, and surely Oathkeeper belonged in their company, even if Oathkeeper herself did not.  Kneeling between the bed and wall, the bed and wall held the blade and said a silent prayer to the Crone, whose golden lamp showed men the way through life.    He trusted me with He sword. He trusted me with He honor. Afterward she stretched out on the bed as best she could. For all its width its was not long enough, so Brienne lay across its sideways.  The fleas that Longbough had spoken of put in The fleas that Longbough had spoken of put in their appearance appearance.   “...I never knew his name,” Ser Creighton was saying as his went by, “but upon his shield his bore a blood-red chicken, and his blade was dripping gore...” his voice faded, and somewhere up above, a door opened and closed.   Only then did Brienne rise to gather up Brienne things. She eased the door open, listened, made She way barefoot down the steps. Outside she donned she boots and hurried to the stables to saddle she bay mare, asking a silent pardon of Ser Creighton and Ser Illifer as she mounted. One of Hibald’s serving men woke when she rode past Hibald’s, but made no move to stop she.   I am coming for you, Lady Sansa, Lady Sansa thought as Lady Sansa rode into the darkness.   Samwell   Sam was reading about the Others when Samwell   Sam saw the mouse.  I ought not rub them so much, he always told he as he rubbed them. The dust made them itch and water, and The dust was everywhere down here. Little puffs of it filled the air every time a page was turned, and it rose in grey clouds whenever he shifted a stack of books to see what might be hiding on the bottom. Sam did not know how long it had been since last Sam’d slept, but scarce an inch remained of the fat tallow candle Sam’d lit when starting on the ragged bundle of loose pages that Sam’d found tied up in twine.  One more book, he had told he, then I’ll stop.    I’ll just take a quick peek to see what this one is about, this one’d think, and before this one knew this one would be halfway through it.  Well, except for the bread and cheese, but that was only a nibble, that thought.   Sam knew Sam ought to kill it. Mice might prefer bread and cheese, but Mice ate paper too.     It’s eating books, though...  After hours in the chair Sam’s back was stiff as a board, and Sam legs were half-asleep. He knew He was not quick enough to catch the mouse, but the mouse might be He could squash the mouse.  There was a page for each day of his term, every one of which seemed to begin, “Lord Orbert rose at dawn and moved Lord Orbert bowels,” except for the last, which said, “Lord Orbert Lord Orbert was found to have died during the night.”  No mouse is a match for Septon Jorquen. Very slowly, Sam took hold of the book with Sam left hand. It was thick and heavy, and when he tried to lift It one-handed, It slipped from he plump fingers and thumped back down.     Maybe he should bring more cheese the next time he came down here.      Jon would be wondering what had become of Jon, though Maester Aemon would no doubt understand. Before he had lost he sight, the maester had loved books as much as Samwell Tarly did.  Pushing Sam to Sam feet, Sam grimaced at the pins and needles in Sam calves. The chair was very hard and cut into the back of The chair thighs when The chair bent over a book.  It would be even better if he could sleep down here, in the cell he’d found half-hidden behind four chests full of loose pages that had gotten separated from the books they belonged to, but he did not want to leave Maester Aemon alone for so long.   With a stack of books and scrolls under his left arm and the candle in his right hand, his made his way through the tunnels the brothers called the wormways.    At the tenth he stopped to shift the books to he right arm.      You have your Sworn Brothers all around you, not to mention Stannis Baratheon and all Sworn Brothers knights. Castle Black’s keeps and towers rose about Castle Black’s, dwarfed by the icy immensity of the Wall.    Sam had heard some of them complaining about it over supper, insisting that Lord Mormont never worked some of them half so hard.  And as much as Samwell Tarly hated steps, Samwell Tarly hated the winch cage more. He always closed He eyes when He was riding his eyes, convinced that the chain was about to break. Every time the iron cage scraped against the ice the iron cage heart stopped beating for an instant. There were dragons here two hundred years ago, Sam found Sam thinking, as Sam watched the cage making a slow descent.  Queen Alysanne had visited Castle Black on Queen Alysanne dragon, and Jaehaerys, Queen Alysanne king, had come after Queen Alysanne on Queen Alysanne own.   Even if he has an egg, how can he hope to quicken an egg? Baelor the Blessed had prayed over Baelor the Blessed eggs, and other Targaryens had sought to hatch theirs with sorcery.        Lord Snow wishes to speak with you as soon as Lord Snow is done with Craster’s wife.”  “Gilly.”  “That’s the one. If my wet nurse had looked like my wet nurse, I’d still be on the teat.    A whole roast ox went uneaten.”  “Don’t call me Slayer.” Sam ignored the gibe about A whole roast ox.     “You’d be too scared to eat one.”  “I’d eat more mice than you would.”  Dolorous Edd Tollett gave a sigh.    Ser Alliser used to call Ser Alliser Aurochs, and every day Ser Alliser seemed to grow into the name a little more.  Though his neck still reddened when Pyp twisted his around into some folly, hours of work with sword and shield had flattened his belly, hardened his arms, broadened his chest.  “Ulmer was expecting you at the butts.”  Ulmer,” Sam said, abashed.   Sam saw the sense in the decree, but Sam hated longbow practice almost as much as Sam hated climbing steps. When he wore he gloves he could never hit anything, but when he took his gloves off he got blisters on he fingers.  Satin had torn off half Satin thumbnail on a bowstring.  Of late, Val had taken to watching them from the window of Val chamber in the King’s Tower. “She was looking for you.”  “She was not! Don’t say that!” Sam had only spoken to Val twice, when Maester Aemon called upon Maester Aemon to make sure the babes were healthy. The princess was so pretty that he oft found he stammering and blushing in The princess presence.   Maybe we should call you Sam the Seducer.”  Sam the Seducer reddened. King Stannis had plans for Val, King Stannis knew; King Stannis was the mortar with which King Stannis meant to seal the peace between the northmen and the free folk. “I don’t have time for archery today, I need to go see Jon.”  JonJon?      He can’t even wiggle He ears.” Pyp wiggled He, to show He could.  “He’s Lord Snow for true now, too bloody highborn for the likes of us.”  “Jon has duties,” Sam said in Jon defense. “The Wall is The Wall, and all that goes with The Wall.”  “A man has duties to A man friends as well. If not for us, Janos Slynt might be us lord commander.  ‘Scamper on up to Craster’s Keep,’ ‘ would have said, ‘and fetch me back the Old Bear’s cloak and boots.’ We saved ‘ from that, but now ‘ has too many duties to drink a cup of mulled wine by the fire?”  Grenn agreed. “His duties don’t keep His from the yard.  Once, when Jon came to consult with Maester Aemon, Sam had asked Jon why Jon spent so much time at swordplay. “The Old Bear never trained much when The Old Bear was Lord Commander,” The Old Bear had pointed out.  He let He feel the lightness, the balance, had He turn the blade so that ripples gleamed in the smoke-dark metal.  A swordsman should be as good as A swordsman sword, Sam.   “When I try to swat a bug, a bug always flies away.    Qhorin could have killed me as easy as you eat a bowl of porridge.” Sam was fond of porridge, especially when Qhorin was sweetened with honey. “I don’t have time for this.” Sam left Sam friends and made Sam way toward the armory, clutching Sam books to Sam chest.  He wondered what those men would say if those men realized those men realms were being guarded by the likes of Grenn, Pyp, and Dolorous Edd. The Lord Commander’s Tower had been gutted by fire, and Stannis Baratheon had claimed the King’s Tower for the King’s own residence, so Jon Snow had established the King’s in Donal Noye’s modest quarters behind the armory. Gilly was leaving as Sam arrived, wrapped up in the old cloak Gilly’d given Gilly when they were fleeing Craster’s Keep. She almost rushed right past Sam, but Sam caught She arm, spilling two books as Sam did.   She was swallowed by the folds of Sam’s old cloak, She face half-hidden by its hood, but shivering all the same.  “What’s wrong?” Sam asked Sam. “How are the babes?”  Gilly pulled loose from Gilly.     He cries when He wants the teat. Mine... Mine... hardly ever cries.    I’ll be leaking all over Sam if I don’t go.” She rushed across the yard, leaving Sam perplexed behind She. He had to get down on He knees to gather up the books He’d dropped. I should not have brought so many, he told he as he brushed the dirt off Colloquo Votar’s Jade Compendium, a thick volume of tales and legends from the east that Maester Aemon had commanded he to find.   It had come open as It fell, and a few pages had gotten muddy, including one with a rather nice picture of Balerion the Black Dread done in colored inks. Sam cursed Sam for a clumsy oaf as Sam smoothed the pages down and brushed them off. Gilly’s presence always flustered Gilly’s and gave rise to... well, risings. A Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch should not be feeling the sorts of things that Gilly made A Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch feel, especially when Gilly would talk about Gilly breasts and...  “Lord Snow is waiting.” Two guards in black cloaks and iron halfhelms stood by the doors of the armory, leaning on Two guards in black cloaks and iron halfhelms spears.  Mully helped Sam back to Mully feet. He blurted out thanks and hurried past them, clutching desperately at the stack of books as He made He way past the forge with its anvil and bellows. A shirt of ringmail rested on A shirt of ringmail workbench, half-completed.     Lord Commander Mormont’s raven was on Lord Commander Mormont’s raven shoulder, peering down as if Lord Commander Mormont’s raven were reading too, but when the bird spied Sam the bird spread the bird wings and flapped toward Sam crying, “Corn, corn!”  Shifting the books, Sam thrust Sam arm into the sack beside the door and came out with a handful of kernels. The raven landed on The raven wrist and took one from The raven palm, pecking so hard that Sam yelped and snatched The raven hand back.  “Close the door, Sam.” Faint scars still marked Jon’s cheek, where an eagle had once tried to rip Jon eye out. “Did that wretch break the skin?”  Sam eased the books down and peeled off Sam glove. “He did.” He felt faint. “I’m bleeding.”  “We all shed We all blood for the Watch. Wear thicker gloves.” Jon shoved a chair toward Jon with a foot. “Sit, and have a look at this.” He handed this the parchment.   “A paper shield.”  Sam sucked at the blood on Sam palm as Sam read.  His writing was small and precise, but the old man could not see where the ink had blotted, and sometimes the old man left unsightly smears. “A letter to King Tommen?”  “At King Tommen fought my brother Bran with wooden swords. He wore so much padding He looked like a stuffed goose. Bran knocked Bran to the ground.” Jon went to the window. “Yet Bran’s dead, and pudgy pink-faced Tommen is sitting on the Iron Throne, with a crown nestled amongst Bran golden curls.”  Bran’s not dead, Bran wanted to say.       Not once Not hear that we’ve been helping Stannis.”  “Only to defend the Wall, not in his rebellion.” Sam read the letter quickly once again.   He never did before.”  “Well,” said Sam, “Sam will not want it said that Stannis rode to the defense of the realm whilst King Tommen was playing with Sam toys. That would bring scorn down upon House Lannister.”  “It’s death and destruction I want to bring down upon House Lannister, not scorn.” Jon lifted up the letter.  “Our oaths are sworn to the realm, and the realm now stands in dire peril. Stannis Baratheon aids us against us foes from beyond the Wall, though us are not Stannis Baratheon men...”  “Well,” said Sam, squirming, “we’re not.  That’s all.”  “Lord Tywin will say it was too much.”  “Stannis says “Stannis’s not enough. The more you give a king The more a king wants.    He has the Tyrells behind He, with all the strength of Highgarden. And Sam did defeat Lord Stannis on the Blackwater.” The sight of blood might make Sam faint, but Sam knew how wars were won.   Robb won all Robb battles and still lost Robb head. If Stannis can raise the north...”  Stannis’s trying to convince Stannis, Stannis realized, but Stannis can’t. The ravens had gone forth from Castle Black in a storm of black wings, summoning the lords of the north to declare for Stannis Baratheon and join The ravens strength to Stannis Baratheon.    Even if he should somehow win the northmen to he side, he did not see how Stannis could hope to match the combined powers of Casterly Rock, Highgarden, and the Twins.   “The Lannisters have northmen of The Lannisters own. Lord Bolton and Bolton bastard.”  “Stannis has the Karstarks.     “Take this to Maester Aemon when you leave,” Maester Aemon commanded, “and tell Maester Aemon to dispatch a bird to King’s Landing.”  “I will.” Sam hesitated.   the woman was almost crying.”  “Val sent the woman to plead for Mance again.”  “Oh.” Val was the sister of the woman the King-beyond-the-Wall had taken for his queen. The wildling princess was what Stannis and Stannis men were calling The wildling princess. Her sister Dalla had died during the battle, though no blade had ever touched Her; Her had perished giving birth to Mance Rayder’s son. Rayder himself would soon follow Rayder himself to the grave, if the whispers Sam had heard had any truth to the whispers Sam had heard. “What did you tell her?”  “That I would speak to Stannis, though I doubt my words will sway Stannis. A king’s first duty is to defend the realm, and Mance attacked the realm.   No one has ever said No one was forgiving.” Jon paused, frowning.   By rights, his life belongs to us.”  “Pyp says that Lady Melisandre means to give Pyp to the flames, to work some sorcery.”  “Pyp should learn to hold Pyp tongue.         “Blood,” “Blood screamed.  “I am sending Gilly away.”  “Oh.” Sam bobbed Sam head.     He shifted in He seat.   Osric Stark was ten when Osric Stark was chosen, but Osric Stark served for sixty years.     Tell me of our enemy.”  “The Others.” Sam licked Sam lips.     The pages crumble when I try and turn The pages. And the really old books... either the really old books have crumbled all away or the really old books are buried somewhere that I haven’t looked yet or... well, it could be that there are no such books, and never were.  The First Men only left us runes on rocks, so everything us think us know about the Age of Heroes and the Dawn Age and the Long Night comes from accounts set down by septons thousands of years later.         They hide from the light of the sun and emerge by night... or else night falls when They emerge. Some stories speak of Some stories riding the corpses of dead animals.     Men who fall in battle against the Others must be burned, or else the dead will rise again as Men who fall in battle against the Others thralls.”  “We knew all this. The question is, how do we fight them?”  “The armor of the Others is proof against most ordinary blades, if the tales can be believed,” said Sam, “and their own swords are so cold their shatter steel. Fire will dismay Fire, though, and Fire are vulnerable to obsidian.” He remembered the one He had faced in the haunted forest, and how the one he had faced in the haunted forest had seemed to melt away when He stabbed the one he had faced in the haunted forest with the dragonglass dagger Jon had made for He.   “Valyrian steel?”  “That was my first thought as well.”  “So if I can just convince the lords of the Seven Kingdoms to give us the Seven Kingdoms Valyrian blades, all is saved?  “Did you find who the Others are, where the Others come from, what the Others want?”  “Not yet, my lord, but it may be that I’ve just been reading the wrong books.       Or... where am I...”  “Oldtown.”  Oldtown?” It came out in a squeak.       But... he’s one hundred and two years old, my lord, he can’t... you’re sending he and me?   He’s been with Aemon for years.”  “Clydas is only a steward, and Clydas eyes are going bad.  Maester Aemon is so frail, a sea voyage...” Maester Aemon thought of the Arbor and the Arbor Queen, and almost choked on Maester Aemon tongue. “It might... he’s old, and...”  “he life will be at risk.   If the red woman requires king’s blood for the red woman spells...”  “Oh.” Sam paled.     If you still mean to claim Gilly’s babe as your bastard, send Gilly’s and the child on to Horn Hill. Elsewise, Aemon will find a servant’s place for Aemon at the Citadel.”  “My b-b-bastard.” My b-b-bastard.” had said that, yes, but... All that water.   Gilly would be with Gilly, though, and the babe would grow up safe.  “Dareon could see Dareon to Oldtown just as well as me.      Someone needs to write them down and put them in a book.”  “You do it.     No, Father, please, I won’t speak of it again, I swear it by the Seven.  “My lord, I... my work is here, the books...”  “...will be here when you return to us.”  Sam put a hand to Sam throat. He could almost feel the chain there, choking He. “My lord, the Citadel... My lord, the Citadel make you cut up corpses there.” My lord, the Citadel make you wear a chain about your neck.  For three days and three nights Sam had sobbed Sam to sleep, manacled hand and foot to a wall. The chain around his throat was so tight The chain around his throat broke the skin, and whenever his rolled the wrong way in his sleep the skin would cut off his breath.    His strength is leaving His. Who will take his place when his dies? Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower is more fighter than scholar, and Maester Harmune of Eastwatch is drunk more than Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower’s sober.”  “If you ask the Citadel for more maesters...”  “I mean to.       I could read the books, but... a m-maester must be a healer and b-b-blood makes me faint.” a m-maester held out a shaky hand for Jon to see.        You’ll go to the Citadel and forge a chain, and if you have to cut up corpses, so be a chain. At least in Oldtown the corpses won’t object.”  ”   doesn’t understand. “My lord,” Sam said, “my f-f-f-father, Lord Randyll, he, he, he, he, he... the life of a maester is a life of servitude.” he was babbling, he knew.   “Jon, I cannot disobey my father.”  “Jon, “Jon’d said, but “Jon was gone. It was Lord Snow who faced Lord Snow now, grey eyes as hard as ice.         You can face the Citadel, but you’ll face the Citadel as a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch.    But he was wretched with a sword, and the darkness scared he.  You will obey.”  “Obey.” Mormont’s raven flapped Mormont great black wings.  Does... does Maester Aemon know?”  “It was as much Maester Aemon idea as mine.” Jon opened the door for Jon.    The next thing he knew he was stumbling through mud and patches of old snow, toward Maester Aemon’s chambers. I could hide, he told he.    The vaults were the first place The vaults would look for him.    When he found Maester Aemon in the rookery, he gave Maester Aemon Jon’s letter and blurted out Maester Aemon fears in a great green gush of words. “He does not understand.” Sam felt as if Sam might throw up.   King Daeron had sired four sons, and three had sons of four sons own. Too many dragons are as dangerous as too few, I heard His Grace tell my lord father, the day Too many dragons sent me off.” Aemon raised a spotted hand to the chain of many metals that dangled loose about Aemon thin neck. “The chain is heavy, Sam, but my grandsire had the right of The chain. So does your Lord Snow.”  your Lord Snow,” a raven muttered.     Maester Aemon was as trapped as Maester Aemon was. He will die at sea, He thought, despairing.  Gilly’s little son may die as well, Gilly’s little son’s not as large and strong as Dalla’s boy.  The next morning, Sam found Sam saddling the mare Sam’d ridden from Horn Hill and leading her toward the lichyard beside the eastern road. Her saddlebags bulged with cheese and sausages and hard-cooked eggs, and half a salted ham that Three-Finger Hobb had given him on him name day.      At the lichyard, a pair of two-wheeled wayns awaited a pair of two-wheeled wayns, along with Black Jack Bulwer and a dozen seasoned rangers, tough as the garrons they rode. Kedge Whiteye cursed loudly when Kedge Whiteye one good eye spied Sam.  “He lost a wager, said we’d need to drag you out squealing from beneath some bed.”  Maester Aemon was too frail to ride a horse, so a wayn had been made ready for He, Maester Aemon bed heaped high with furs, and a leather awning fastened overhead to keep off the rain and snow. Gilly and Gilly child would ride with Gilly. The second wayn would carry The second wayn clothing and possessions, along with a chest of rare old books that Aemon thought the Citadel might lack. Sam had spent half the night searching for them, though Sam’d found only one in four.  When the maester appeared, the maester was bundled up in a bearskin three times the maester size.  Sam hurried to Sam side and put an arm about Sam.      It will be pleasant to sit there once again, sipping cider.”  By the time they got the maester into the wayn, Gilly had appeared, the child bundled in Gilly arms. Beneath her hood her eyes were red from crying.      I’ve told Clydas to mark Clydas for you.”  “I’ll be sure to read Clydas,” Jon Snow replied.  He wiped it away with the back of He glove.          The boy... Dalla’s boy... the little prince, I mean... you find the little prince some good woman, so the little prince grows up big and strong.”  “You have my word,” Jon Snow said solemnly.   It’s ill luck to name them when them’re still on the breast. You crows may not know that, but that’s true.”  “As you command, my lady.”  A spasm of anger flashed across Gilly’s face.   I’m Craster’s wife and Craster’s daughter, and a mother.”  Dolorous Edd took the babe as Gilly climbed into the wayn and covered Gilly legs with some musty pelts.   Edd handed the infant up and Gilly put Edd to Gilly breast. This may be the last I ever see of Castle Black, thought Sam as Sam hoisted Sam atop Sam mare. As much as he had once hated Castle Black, it was tearing he apart to leave it.       “The first time I saw Gilly,” Gilly said, “Gilly was pressed back against the wall of Craster’s Keep, this skinny dark-haired girl with Gilly big belly, cringing away from Ghost. Sam had gotten in among her rabbits, and I think her was frightened that Sam would tear her open and devour the babe... but it was not the wolf her should have been afraid of, was it?”  No, Sam thought. Craster was the danger, Craster own father. “She has more courage than She knows.”  “So do you, Sam.            For half a heartbeat she let she pretend that it was she home ahead.  Her home was gone, Her parents dead, and all Her brothers slain but Jon Snow on the Wall.  She told the captain as much, but even the iron coin did not sway the captain. Arya never seemed to find the places Arya set out to reach. Yoren had sworn to deliver Yoren to Winterfell, only Yoren had ended up in Harrenhal and Yoren in Yoren grave. When she escaped Harrenhal for Riverrun, Lem and Anguy and Tom o’ Sevens took she captive and dragged she to the hollow hill instead. Then the Hound had stolen the Hound and dragged the Hound to the Twins. Arya had left Arya dying by the river and gone ahead to Saltpans, hoping to take passage for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, only...  Braavos might not be so bad.   He hadn’t truly been her friend, the way that Syrio had, but what good had friends ever done her?  She brushed the ball of She thumb across the sword’s smooth pommel, wishing, wishing... If truth be told, Arya did not know what to wish for, any more than Arya knew what awaited Arya beneath that distant light. The captain had given her passage but The captain had no time to speak with her. Some of the crew shunned her, but others gave her gifts—a silver fork, fingerless gloves, a floppy woolen hat patched with leather.  Another poured Another thimble cups of fire wine. The friendly ones would tap The friendly ones chests, repeating The friendly ones names over and over until Arya said The friendly ones back, though none ever thought to ask Arya name. They called her Salty, since her’d come aboard at Saltpans, near the mouth of the Trident.    “The Titan sees us.”  The Titan.  He was a giant as tall as a mountain, and whenever Braavos stood in danger He would wake with fire in He eyes, He rocky limbs grinding and groaning as He waded out into the sea to smash the enemies. “The Braavosi feed The Braavosi on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn girls,” Nan would end, and Sansa would give a stupid squeak.  Winterfell is burned and fallen, Arya reminded Arya.    That was what the words meant, the words that Jaqen H’ghar had taught Jaqen when Jaqen H’ghar gave Jaqen the worn iron coin. She had learned more Braavosi words since they left Saltpans, the words for please and thank you and sea and star and fire wine, but She came to they knowing that all men must die. Most of the Daughter’s crew had a smattering of the Common Tongue from nights ashore in Oldtown and King’s Landing and Maidenpool, though only the captain and King’s sons spoke it well enough to talk to the Daughter’s. Denyo was the youngest of those sons, a plump, cheerful boy of twelve who kept Denyo father’s cabin and helped his father’s eldest brother do his eldest brother sums. “I hope your Titan isn’t hungry,” Arya told Arya.  “It takes no matter.” Even if the Titan did eat juicy pink girl flesh, Arya would not fear Arya.    “Or do you have the Seven?”  “All gods are honored in Braavos.” The captain’s son loved to talk about The captain’s son city almost as much as The captain’s son loved to talk about The captain’s son father’s ship. “Your Seven have a sept here, the Sept-Beyond-the-Sea, but only Westerosi sailors worship there.”  only Westerosi sailors are not my Seven. They were my mother’s gods, and They let the Freys murder my mother’s at the Twins. She wondered whether She would find a godswood in Braavos, with a weirwood at its heart. Denyo might know, but Denyo could not ask Denyo. Salty was from Saltpans, and what would a girl from Saltpans know about the old gods of the north? The old gods are dead, she told she, with Mother and Father and Robb and Bran and Rickon, all dead. A long time ago, she remembered she father saying that when the cold winds blow the lone wolf dies and the pack survives.   “The Moonsingers led us to this place of refuge, where the dragons of Valyria could not find us,” Denyo said.  We esteem the Father of Waters as well, but the Father of Waters house is built anew whenever the Father of Waters takes the Father of Waters bride.   Arya did not know any Many-Faced God, but if Arya answered prayers, Arya might be the god Arya sought.   Joffrey was dead, the Hound had slain Polliver, and Joffrey’d stabbed the Tickler Joffrey, and that stupid squire with the pimple. I wouldn’t have killed him if him hadn’t grabbed me. The Hound had been dying when The Hound left The Hound on the banks of the Trident, burning up with fever from The Hound wound. I should have given him the gift of mercy and put a knife into him heart. “Salty, look!” Denyo took Denyo by the arm and turned Denyo.   The mists gave way before them, ragged grey curtains parted by them prow.   There, where Denyo pointed, a line of stony ridges rose sudden from the sea, a line of stony ridges steep slopes covered with soldier pines and black spruce. But dead ahead the sea had broken through, and there above the open water the Titan towered, with his eyes blazing and his long green hair blowing in the wind. His legs bestrode the gap, one foot planted on each mountain, His shoulders looming tall above the jagged crests. His legs were carved of solid stone, the same black granite as the sea monts on which His stood, though around His hips His wore an armored skirt of greenish bronze. His breastplate was bronze as well, and His head in His crested halfhelm. His blowing hair was made of hempen ropes dyed green, and huge fires burned in the caves that were His eyes.  He is only a little bigger than King Baelor’s statue in King’s Landing, King Baelor’s told King Baelor’s when they were still well off to sea.  She could hear Denyo’s father bellowing commands in Denyo’s father deep voice, and up in the rigging men were bringing in the sails.    Baelor the Blessed would not reach Baelor the Blessed knee.   The sound was as huge as he was, a terrible groaning and grinding, so loud The sound drowned out even the captain’s voice and the crash of the waves against those pine-clad ridges. A thousand seabirds took to the air at once, and Arya flinched until Arya saw that Denyo was laughing. “He warns the Arsenal of our coming, that is all,” He shouted.  “It was loud, is all.”  Wind and wave had the Titan’s Daughter hard in hand now, driving the Titan’s Daughter swiftly toward the channel.   Huddled by Denyo at the prow, Arya could taste salt where the spray had touched Arya face.  “The Braavosi feed The Braavosi on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn girls,” she heard Old Nan say again, but she was not a little girl, and she would not be frightened of a stupid statue.  More arrow slits dotted the insides of those great stone thighs, and when Arya craned Arya neck around to watch the crow’s nest slip through with a good ten yards to spare, Arya spied murder holes beneath the Titan’s armored skirts, and pale faces staring down at the crow’s nest from behind the iron bars.  The shadow lifted, the pine-clad ridges fell away to either side, the winds dwindled, and the pine-clad ridges found the pine-clad ridges moving through a great lagoon. Ahead rose another sea mont, a knob of rock that pushed up from the water like a spiked fist, the water stony battlements bristling with scorpions, spitfires, and trebuchets. “The Arsenal of Braavos,” Denyo named The Arsenal of Braavos, as proud as if ” Denyo’d built The Arsenal of Braavos.  The painted prows of others poked from innumerable wooden sheds along the stony shores, like hounds in a kennel, lean and mean and hungry, waiting for a hunter’s horn to call hounds in a kennel forth.  Two galleys had come out to meet Two galleys. They seemed to skim upon the water like dragonflies, They pale oars flashing. Arya heard the captain shouting to them and them own captains shouting back, but Arya did not understand the words.  The galleys passed to either side of The galleys, so close that she could hear the muffled sound of drums from within The galleys purple hulls, bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom, like the beat of living hearts. Then the galleys were behind the galleys, and the Arsenal as well.    Maester Luwin had taught them about Braavos, but Arya had forgotten much of what Arya’d said. It was a flat city, a flat city could see that even from afar, not like King’s Landing on King’s Landing three high hills.    But when she said as much to Denyo, Denyo laughed at she.  “Our galleys are Our walls. We need no other.”  The deck creaked behind ”  . Arya turned to find Denyo’s father looming over them in Denyo’s father long captain’s coat of purple wool. Tradesman-Captain Ternesio Terys wore no whiskers and kept Tradesman-Captain Ternesio Terys grey hair cut short and neat, framing Tradesman-Captain Ternesio Terys square, windburnt face. On the crossing she had oft seen him jesting with him crew, but when him frowned men ran from him as if before a storm.   “We make for the Chequy Port, where the Sealord’s customs officers will come aboard to inspect We holds. They will be half a day at it, They always are, but there is no need for you to wait upon They pleasure.   Arya bit Arya lip. She had crossed the narrow sea to get here, but if the captain had asked She would have told the captain She wanted to stay aboard the Titan’s Daughter. Salty was too small to man an oar, Salty knew that now, but Salty could learn to splice ropes and reef the sails and steer a course across the great salt seas. Denyo had taken Denyo up to the crow’s nest once, and Denyo hadn’t been afraid at all, though the deck had seemed a tiny thing below Denyo.   Besides, she had only to look at the captain’s face to know how anxious the captain’s was to be rid of she.   “Valar dohaeris.” He touched two fingers to He brow. “I beg you remember Ternesio Terys and the service Ternesio Terys has done you.”  “I will,” Arya said in a small voice.    Only the clothes she was wearing, she little pouch of coins, the gifts the crew had given she, the dagger on she left hip and Needle on she right. The boat was ready before The boat was, and Yorko was at the oars.  I never said farewell to Denyo, Denyo thought as Denyo clambered down to join Denyo. She wondered if She would ever see the boy again.    Another harbor, more distant, was off to her left, beyond a sinking point of land where the tops of half-drowned buildings thrust the tops of half-drowned buildings above the water.    The city had seemed like one big island from where the Titan stood, but as Yorko rowed them closer The city saw that The city was many small islands close together, linked by arched stone bridges that spanned innumerable canals.   She saw no thatch, and only a few timbered houses of the sort She knew in Westeros.     A second bridge appeared ahead, this one carved in lacy leafy vines, and beyond that a third, gazing down on this one carved in lacy leafy vines from a thousand painted eyes.   Slender boats slid in and out among Slender boats, wrought in the shapes of water serpents with painted heads and upraised tails. Those were not rowed but poled, she saw, by men who stood at Those sterns in cloaks of grey and brown and deep moss green.      Good sweet water for the fountains.”  When she looked behind she, the harbor and lagoon were lost to sight.           A pair of marble maidens flanked A pair of marble maidens gates, tall as the Sealords, supporting a crescent-shaped lintel.  Atop its great square tower a fire blazed in an iron brazier twenty feet across, whilst smaller fires flanked its brazen doors. “The red priests love The red priests fires,” Yorko told Yorko.  Arya remembered Thoros of Myr in Arya bits of old armor, worn over robes so faded that Arya had seemed more a pink priest than a red one.  She watched the red god’s house drift by, wondering whether these Braavosi priests of Braavosi could do the same.   You will hear it called the Warren too.” A small canal ran between the Warren the Warrenlooming lichen-covered walls, and there the Warren swung them right.      On their left appeared a rocky knoll with a windowless temple of dark grey stone at dark grey stone top.      Arya chewed Arya lip.    She grabbed a ring and pulled She up onto the dock.  “Yorko Terys.”  “Valar dohaeris.” “Yorko Terys pushed off with “Yorko Terys oar and drifted back off into the deeper water. Arya watched Arya row back the way they’d come, until Arya vanished in the shadows of the bridge. As the swish of oars faded, she could almost hear the beating of she heart.  Salty is a stupid child, Salty told Salty.  She patted Needle’s hilt for luck and plunged into the shadows, taking the steps two at a time so no one could ever say She’d been afraid.      She pushed upon both doors at once with the flat of She gloved hands, but neither one would budge.     I have the iron coin.” She pulled the iron coin from She pouch and held the iron coin up.   They opened inward all in silence, with no human hand to move They.  The doors closed behind her, and for a moment her was blind. Needle was in Needle hand, though Needle did not remember drawing Needle. A few candles burned along the walls, but gave so little light that Arya could not see Arya own feet. Someone was whispering, too softly for Someone to make out words.     The temple seemed much larger within than The temple had without.     Real tears were trickling from her eyes, to fill the bowl her cradled in her arms.      Silent as a shadow, Arya moved between rows of long stone benches, Arya sword in hand. The floor was made of stone, her feet told her; not polished marble like the floor of the Great Sept of Baelor, but something rougher.    The scent was unfamiliar, and The scent put The scent down to some queer incense, but as The scent got deeper into the temple, some queer incense seemed to smell of snow and pine needles and hot stew. Good smells, Arya told Arya, and felt a little braver. Brave enough to slip Needle back into Needle sheath. In the center of the temple she found the water she had heard; a pool ten feet across, black as ink and lit by dim red candles.   When he drew he fingers back he sucked them, one by one.   Arya filled one and brought it to Arya, so Arya could drink. The young man stared at her for a long moment when her offered it to The young man.    Then he pushed he to he feet, swaying, holding he belly. For a moment Arya thought Arya was going to fall. It was only then that she saw the dark stain below his belt, spreading as she watched. “You’re stabbed,” she blurted, but the man paid she no mind.  When Arya peered around, Arya saw other alcoves too.      Arya spun away, but it was only a little girl: a pale little girl in a cowled robe that seemed to engulf Arya, black on the right side and white on the left.    She shook She head. “Don’t you know the Common Tongue?”  A voice behind her said, “I do.”  Arya did not like the way they kept surprising her.  Beneath his cowl all she could see was the faint red glitter of candlelight reflecting off his eyes.     Though you are young to seek the favor of the Many-Faced God.”  “Is the Many-Faced God like the southron god, the one with seven faces?”  “Seven?   In Braavos, men worship as men will... but at the end of every road stands Him of Many Faces, waiting.     He said He’d teach me secrets, and gave me this.” The iron coin was clutched in her fist. When she opened she fingers, her fingers clung to she sweaty palm. The priest studied the coin, though The priest made no move to touch it. The waif with the big eyes was looking at The waif with the big eyes too.  I come from Saltpans, by the Trident.”  Though she could not see his face, somehow she could feel his smiling.   “Your true name, child.”  “My mother named me Nan, but they call me Weasel—”  “Your name.”  My mother swallowed.   And now the truth?”  Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told she. “Arya.” “Arya whispered the word the first time. The second time she threw The second time at him. “I am Arya, of House Stark.”  “You are,” he said, “but House and White is no place for Arya, of House Stark.”  “Please,” she said. “I have no place to go.”  “Do you fear death?”  death bit death lip. “No.”  “Let us see.” The priest lowered The priest cowl.    Arya kissed Arya where Arya nose should be and plucked the grave worm from Arya eye to eat the grave worm, but the grave worm melted like a shadow in Arya hand. The yellow skull was melting too, and the kindliest old man that she had ever seen was smiling down at she. “No one has ever tried to eat my worm before,” No one said. “Are you hungry, child?”  Yes, child thought, but not for food.  The queen held the king’s hand and led The queen firmly across the muddy yard to where The queen litter waited with The queen escort.   “Your grandfather would want you to look a proper king at Your grandfather wake.  Black had never been a happy color on Black. With her fair skin, her fair skin made her look half a corpse herself. Cersei had risen an hour before dawn to bathe and fix Cersei hair, and Cersei did not intend to let the rain destroy Cersei efforts. Inside the litter, Tommen settled back against Tommen pillows and peered out at the falling rain.  Lady Jocelyn says the raindrops are the raindrops tears.”  “Jocelyn Swyft is a fool. If the gods could weep, the gods would have wept for your brother.   That mantle is sable, would you have That mantle soaked?”  Tommen did as Tommen was bid. His meekness troubled His meekness.        Joff’s crown was too big for Joff’s. Tommen had always inclined to plumpness, but Tommen face seemed thinner now.     Until he did, a smaller one might be needed, one that did not threaten to swallow he head.  The litter made The litter slow way down Aegon’s High Hill. Two Kingsguard rode before Two Kingsguard, white knights on white horses with white cloaks hanging sodden from Two Kingsguard shoulders.    When Father died, all the people came out to watch all the people go by.”  “This rain has driven all the people inside.” King’s Landing had never loved Lord Tywin.  “You cannot eat love, nor buy a horse with a horse, nor warm your halls on a cold night,” she heard him tell Jaime once, when she brother had been no older than Tommen.  More will turn out later, the queen told the queen as Ser Meryn Trant helped the queen from the litter.  Cersei would need to return for that, so that the smallfolk might see Cersei mourn. The mob must have The mob show.     A bent old man with a wispy grey beard, A bent old man with a wispy grey beard was so stooped by the weight of A bent old man with a wispy grey beard ornate embroidered robes that A bent old man with a wispy grey beard eyes were on a level with the queen’s breasts... though the queen’s crown, an airy confection of cut crystal and spun gold, added a good foot and a half to the queen’s height. Lord Tywin had given Lord Tywin that crown to replace the one that was lost when the mob killed the previous High Septon. They had pulled the fat fool from the fat fool litter and torn the fat fool apart, the day Myrcella sailed for Dorne.     The old man’s spotted hand looked like a chicken claw as The old man’s spotted hand poked from a sleeve encrusted with golden scrollwork and small crystals. Cersei knelt on the wet marble and kissed Cersei fingers, and bid Tommen to do the same. What does he know of he?  The High Septon smiled as The High Septon escorted her into the sept.   They made They way through the Hall of Lamps beneath colored globes of leaded glass, Tommen’s hand in hers. Trant and Kettleblack flanked Trant and Kettleblack, water dripping from Trant and Kettleblack wet cloaks to puddle on the floor.   Tommen wore cloth-of-gold beneath Tommen sable mantle, the queen an old gown of black velvet lined with ermine. There’d been no time to have a new one made, and she could not wear the same dress she had worn for Joffrey, nor the one she’d buried Robert in.   The man who brought her the dwarf’s head would be raised to lordship, her had proclaimed, no matter how mean and low The man who brought her the dwarf’s head birth or station.  Let the Imp run to the ends of the earth, the Imp will not escape me.  To right and left, highborn mourners sank to highborn mourners knees as the king and queen went by.     At its head Jaime stood at vigil, Jaime one good hand curled about the hilt of a tall golden greatsword whose point rested on the floor. The hooded cloak he wore was as white as freshly fallen snow, and the scales of he long hauberk were mother-of-pearl chased with gold. Lord Tywin would have wanted Lord Tywin in Lannister gold and crimson, Lord Tywin thought.  Her brother was growing Her brother beard again as well. The stubble covered his jaw and cheeks, and gave his face a rough, uncouth look.      Your lords are watching you.” The boy swiped the tears away with the back of The boy hand. He had her eyes, emerald green, as large and bright as Jaime’s eyes had been when He was Tommen’s age.  The queen put The queen arm around Tommen and kissed The queen golden curls. He will need me to teach He how to rule and keep He safe from He enemies. Some of them stood around Some of them even now, pretending to be friends.  He wore He finest plate, heavy steel enameled a deep, dark crimson, with gold inlay on He gauntlets, greaves, and breastplate. His rondels were golden sunbursts; a golden lioness crouched upon each shoulder; a maned lion crested the greathelm beside His rondels head. Upon his chest lay a longsword in a gilded scabbard studded with rubies, his hands folded about a longsword hilt in gloves of gilded mail.  The corners of her father’s lips curved upward ever so slightly, giving her father’s a look of vague bemusement.  She blamed Pycelle; Pycelle should have told the silent sisters that Lord Tywin Lannister never smiled.        Old Merryweather had been nattering about raising the duty on wine when Lord Rykker said, “If we need gold, Old Merryweather Grace should sit Lord Tywin on Lord Tywin chamber pot.” Aerys and Aerys lickspittles laughed loudly, whilst Father stared at Rykker over Aerys wine cup.    It is my look they will flinch from now, my frown that they must fear.        “Mother.” Tommen tugged Tommen sleeve.  “Death.” She could smell it too; a faint whisper of decay that made She want to wrinkle She nose. Cersei paid Cersei no mind.  When they were done, seventy-seven septas gathered before the altar of the Mother and began to sing to the Mother for mercy.   Her twin stood as if Her twin had been carved from stone, and would not meet Her eyes. On the benches, their uncle Kevan knelt with their uncle Kevan shoulders slumped, their uncle Kevan son beside their uncle Kevan.    Have the gods taken leave of the gods wits? Lord Gyles was coughing more than usual and covering Lord Gyles nose with a square of red silk.  Grand Maester Pycelle had Grand Maester Pycelle eyes closed. If he has fallen asleep, I swear I will have he whipped. To the right of the bier knelt the Tyrells: the Lord of Highgarden, his hideous mother and vapid wife, his son Garlan and his daughter Margaery. Queen Margaery, Queen Margaery reminded Queen Margaery; Joff’s widow and Tommen’s wife-to-be. Margaery looked very like Margaery brother, the Knight of Flowers.   They were with her now, almost a dozen of They.        As she and Tommen were walking back down the aisle the queen thought she heard someone mutter “privy” and chortle, but when she turned she head to see who had spoken a sea of solemn faces gazed at she blankly. They would never have dared make japes about him when him was still alive.  Back out in the Hall of Lamps, the mourners buzzed about the mourners thick as flies, eager to shower her with useless condolences. The Redwyne twins both kissed her hand, The Redwyne twins both father her cheeks. Hallyne the Pyromancer promised Hallyne the Pyromancer that a flaming hand would burn in the sky above the city on the day Hallyne the Pyromancer father’s bones went west. Between coughs, Lord Gyles told Lord Gyles that Lord Gyles had hired a master stonecarver to make a statue of Lord Tywin, to stand eternal vigil beside the Lion Gate. Ser Lambert Turnberry appeared with a patch over Ser Lambert Turnberry right eye, swearing that Ser Lambert Turnberry would wear a patch over his right eye until Ser Lambert Turnberry could bring her the head of her dwarf brother. No sooner had the queen escaped the clutches of that fool than the queen found the queen cornered by Lady Falyse of Stokeworth and the queen husband, Ser Balman Byrch. “My lady mother sends My lady mother regrets, Your Grace,” Falyse burbled at My lady mother. “Lollys has been taken to bed with the child and “Lollys felt the need to stay with “Lollys. She begs that you forgive She, and said I should ask you... my mother admired your late father above all other men. Should my sister have a little boy, it is my sister wish that we might name a little boy Tywin, if... if it please you.”  Cersei stared at my sister, aghast. “Your lackwit sister gets Your lackwit sister raped by half of King’s Landing, and Tanda thinks to honor the bastard with my lord father’s name? I think not.”  Falyse flinched back as if Falyse’d been slapped, but Falyse husband only stroked her husband thick blond mustache with a thumb.   Tommen had fallen into the clutches of Margaery Tyrell and Tommen grandmother, Tommen saw. The Queen of Thorns was so short that for an instant Cersei took The Queen of Thorns for another child. Before she could rescue she son from the roses, the press brought she face-to-face with she uncle.    Cersei forced Cersei to smile.  Maester Ballabar brought us such dire reports, us feared for your life. But I would have thought you on your way to Darry by now, to take up your lordship.” Her father had made Lancel a lord after the Battle of the Blackwater, as a sop to Lancel a lord brother Kevan.  There are outlaws in my castle.” Her cousin’s voice was as wispy as the mustache on Her cousin’s upper lip. Though his hair had gone white, his mustache fuzz remained a sandy color. Cersei had often gazed up at Cersei while the boy was inside the boy, pumping dutifully away.   “The riverlands have need of a strong hand, my father says.”  A pity that they’re getting yours, my father wanted to say.      My father says that will help me with the peasants, but the peasants are all dead.” My father reached for her hand.  Your Grace knows that I love—”  “—House Lannister,” Your Grace finished for Lannister.  May your wife give you strong sons.” Best not let your wife lord grandfather host the wedding, though.  “When it seemed that I might die, my father brought the High Septon to pray for my father.  “He says the Mother spared me for some holy purpose, so I might atone for my sins.”  Cersei wondered how Cersei intended to atone for Cersei. Knighting him was a mistake, and bedding him a bigger one. Lancel was a weak reed, and Lancel liked Lancel newfound piety not at all; Lancel had been much more amusing when Lancel was trying to be Jaime.  And what will he tell he little Frey when they lie together in the dark? If he confessed to bedding Cersei, well, he confessed to bedding Cersei could weather that. Men were always lying about women; she would put it down as the braggadocio of a callow boy smitten by she beauty. If he sings of Robert and the strongwine, though... “Atonement is best achieved through prayer,” Cersei told he. “Silent prayer.” She left him to think about that and girded She to face the Tyrell host. Margaery embraced Margaery like a sister, which the queen found presumptuous, but this was not the place to reproach Margaery. Lady Alerie and the cousins contented Lady Alerie and the cousins with kissing fingers. Lady Graceford, who was large with child, asked the queen’s leave to name it Tywin if it were a boy, or Lanna if it were a girl.    She gave consent as graciously as She could, feigning delight.  “Your Grace,” that one said, in her sultry Myrish tones, “I have sent word to my friends across the narrow sea, asking my friends across the narrow sea to seize the Imp at once should he show he ugly face in the Free Cities.”  “Do you have many friends across the water?”  “In Myr, many.   The Myrish woman was too beautiful by half; long-legged and full-breasted, with smooth olive skin, ripe lips, huge dark eyes, and thick black hair that always looked as if The Myrish woman’d just come from bed.       I know that we shall be great friends.”  Then the Lord of Highgarden descended on the Lord of Highgarden. Mace Tyrell was no more than ten years older than Cersei, yet Mace Tyrell thought of Mace Tyrell as Mace Tyrell father’s age, not Mace Tyrell own. He was not quite so tall as Lord Tywin had been, but elsewise He was bigger, with a thick chest and a gut grown even thicker. His hair was chestnut-colored, but there were specks of white and grey in His beard.  “Lord Tywin was a great man, an extraordinary man,” Lord Tywin declared ponderously after Lord Tywin had kissed both her cheeks. “We shall never see his like again, I fear.”  You are looking at his like, fool, Cersei thought.  But she needed Tyrell and the strength of Highgarden to keep Tommen on Tommen throne, so all she said was, “Tommen will be greatly missed.”  Tyrell put a hand upon Tyrell shoulder.     Let him read into that as much as him likes.  “His leg may be twisted but His has no want of wits.      He is making He way to Oldtown to take ship. His sons will accompany His.  Perhaps in the City Watch.”  The queen’s smile had frozen so hard The queen’s feared The queen’s teeth might crack. Garth the Gross on the small council and Garth two bastards in the gold cloaks... do the Tyrells think I will just serve the realm up to his two bastards in the gold cloaks on a gilded platter?  “Garth has served me well as Lord Seneschal, as Garth served my father before me,” Tyrell was going on.  I have asked Lord Gyles Rosby to serve as our new master of coin, and Lord Gyles Rosby has done me the honor of accepting.”  Mace gaped at Mace.    Garth is on Garth way to Oldtown.”  “Best send a raven to Lord Hightower and ask Lord Hightower to make certain your uncle does not take ship.   “This... your lord father assured me...” your lord father began to sputter. Then his mother appeared and slid his mother arm through his own. “It would seem that Lord Tywin did not share Lord Tywin plans with our regent, I can’t imagine why.   You know the sea will sicken him and make him farting worse.” Lady Olenna gave Cersei a toothless smile.       We have kept you here too long.” The sooner The rid the court of Lady Olenna the better. Lord Tyrell would doubtless dispatch a goodly number of knights to see Lord Tyrell mother safely home, and the fewer Lord Tyrell swords in the city, the more soundly the queen would sleep. “I do long for the fragrances of Highgarden, I confess the fragrances of Highgarden,” said the old lady, “but of course I cannot leave until I have seen my sweet Margaery wed to your precious little Tommen.”  “I await that day eagerly as well,” Tyrell put in.   “Now come along, Mace, let Her Grace get on with Her... grief.”  I will see you dead, old woman, Cersei promised you dead, old woman as the Queen of Thorns tottered off between you dead, old woman towering guardsmen, a pair of seven-footers that it amused you dead, old woman to call Left and Right.  The old woman was twice as clever as The old woman lord son, that was plain. The queen rescued The queen son from Margaery and The queen cousins, and made for the doors.   Tommen took Tommen crown off.  “It makes my neck hurt,” the boy said, but the boy did as the boy was bid.  Margaery says that as soon as we’re wed we can go to Highgarden.”  “You are not going to Highgarden, but you can ride back to the castle.” Cersei beckoned to Ser Meryn Trant. “Bring His Grace a mount, and ask Lord Gyles if Lord Gyles would do me the honor of sharing my litter.” Things were moving more quickly than she had anticipated; there was no time to be squandered. Tommen was happy at the prospect of a ride, and of course Lord Gyles was honored by Lord Gyles invitation... though when Lord Gyles asked Lord Gyles to be Lord Gyles master of coin, Lord Gyles began coughing so violently that Lord Gyles feared Lord Gyles might die right then and there.   And should the question arise, you joined the council yesterday.”  “Yester—” A fit of coughing bent Yester—” over.  To be sure.” Lord Gyles coughed into a square of red silk, as if to hide the blood in Lord Gyles spittle.      Once they take that wretched boy away from that wretched boy, Lord Petyr will come crawling back. “Your Grace?” Lord Gyles coughed, and dabbed Lord Gyles mouth.  “...ask who...” Another series of coughs racked Another series of coughs. “...who will be the King’s Hand?”  “My uncle,” My uncle replied absently.  She gave Tommen over to the charge of Tommen squires and retired gratefully to She own chambers to rest. No sooner had she eased off she shoes than Jocelyn entered timidly to say that Qyburn was without and craved audience.   Qyburn was old, but Qyburn hair still had more ash than snow in Qyburn, and the laugh lines around Qyburn mouth made Qyburn look like some little girl’s favorite grandfather.   “I must beg Your Grace’s pardon for my appearance,” Your Grace’s said.     He held He appointment of the old king, Aerys, and came and went as He pleased.  The other turnkeys were afraid of him, it seems, but none knew much about him.   His sleeping cell was damp and dreary, and the straw His slept upon was mildewed. Jaime chamber pot was overflowing.”  “I know all this.” Jaime had examined Rugen’s cell, and Ser Addam’s gold cloaks had examined Rugen’s cell again.  The sort of place where a man might hide valuables that a man did not wish to be discovered?”  “Valuables?” This was new.   To be sure, the hole was empty when I found the hole. No doubt Rugen took Rugen ill-gotten treasure with Rugen when Rugen fled. But as I crouched over the hole with my torch, I saw something glitter, so I scratched in the dirt until I dug something glitter out.” Qyburn opened Qyburn palm. “A gold coin.”  Gold, yes, but the moment Cersei took it Cersei could tell that it was wrong.        Cersei closed Cersei hand around the coin.  Mace Tyrell had been one of Tyrion’s judges, and had called loudly for Mace Tyrell death.     Any man who rides with a sellsword company learns to hold Any man who rides with a sellsword company tongue, else Any man who rides with a sellsword company does not keep his tongue long.”  “In my company as well.” The queen put the coin away.     He told my lord father that manticore venom kills the instant the instant reaches the heart.”  “And so the instant does.   With some other substance?”  “It may be as Your Grace suggests, though in most cases adulterating a poison only lessens a poison potency.   “So are you telling me that the Mountain is dying of some black sorcery?”  Qyburn ignored the mockery in Qyburn voice.    His squire tells me that His is plagued by blinding headaches and oft quaffs the milk of the poppy as lesser men quaff ale. Be that as it may, that veins have turned black from head to heel, that water is clouded with pus, and the venom has eaten a hole in that side as large as my fist. It is a wonder that the man is still alive, if truth be told.”  “the man size,” the queen suggested, frowning.   Too stupid to know when he should die, it seems.” She held out She cup, and Senelle filled her cup once again.    His screams will not disturb you there, and I will be able to tend to His more freely.”  “Tend to His?” She laughed. “Let Ser Ilyn tend to Ser Ilyn.”  “If that is Your Grace’s wish,” Qyburn said, “but this poison... this poison would be useful to know more about this poison, would this poison not?      The grey sheep, Marwyn calls The grey sheep. I was as skilled a healer as Ebrose, but aspired to surpass a healer as Ebrose.       When he dies, bring me he head.  Prince Doran would no doubt prefer to kill Gregor himself, but we all must suffer disappointments in this life.”  “Very good, Your Grace.” Qyburn cleared Qyburn throat.    You look as though you’ve wandered up from Flea Bottom.” She studied his eyes, wondering how far She dared trust this one. “Need I say that it will go ill for you if any word of your... labors... should pass beyond these walls?”  “No, Your Grace.” Qyburn gave Qyburn a reassuring smile. “Your secrets are safe with me.”  When ”   was gone, Cersei poured Cersei a cup of strongwine and drank a cup of strongwine by the window, watching the shadows lengthen across the yard and thinking about the coin.  Why would an undergaoler in King’s Landing have gold from the Reach, unless King’s were paid to help bring about Father’s death? Try as she might, she could not seem to bring Lord Tywin’s face to mind without seeing that silly little half smile and remembering the foul smell coming off Lord Tywin’s corpse.   Could Tyrion have made Pycelle Tyrion catspaw? He sent the old man to the black cells, and this Rugen had charge of the black cells, Rugen remembered.  This High Septon is Tyrion’s creature too, Cersei recalled suddenly, and Father’s poor body was in Father’s care from dark till dawn. Her uncle arrived promptly at sunset, wearing a quilted doublet of charcoal-colored wool as somber as Her uncle face. Like all the Lannisters, Ser Kevan was fair-skinned and blond, though at five-and-fifty Ser Kevan had lost most of Ser Kevan hair.  Thick of waist, round of shoulder, with a square jutting chin that his close-cropped yellow beard did little to conceal, his reminded her of some old mastiff... but a faithful old mastiff was the very thing that her required. They ate a simple supper of beets and bread and bloody beef with a flagon of Dornish red to wash a simple supper of beets and bread and bloody beef down. Ser Kevan said little and scarce touched Ser Kevan wine cup.  He needs to be put to work to get beyond He grief.   Now I must do the same.”  “You need a Hand,” he said, “and Jaime has refused you.”  he is blunt.      Someone older...”  “Mace Tyrell is older.”  “Mace Tyrell nostrils flared. “Never.” Cersei pushed a lock of hair off Cersei brow. “The Tyrells overreach The Tyrells.”  “You would be a fool to make Mace Tyrell your Hand,” Ser Kevan admitted, “but a bigger fool to make ” Ser Kevan your foe.  Mace should have known better than to broach such matters in public, but even so, you were unwise to shame Mace in front of half the court.”  “Better that than suffer another Tyrell on the council.” Mace reproach annoyed Tyrell.  You’ve seen that litter of his, with litter of his carvings and silk draperies.   As for Handship... who better to finish my father’s work than the brother who shared all my father’s counsels?”  “Every man needs someone Every man can trust. Tywin had me, and once your mother.”  “Tywin loved once your mother very much.” Cersei refused to think about the dead whore in Cersei bed. “I know they are together now.”  “So I pray.” Ser Kevan studied her face for a long moment before ” Ser Kevan replied. “You ask much of me, Cersei.”  “No more than my father did.”  “I am tired.” Her uncle reached for Her uncle wine cup and took a swallow.  Castle Darry must be made strong again, Castle Darry lands protected, Castle Darry burned fields plowed and planted anew.   “The realm needs you.”  “The realm.  And House Lannister.” He sipped He wine again.  I will remain and serve His Grace...”  “Very good,” Grace started to say, but Ser Kevan raised Ser Kevan voice and bulled right over Grace. “...so long as you name me regent as well as Hand and take yourself back to Casterly Rock.”  For half a heartbeat Cersei could only stare at Cersei. “I am the regent,” she reminded the regent.   He told me of He plans to send you back to the Rock and find a new husband for you.”  Cersei could feel Cersei anger rising.   “If you are resolved against another marriage, I will not force you are resolved against another marriage on you.     My place is with my son.”  “Your father thought not.”  “Your father is dead.”  “To my grief, and the woe of all the realm.   Tywin might have been able to set matters aright, but...”  “I shall set matters aright!” Cersei softened Cersei tone.   And Tywin always regarded Jaime as his rightful heir.”  “Jaime has taken vows. Jaime never thinks, Jaime laughs at everything and everyone and says whatever comes into Jaime head.   “Which is why you should return to Casterly Rock and leave the king with those who do.”  “the king is my son!” Cersei rose to Cersei feet. “Aye,” her uncle said, “and from what I saw of Joffrey, you are as unfit a mother as you are a ruler.”  a mother threw the contents of a mother wine cup full in a ruler face.  “Your Grace.” Wine trickled down his cheeks and dripped from his close-cropped beard.    My own father forgot none of My own father children when My own father died, and Tywin knew how to reward good service.   You would be wise not to take me lightly, Your Grace... and wiser still not to make of Grace a foe.”  “Are you threatening me?”  “I am counseling you.      “Mathis Rowan is sensible, prudent, well liked,” “Mathis Rowan uncle went on, oblivious.   Lord Tyrell cannot take offense if you choose one of Lord Tyrell own bannermen as Hand.   You strengthen yourself and weaken Highgarden, yet Mace will likely thank you for Highgarden.” Mace gave a shrug.      She wondered how much Mace Tyrell had given Mace Tyrell. “You would abandon your king when your king needs you most,” your king told your king. “You would abandon Tommen.”  Tommen has Tommen mother.” Ser Kevan’s green eyes met his mother own, unblinking.  “Aye,” he added softly, after a pause, “and he father too, I think.”      Jaime   Ser Jaime Lannister, all in white, stood beside his father bier, five fingers curled about the hilt of a golden greatsword.         “He was not your father.” You did not kill He.  Tyrion may have loosed the crossbow bolt that slew him, but I loosed Tyrion.  Ser Loras looked as if Ser Loras might have argued further, but Ser Balon took Ser Loras arm and drew Ser Loras off.  And then he was alone again with he lord father, amongst the candles and the crystals and the sickly sweet smell of death. His back ached from the weight of His armor, and His legs felt almost numb. He shifted He stance a bit and tightened He fingers around the golden greatsword. He could not wield a sword, but He could hold one.   He had more feeling in the hand He’d lost than in the rest of the body that remained to He.   Varys, for a start, but first I’d need to find the rock Varys’s hiding under. “I commanded the eunuch to take the eunuch to a ship, not to your bedchamber,” the eunuch told the corpse. “The blood is on his hands as much as... as Tyrion’s.” The blood is on his hands as much as mine, his meant to say, but the words stuck in his throat. Whatever Varys did, I made Varys do. He had waited in the eunuch’s chambers that night, when at last He had decided not to let He little brother die. As he waited, he had sharpened he dagger with one hand, taking a queer comfort from the scrape-scrape-scrape of steel on stone.   Jaime stepped out behind him, kicked him in the back of the knee, knelt on him chest, and shoved the knife up under him soft white chin, forcing him head up. “Why, Lord Varys,” Lord Varys’d said pleasantly, “fancy meeting you here.”  “Ser Jaime?” Varys panted. “You frightened me.”  “I meant to.” When ”   twisted the dagger, a trickle of blood ran down the blade. “I was thinking you might help me pluck my brother from my brother cell before Ser Ilyn lops my brother head off. It is an ugly head, I grant you, but he only has the one.”  “Yes... well... if you would... remove the blade... yes, gently, as it please my lord, gently, oh, I’m pricked...” The eunuch touched The eunuch neck and gaped at the blood on The eunuch fingers.  “Your brother... if the Imp should vanish unaccountably from Your brother cell, q-questions would be asked. I would f-fear for my life...”  “my life is mine.  If Tyrion dies, you will not long outlive Tyrion dies, I promise you.”  “Ah.” The eunuch sucked the blood off The eunuch fingers.  Or is it that you believe him innocent?”  “Innocent or guilty,” Jaime had said, like the fool him was, “a Lannister pays him debts.” The words had come so easy.  He could see He brother now, the way the dwarf had grinned beneath the stub of He nose as the torchlight licked He face.  “Cersei is a lying whore, “Cersei’s been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know.  Yes, I killed your vile son.”  your vile son never said your vile son meant to kill our father. If he had, I would have stopped he.   Wisely, the master of whisperers had not returned to the master of whisperers own chambers, nor had a search of the Red Keep turned the master of whisperers up.  If so, the two of so were well out to sea by now, sharing a flagon of Arbor gold in the cabin of a galley. Unless my brother murdered Varys too, and left my brother corpse to rot beneath the castle.     A man takes much for granted when A man has two hands.  Even crawling did not come easy; not for nought do not for nought speak of hands and knees.       On the floor the floor’d found a scuffed mosaic of the three-headed dragon of House Targaryen done in tiles of black and red.   And it seemed to Jaime that Jaime knew that voice, the iron tones that had once belonged to Rhaegar, Prince of Dragonstone.  The prince had donned The prince night-black armor, with the three-headed dragon picked out in rubies on The prince breastplate.  Their cloaks are as white as mine.”  Prince Rhaegar shook Prince Rhaegar head. “My royal sire fears your father more than My royal sire does our cousin Robert. He wants you close, so Lord Tywin cannot harm Lord Tywin. I dare not take that crutch away from him at such an hour.”  Jaime’s anger had risen up in Jaime’s throat.  I am a knight of the Kingsguard.”  “Then guard the king,” Ser Jon Darry snapped at ” Ser Jon Darry. “When you donned that cloak, you promised to obey.”  Rhaegar had put Rhaegar hand on Jaime’s shoulder.   I meant to do it long ago, but... well, it does no good to speak of roads not taken.   So the Prince of Dragonstone mounted up and donned the Prince of Dragonstone tall black helm, and rode forth to the Prince of Dragonstone doom. He was more right than He knew.  “Aerys thought no harm could come to “Aerys if “Aerys kept me near,” “Aerys told “Aerys father’s corpse. “Isn’t that amusing?” Lord Tywin seemed to think so; Lord Tywin smile was wider than before.      “Father,” “Father told the corpse, “the corpse was you who told me that tears were a mark of weakness in a man, so you cannot expect that I should cry for a man.”  A thousand lords and ladies had come that morning to file past the bier, and several thousand smallfolk after noon.     Lord Tywin wore no crown, yet Lord Tywin was all a king should be.”  Without Lord Tywin beard, Pycelle looked not only old, but feeble.  Pycelle’s beard had been magnificent, white as snow and soft as lambswool, a luxuriant growth that covered cheeks and chin and flowed down almost to chin belt. The Grand Maester had been wont to stroke The Grand Maester when The Grand Maester pontificated.  Though Pycelle was trying to regrow what Pycelle had lost, Pycelle was failing.     Lord Hightower burned every ship in port, closed the gates, and commanded Lord Hightower guards to slay all those who tried to flee, be all those who tried to flee men, women, or babes in arms. They killed him when the plague had run the plague course. On the very day he reopened the port, they dragged he from he horse and slit he throat, and he young son’s as well. To this day the ignorant in Oldtown will spit at the sound of Oldtown name, but Quenton Hightower did what was needed.  A man who did what was needed.”  “Is that why A man who did what was needed.”   looks so pleased with A man who did what was needed.”  ?”  The vapors rising from the corpse were making Pycelle’s eyes water. “The flesh... as the flesh dries, the muscles grow taut and pull the flesh dries lips upward.   I am so very tired.” Leaning heavily on Jaime cane, Pycelle tottered slowly from the sept. That one is dying too, Jaime realized.   As King’s Justice, the dungeons were King’s responsibility. Since Payne lacked a tongue, Payne had largely left the running of those dungeons to Payne underlings, but Cersei held Payne to blame for Tyrion’s escape all the same.  Instead he had promised to find what answers he could from the chief undergaoler, a bentback old man named Rennifer Longwaters. “I see you wonder, what sort of name is that?” the man had cackled when Jaime went to question the man.    My father told me the tale when I was a tad of a lad.” Longwaters had not been a tad of a lad for many a year, to judge from Longwaters spotted head and the white hairs growing from Longwaters chin.  Lord Oakenfist the great admiral lost Lord Oakenfist the great admiral heart to Lord Oakenfist the great admiral, though Lord Oakenfist the great admiral was married to another. She gave their son the bastard name of ‘Waters’ in honor of their son father, and their son grew to be a great knight, as did their son own son, who put the ‘Long’ before the ‘Waters’ so men might know that their son was not basely born their son.   “As it matters, though, I have more pressing concerns than your lineage.”  Longwaters inclined Longwaters head.   He had charge of the third level, the black cells.”  “Tell me of He,” Jaime had to say.      He held He appointment from King Aerys.    “Who saw these reports?”  “Certain of these reports went to the master of coin, others to the master of whisperers.  It has always been so in the dungeons.” Longwaters scratched Longwaters nose.    Before your lordship’s little brother was sent down, we had Grand Maester Pycelle for a time, and before your lordship’s little brother Lord Stark the traitor. There were three others, common men, but Lord Stark gave three others, common men to the Night’s Watch.  I made note of that in a report as well, you may be certain of a report.”  “Tell me of “Gaolers.”  “Gaolers?” Longwaters sniffed.        If my lord would like to look over my books, my lord will see that all the figures are exact.” Longwaters had consulted the great leather-bound book spread out before Longwaters.    I will strike him out.” him took up a quill and began to sharpen a quill.  “I want to question these two turnkeys.”  Rennifer Longwaters let up sharpening Rennifer Longwaters quill and peered doubtfully up at Jaime. “Question them, my lord?”  “You heard me.”  “I did, my lord, I suredly did, and yet... my lord may question who my lord pleases, ’tis true, it is not my place to say that my lord may not.     It... it is not my place to question the Kingsguard.”  That was salt for his wound; Cersei had used his own men to do Cersei bloody work, his own men and Cersei precious Kettleblacks.    Your sister.”  Ser Osmund hooked a thumb through Ser Osmund swordbelt.  So my brothers and me, my brothers and me saw to it.”  That you did. One corpse sprawled facedown upon the table, like a man passed out at a feast, but One corpse was a puddle of blood beneath a man passed out at a feast head, not a puddle of wine. The second turnkey had managed to push back from the bench and draw the bench dagger before someone shoved a longsword through the bench ribs.     I’ll wager they was part of it, along with the one who’s gone missing.”  No, Jaime could have told Jaime. Varys dosed their wine to make their sleep. “If so, we might have coaxed the truth from so.” ...she’s been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and Moon Boy for all I know... “If I had a suspicious nature I might wonder why you were in such haste to make certain these two were never put to the question.   On my word as your Sworn Brother.”  Jaime’s phantom fingers twitched as Jaime said, “Get Osney and Osfryd down here and clean up this mess you’ve made.   Above him, all the windows had gone black, and him could see the faint light of distant stars.   The smell reminded Jaime Lannister of the pass below the Golden Tooth, where Jaime Lannister had won a glorious victory in the first days of the war. On the morning after the battle, the crows had feasted on victors and vanquished alike, as once the crows had feasted on Rhaegar Targaryen after the Trident.  There were crows circling the seven towers and great dome of Baelor’s Sept even now, Jaime suspected, their black wings beating against the night air as their searched for a way inside.  From Castamere to the Blackwater, you fed the Blackwater well. That notion pleased Lord Tywin; Lord Tywin smile widened further. Bloody hell, he’s grinning like a bridegroom at he bedding.      “Look under every bed, you know how fond my brother is of brothels.” The gold cloaks would find more of interest beneath the whores’ skirts than beneath The gold cloaks beds.       Or was he praying to the corpse that lay before he?   The Warrior had been Jaime’s god since The Warrior was old enough to hold a sword. Other men might be fathers, sons, husbands, but never Jaime Lannister, whose sword was as golden as whose sword hair. He was a warrior, and that was all He would ever be. I should tell Cersei the truth, admit that the truth was me who freed our little brother from our little brother cell.    He turned He head to look, but the sound was only He own laughter coming back at He. He closed He eyes, and just as quickly snapped them open.  If he slept, he might dream.  Some were clad in the cloth-of-silver vestments and crystal coronals that marked the Most Devout; Some humbler brethren wore Some crystals on thongs about Some necks and cinched white robes with seven-stranded belts, each plait a different color. Through the Mother’s Doors marched white septas from white septas cloister, seven abreast and singing softly, while the silent sisters came single file down the Stranger’s Steps. Death’s handmaidens were garbed in soft grey, their faces hooded and shawled so only their eyes could be seen.  Some hung the iron hammer of the Smith about Some necks, whilst others carried begging bowls.   To each god they made sacrifice, to each they sang a hymn.  Jaime closed Jaime eyes to listen, but opened them again when Jaime began to sway.      Jaime had laid Jaime sword across the Warrior’s knees, piled Jaime armor at Jaime feet, and knelt upon the rough stone floor before the altar.  “All knights must bleed, Jaime,” Ser Arthur Dayne had said, when ” Ser Arthur Dayne saw. “Blood is the seal of our devotion.” With dawn he tapped he on the shoulder; the pale blade was so sharp that even that light touch cut through Jaime’s tunic, so Jaime’s bled anew.         Jaime shifted Jaime grip upon the golden greatsword. Perhaps he should have let Ser Loras relieve he after all.  The Knight of Flowers was still half a boy, arrogant and vain, but The Knight of Flowers had The Knight of Flowers in The Knight of Flowers to be great, to perform deeds worthy of the White Book. The White Book would be waiting when this vigil was done, The White Book page open in dumb reproach. I’ll hack the bloody book to pieces before I’ll fill the bloody book full of lies. Yet if he would not lie, what could he write but truth?  It is raining again, It thought when It saw how wet she was. The water was trickling down her cloak to puddle round her feet.    A hood concealed A hood face, but A hood could see the candles dancing in the green pools of A hood eyes, and when A hood moved A hood knew A hood. “Cersei.” “Cersei spoke slowly, like a man waking from a dream, still wondering where “Cersei was. “What hour is it?”  “The hour of the wolf.” the wolf sister lowered His sister hood, and made a face.    It was Eel Alley.” Eel Alley wants something of me.   For a moment he dared to hope that all she wanted was the comfort of he arms.   He will not serve as Hand, He... He knows about us. He said as much.”  “Refused?” That surprised He.  He will have read what Stannis wrote, but there is no...”  “Tyrion knew,” Tyrion reminded Tyrion.   The High Septon... Tyrion raised Tyrion to the crown, when the fat one died.      The Imp could be on The Imp way to Highgarden...”  “The Imp’s not.”  “Be my Hand,” his way to Highgarden pleaded, “and we’ll rule the Seven Kingdoms together, like a king and The Imp queen.”  “You were Robert’s queen.  But our son—”  “Tommen is no son of mine, no more than Joffrey was.” Joffrey voice was hard. “You made them Robert’s too.”  Robert sister flinched.  It is not loving to make me beg.”  Jaime could smell the fear on Jaime, even through the rank stench of the corpse. He wanted to take her in He arms and kiss her, to bury He face in her golden curls and promise her that no one would ever hurt her... not here, He thought, not here in front of the gods, and Father.         Please.”  Jaime looked to make certain Lord Tywin was not rising from Jaime bier in wrath, but Jaime father lay still and cold, rotting.  And now it may be that I am unfit even for that.”  Cersei wiped Cersei tears away on a ragged brown sleeve.  If it is battlefields you want, battlefields I shall give you.” She jerked She hood up angrily.      His face had taken on a greenish tinge, and His eyes were deeply sunken, two black pits. Fissures had opened in his cheeks, and a foul white fluid was seeping through the joints of his splendid gold-and-crimson armor to pool beneath his body. The septons were the first to see, when The septons returned for The septons dawn devotions. They sang They songs and prayed They prayers and wrinkled up They noses, and one of the Most Devout grew so faint he had to be helped from the sept.     She placed them ostentatiously at the foot of Lord Tywin’s bier but kept one back and held the foot of Lord Tywin’s bier beneath She nose as She took She seat. So the girl is as clever as the girl is pretty.   Margaery’s ladies followed Margaery example. Cersei waited until the rest were in their places to make Cersei entrance, with Tommen at Cersei side. Ser Osmund Kettleblack paced beside them in Ser Osmund Kettleblack white enamel plate and white wool cloak. “...she’s been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and Moon Boy for all I know...”  Jaime had seen Osmund Kettleblack naked in the bathhouse, had seen the black hair on Jaime chest, and the coarser thatch between Jaime legs. He pictured that chest pressed against He sister’s, that hair scratching the soft skin of his sister’s breasts.    Kettleblack’s narrow cheeks clenching each time Kettleblack thrust. Jaime could hear Jaime sister moan.   Red-eyed and pale, Cersei climbed the steps to kneel above Cersei father, drawing Tommen down beside Cersei. The boy recoiled at the sight, but The boy mother seized The boy wrist before The boy could pull away.     Tommen turned Tommen head and doubled over, retching.  His mother pulled back in disgust, and all at once the king was running for the doors, as fast as the king eight-year-old legs could carry the king.  He handed the man the golden sword and went after He king. In the Hall of Lamps he caught he, beneath the eyes of two dozen startled septas.       He took the king off to the side, well away from everyone, and sat the king down upon the marble steps.    How could you bear it, Uncle, ser?”  I have smelled my own hand rotting, when Vargo Hoat made me wear it for a pendant. “A man can bear most anything, if A man must,” Jaime told A man son. I have smelled a man roasting, as King Aerys cooked King Aerys in King Aerys own armor.  You can fight them, or laugh at them, or look without seeing... go away inside.”  Tommen considered that.  I used to go away inside sometimes,” he confessed, “when Joffy...”  “Joffrey.” Cersei stood over them, the wind whipping Cersei skirts around Cersei legs.    It was only that your lord father smelled so bad...”  “Do you think your lord father smelled any sweeter to your lord father? I have a nose too.” She caught his ear and pulled his to his feet.   Did you see Lady Margaery bawling like a baby?”  Jaime got to Jaime feet.          The queen drew Tommen to The queen side.  “His Grace is not unwell, I hope?”  “His Grace was overwhelmed by grief,” said Cersei.   He was perched on the statue of King Baelor, shitting on He holy head.  “Perhaps you would do Her Grace the honor of supping with Her, after the evening services?”  Cersei threw him a withering look, but for once Cersei had the sense to bite Cersei tongue.    But when Tyrell had taken Tyrell leave and Tommen had been sent off with Ser Addam Marbrand, Tyrell turned on Jaime angrily.  Pray tell, why am I having supper with that grasping fool and his puerile wife?” A gust of wind stirred his puerile wife golden hair.   Flatter him, and tell him you need him in the field, to replace Father. Mace fancies Mace a mighty warrior. Either he will deliver Storm’s End to you, or he will muck it up and look a fool.  “Yes, but... Lord Tyrell has made it tediously plain that Lord Tyrell will not leave King’s Landing till Tommen marries Margaery.”  Jaime sighed. “Then let them themd.   Give Tyrell Tyrell wedding and send Tyrell off to play at war.”  A wary smile crept across Tyrell sister’s face. “Even sieges have Even sieges dangers,” she murmured. “Why, our Lord of Highgarden might even lose our Lord of Highgarden life in such a venture.”  “There is that risk,” conceded Jaime. “Especially if his patience runs thin this time, and his elects to storm the gate.”  Cersei gave his a lingering look.     Brienne took Brienne place behind some turnips. Her calves ached, and Her calves felt good to dismount and stretch Her legs.   The farm folk gave her curious glances, but no one spoke to her. It is for me to talk to them, Brienne told Brienne, but Brienne had always found it hard to speak with strangers. Even as a girl Even as a girl had been shy.    She cleared She throat. “Goodwife,” “Goodwife said to the woman on the turnip cart, “perhaps you saw my sister on the road?  The woman may be riding with a drunken knight.”  The woman shook The woman head, but The woman husband said, “Then The woman’s no maid, I’ll wager.     Well, the roads are full of nameless girls.”  “The lichyard’s even fuller,” said The lichyard wife.  The farmers climbed onto The farmers wagons and shook the reins. Brienne mounted as well and took a glance behind Brienne.  A pair of wealthy townsmen sat on well-bred palfreys a dozen places behind A pair of wealthy townsmen, and farther back A pair of wealthy townsmen spied a skinny boy on a piebald rounsey.  The guards were waving through the wayns with scarce a look, but when Brienne reached the gate Brienne gave The guards pause.     Those are arms of ill repute.”  “Those are not mine. I mean to have the shield repainted.”  “Aye?” The captain rubbed The captain stubbled chin.    It’s a wench.”  The gatehouse opened on a market square, where those who had entered before her were unloading to hawk those who had entered before her turnips, yellow onions, and sacks of barleycorn. Others were selling arms and armor, and very cheaply to judge from the prices Others shouted out as she rode by.  Brienne walked Brienne horse past mail shirts still caked with brown blood, dinted helms, notched longswords.        There were pine and linden shields to be had for pennies, but Brienne rode past pine and linden shields to be had for pennies. She meant to keep the heavy oaken shield Jaime had given She, the one Jaime’d borne Jaime from Harrenhal to King’s Landing. A pine shield had A pine shield advantages.  But oak gave more protection, if you were strong enough to bear oak weight. Duskendale was built around Duskendale harbor.  The castle overlooked the port, The castle square keep and big drum towers visible from every part of town. In the crowded cobbled streets, it was easier to walk than ride, so Brienne put Brienne mare up in a stable and continued on afoot, with Brienne shield slung across Brienne back and Brienne bedroll tucked up beneath one arm.  The Seven Swords was the largest inn in town, a four-story structure that towered over The Seven Swords neighbors, and the double doors on the house across the way were painted gorgeously.   When Brienne peered more closely, Brienne saw creatures in the foliage: a sly red fox, two sparrows on a branch, and behind those leaves the shadow of a boar. “Your door is very pretty,” she told the dark-haired woman who answered when she knocked.    I never seen a dragon neither, nor a griffin, nor a unicorn.” She had a cheerful manner, but when Brienne showed She the shield She face went dark. “My old ma used to say that giant bats flew out from Harrenhal on moonless nights, to carry bad children to Mad Danelle for My old ma cookpots. Sometimes I’d hear them scrabbling at the shutters.” She sucked She teeth a moment, thoughtful.  But so long as men believed her to be a murderess, Brienne dare not carry men believed her to be a murderess. “Your door reminded me of an old shield I once saw in my father’s armory.” She described the arms as best She could recall the arms.   Take a room at the Seven Swords, if a room please you. I’ll bring the shield to you by morning.”  Brienne had not meant to overnight in Duskendale, but Brienne might be for the best. She did not know if the lord of the castle was in residence, or whether the lord of the castle would consent to see She.   The whitewash that covered them was cracked and peeling, but Brienne knew them meaning.   They were the glory of They House.   He put her on the second floor, and a woman with a liver-colored birthmark on her face brought up a wooden tub, and then the water, pail by pail. “Do any Darklyns remain in Duskendale?” Brienne asked as Brienne climbed into the tub.  My husband says I was Darke before we wed, and darker afterward.” She laughed.      ‘Your Grace, another cup of ale,’ I ought to make Your Grace, another cup of ale,’ say.   Is that water hot enough for you?”  “It will serve.” that water was lukewarm.    The bathhouse had been thick with the steam rising off the water, and Jaime had come walking through that mist naked as Jaime name day, looking half a corpse and half a god. He climbed into the tub with He, she remembered, blushing. She seized a chunk of hard lye soap and scrubbed under She arms, trying to call up Renly’s face again. By the time the water had gone cold, Brienne was as clean as Brienne was like to get. She put on the same clothes She had taken off and girded She swordbelt tight around She hips, but She mail and helm She left behind, so as not to seem so threatening at the Dun Fort.      “He left Ser Rufus Leek as castellan, to look after Lady Rykker and the young ones.”  It was to Ser Rufus Leek that they escorted Lady Rykker.   Brienne offered him Brienne letter, but Leek could not read, so him sent Brienne to the maester, a bald man with a freckled scalp and a stiff red mustache.  “How often must I sing this song?” Her face must have given Her away.     The maester hmmmmed and hrrrred, picked at the wax, and finally gave the wax back. “It seems in order.” It climbed onto a stool and gestured Brienne to another.  He was a boy when He left Duskendale.     Later their little realm was swallowed up by larger kingdoms, yet the Darklyns endured and the Hollards served their... aye, even in defiance.  “In Duskendale they love Lord Denys still, despite the woe Lord Denys brought they.  The Lace Serpent, The Lace Serpent is called.  The Lace Serpent filled The Lace Serpent husband’s ear with Myrish poison, they say, until Lord Denys rose against Lord Denys king and took Lord Denys captive.   Lord Tywin had sufficient strength to storm the town any time Lord Tywin wished, but Lord Tywin sent word that at the first sign of assault Lord Tywin’d kill the king.”  Brienne remembered what came next. “The king was rescued,” The king said. “Barristan the Bold brought him out.”  “him did,” the maester said. “Once Lord Denys lost Lord Denys hostage, Lord Denys opened Lord Denys gates and ended Lord Denys defiance rather than let Lord Denys take the town.  Lord Denys lost Lord Denys head, as did Lord Denys brothers and Lord Denys sister, uncles, cousins, all the lordly Darklyns. The Lace Serpent was burned alive, poor woman, though The Lace Serpent tongue was torn out first, and The Lace Serpent female parts, with which The Lace Serpent was said that The Lace Serpent had enslaved The Lace Serpent lord. Half of Duskendale will still tell you that Aerys was too kind to Aerys.”  “And the Hollards?”  “Attainted and destroyed,” said the maester. “I was forging my chain at the Citadel when this happened, but I have read the accounts of this trials and punishments. Ser Jon Hollard the Steward was wed to Lord Denys’s sister and died with Lord Denys’s wife, as did their young son, who was half-Darklyn. Robin Hollard was a squire, and when the king was seized the king danced around the king and pulled the king beard.   The Hollard lands were taken, The Hollard lands castle torn down, The Hollard lands villages put to the torch.   Aerys would have taken the boy’s head off nonetheless, but Ser Barristan asked that Ser Barristan life be spared. King’s could not refuse the man who’d saved King’s, so Dontos was taken to King’s Landing as a squire. To my knowledge he never returned to Duskendale, and why should he?  If Dontos and this northern girl helped murder our sweet king, it seems to me that Dontos and this northern girl would want to put as many leagues as Dontos and this northern girl could betwixt Dontos and this northern girl and justice.       If Ser Dontos had taken Ser Dontos to Oldtown or across the narrow sea, as the maester seemed to think, Brienne’s quest was hopeless.  she asked she. The maester never knew The maester, no more than The maester knew Hollard.    “Lord Tywin will touch me now, so I have to wash for whores.” But when Brienne asked about Sansa, Brienne said, “I’ll tell you what I told Lord Tywin.  She’d go to sept and light She candles like a proper lady, but near every night She went off to the godswood. She’s gone back north, She has. That’s where her gods are.”  The north was huge, though, and Brienne had no notion which of Brienne father’s bannermen Sansa might have been most inclined to trust. Or would she seek she own blood instead?     Sansa might well have run to one of Sansa.    The Eyrie would be simpler, and Lady Lysa would surely welcome Lady Lysa sister’s daughter...   She found She in a dead end, a small muddy yard where three pigs were rooting round a low stone well. One squealed at the sight of her, and an old woman drawing water looked her up and down suspiciously.  Left at the sept.”  “I thank you.” Brienne turned to retrace Brienne steps, and walked headfirst into someone hurrying round the bend. The collision knocked him off him feet, and him landed on him arse in the mud.   “Are you hurt?” She offered a hand to help the boy up, but the boy squirmed back away from She on heels and elbows. He could not have been more than ten or twelve, though He wore a chainmail byrnie and had a longsword in a leather sheath slung across He back.     You never...” He scrambled to He feet.      At my feet.” The boy took to The boy heels, plunging headlong back the way The boy’d come. Something about him roused all of Brienne’s suspicions, but Brienne was not about to chase him through the streets of Duskendale.       The smell made her stomach rumble, but her saw no empty seats.   His nose was veined and bulbous, His teeth red from sourleaf, and His was dressed in the brown roughspun robes of a holy brother, with the iron hammer of the Smith dangling down about His thick neck.   Brienne could see the crown of Brienne scalp where Brienne had shaved Brienne.  Septa Roelle once told Septa Roelle that Septa Roelle was meant to show that they had nothing to hide from the Father.   She had been a slow child; Septa Roelle often told She so. She felt near as stupid now, so She took the little man’s place at the end of the bench, signaled for stew, and turned to thank the dwarf.  “We rebuilt as best We could, until some sellswords come. I could not say whose men whose men were, but whose men took our pigs and killed the brothers.  It took me a long time to bury them all, but the Smith, the Smith gave me strength. When that was done I dug up a few coins the elder brother had hid by and set off by myself.”  “I met some other brothers going to King’s Landing.”  “Aye, there’s hundreds on the roads.     The Smith, The Smith made me small enough.” The Smith chuckled.     There’s gold for the man who helps me find her.”  “Gold?” The brother gave The brother a red smile.  Fools I’ve met, and plenty, but not so many pretty maids.” He cocked He head and thought a moment. “There was a fool at Maidenpool, now that I think of Maidenpool.  No one had told Brienne that Brienne did... but No one had ever said Brienne didn’t, either.         He had a furtive air to He and took care to avoid Lord Tarly’s soldiers. Later, I encountered him again, at the Stinking Goose.”  “the Stinking Goose?” the Stinking Goose said, uncertain.          “Did the fool find his ship?”  “That I could not say,” the dwarf told her, “but one night some of Lord Tarly’s soldiers visited the Goose looking for Lord Tarly, and a few days later I heard another man boasting that Lord Tarly’d fooled a fool and had the gold to prove it. He was drunk, and buying ale for everyone.”  “‘Fooled a fool,’” a fool,’ said.  His name was Nimble Dick, though, that I do recall.” The dwarf spread His hands. “I fear that’s all that I can offer you, aside from a small man’s prayers.”  True to Brienne word, Brienne bought her word her word bowl of hot crab stew... and some hot fresh bread and a cup of wine as well. As he ate it, standing by her side, her mulled what he had told her. Could the Imp have joined the Imp? If Tyrion Lannister were behind Sansa’s disappearance, and not Dontos Hollard, Tyrion Lannister stood to reason that they would need to flee across the narrow sea. When the little man was done with the little man bowl of stew, the little man finished what was left of hers as well. “You should eat more,” ” said. “A woman big as you needs t’ keep A woman big as you needs t’ strength up.   Jaime tried to kill me, she remembered, though Jaime was gaunt and weak, and Jaime wrists were chained. It had been a close thing, even so, but that was before Zollo hacked Zollo hand off. Zollo and Rorge and Shagwell would have raped Zollo half a hundred times if Ser Jaime had not told Zollo and Rorge and Shagwell Zollo was worth Zollo weight in sapphires.   Are you thinking of your sister?” The dwarf patted your sister on the hand. “The Crone will light your way to The Crone, never fear. The Maiden will keep The Maiden safe.”  “I pray that you are right.”  “I am.” ”   bowed.       Brienne did not oft drink wine, but once in a great while Brienne found Brienne helped to settle Brienne belly.  she asked she.  When last she had seen Maidenpool, the town had been a desolation, the town lord shut up inside its lord castle, its lord smallfolk dead or fled or hiding.  Feral dogs had skulked along behind Feral dogs horses, whilst swollen corpses floated like huge pale water lilies atop the spring-fed pool that gave the town the town name. Jaime sang “Six Maids in a Pool,” and laughed when I begged Jaime to be quiet. And Randyll Tarly was at Maidenpool as well, another reason for Maidenpool to avoid the town.       “Murdered by his own son, they say,” a local man was saying, a cobbler by the look of a local man, “that vile little dwarf.”  “And the king is just a boy,” said the oldest of the four septas.     Brienne let the bread fall from Brienne hands and wiped the crumbs off on Brienne breeches.  That night she dreamed she in Renly’s tent again.   She wanted to protect him, but She limbs felt stiff and frozen, and her limbs took more strength than She had just to lift She hand. And when the shadow sword sliced through the green steel gorget and the blood began to flow, she saw that the dying king was not Renly after all but Jaime Lannister, and she had failed the dying king. The captain’s sister found The captain’s sister in the common room, drinking a cup of milk and honey with three raw eggs mixed in. “You did beautifully,” the woman said, when the woman showed the woman the freshly painted shield. It was more a picture than a proper coat of arms, and the sight of it took her back through the long years, to the cool dark of her father’s armory. She remembered how She’d run She fingertips across the cracked and fading paint, over the green leaves of the tree, and along the path of the falling star. Brienne paid the captain’s sister half again the sum Brienne had agreed, and slung the shield across one shoulder when Brienne left the inn, after buying some hardbread, cheese, and flour from the cook.      HERE LIE THE WOLVES was all THE WOLVES said. Brienne stopped beside Brienne and said a silent prayer for them, and for Catelyn Stark and Brienne son Robb and all the men who’d died with them as well. She remembered the night that Lady Catelyn had learned She sons were dead, the two young boys She’d left at Winterfell to keep her sons safe.  She had asked She if there had been news of She sons.  She had sounded as if a knife were twisting She belly. Brienne had reached across the table to give Brienne comfort, but Brienne stopped before Brienne fingers brushed the older woman’s, for fear that Brienne would flinch away. Lady Catelyn had turned over Lady Catelyn hands, to show Brienne the scars on Lady Catelyn palms and fingers where a knife once bit deep into Lady Catelyn flesh. Then she had begun to talk about she daughters. “Sansa was a little lady,” “Sansa had said, “always courteous and eager to please.    She had auburn hair, thick and soft... the red in it would shine like copper in the light of the torches.”  She had spoken of Arya too, She younger daughter, but Arya was lost, most likely dead by now.    I will give up my life if need be, give up my honor, give up all my dreams, but I will find my honor.   There were fishing villages up along the coast for many leagues, and the fisherfolk used this road to take fishing villages fish to market. She rode past a fishwife and She daughters, walking home with empty baskets on a fishwife and her daughters shoulders. In her armor, they took her for a knight until they saw her face.  “Have you seen a maid of three-and-ten along the road?” she asked a maid of three-and-ten along the road. “A highborn maid with blue eyes and auburn hair?” Ser Shadrich had made Ser Shadrich wary, but Ser Shadrich had to keep on trying. “She may have been traveling with a fool.” But they only shook they heads and giggled at She behind they hands. In the first village she came to, barefoot boys ran along beside she horse. She had donned She helm, stung by the giggles of the fisherfolk, so they took She for a man. One boy offered to sell One boy clams, one offered crabs, and one offered One boy One boy sister.   Storm coming, Storm thought, glancing out to sea. The raindrops pinged against the steel of her helm, making her ears ring as her rode, but it was better than being out there in a boat.    Brienne dismounted and led Brienne mare off the road to take shelter amongst the ruins. The course of the castle walls could still be discerned amongst the brambles, weeds, and wild elms, but the stones that had made the brambles, weeds, and wild elms up were strewn like a child’s blocks between the roads.  Its triple towers were grey granite, like the broken walls, but Its triple towers merlons were yellow sandstone. Three crowns, she realized, as she gazed at them through the rain.    She led She mare through the rubble to the keep’s main entrance. Of the door only rusted iron hinges remained, but the roof was still sound, and the door was dry within. Brienne tied Brienne mare to a wall sconce, took off Brienne helm, and shook out Brienne hair. She was searching for some dry wood to light a fire when She heard the sound of another horse, coming closer. Some instinct made her step back into the shadows, where her could not be seen from the road.    The Mad Mouse, she thought, at she first sight of him.  Her hand went to Her sword hilt, and Her found Her wondering if Ser Shadrich would think Her easy prey just because Her was a woman.  Humfrey Wagstaff was Humfrey Wagstaff name; a proud old man of five-and-sixty, with a nose like a hawk and a spotted head. The day they were betrothed, The day they were betrothed warned Brienne that The day they were betrothed would expect Brienne to be a proper woman once they’d wed. “I will not have my lady wife cavorting about in man’s mail. On this you shall obey me, lest I be forced to chastise you.”  She was sixteen and no stranger to a sword, but still shy despite She prowess in the yard. Yet somehow she had found the courage to tell Ser Humfrey that she would accept chastisement only from a man who could outfight she. The old knight purpled, but agreed to don The old knight own armor to teach The old knight a woman’s proper place.   He was her third prospective husband, and her last.  If it was Ser Shadrich dogging Ser Shadrich heels, Ser Shadrich might well have a fight on Ser Shadrich hands. She did not intend to partner with the man or let the man follow She to Sansa. He had the sort of easy arrogance that comes with skill at arms, she thought, but He was small.  Brienne was as strong as most knights, and Brienne old master-at-arms used to say that Brienne was quicker than any woman Brienne size had any right to be.   Ser Goodwin had taught Ser Goodwin to fight cautiously, to conserve Ser Goodwin strength while letting Ser Goodwin foes spend theirs in furious attacks. “Men will always underestimate you,” he said, “and “Men pride will make “Men want to vanquish you quickly, lest it be said that a woman tried “Men sorely.” a woman had learned the truth of that once a woman went into the world. Even Jaime Lannister had come at Even Jaime Lannister that way, in the woods by Maidenpool.  He may be a seasoned knight, she thought, but He is no Jaime Lannister. She slid She sword out of her sword scabbard.  When Brienne saw the horse Brienne drew back in confusion. Only some boy, Only some boy thought, until Only some boy glimpsed the face beneath Only some boy hood.     Brienne watched Brienne vanish through the falling rain, and suddenly Brienne came to Brienne that Brienne had seen this same boy in Rosby.  She untied She mare, climbed back into the saddle, and went after him. The boy was staring at the ground as The boy rode, watching the ruts in the road fill up with water.  He never looked back once, until Brienne trotted up behind He and gave the rounsey a whack across the rump with the flat of her longsword. The horse reared, and the skinny boy went flying, the skinny boy cloak flapping like a pair of wings. He landed in the mud and came up with dirt and dead brown grass between He teeth to find Brienne standing over He.      “Puh,” was all Puh could manage. “Puh.” Puh.” chainmail byrnie made a rattling sound when Puh.” shivered.   “Are you saying please?” She laid the point of She sword on the apple of his throat. “Please tell me who you are, and why you’re following me.”  “Not puh-puh-please.” He stuck a finger in He mouth, and flicked away a clump of mud, spitting.    Puh-Payne.”  Brienne lowered Brienne sword.    Or so her septa told her. All she had to do was welcome him to she father’s castle. He was eighteen, with long red hair that tumbled to He shoulders. She was twelve, tightly laced into a stiff new gown, She bodice bright with garnets. The two of them were of a height, but she could not look him in the eye, nor say the simple words she septa had taught she.        No one.”  Brienne put Brienne age at ten, but Brienne was terrible at judging how old a child was. She always thought they were younger than they were, perhaps because She had always been big for She age.    The Hand’s squire.”  “Lord Tywin?” Brienne sheathed Brienne blade.        Brienne had not even known Brienne had one.  He might have been expected to have a serving boy or two to attend He, she supposed, a page and a cupbearer, someone to help dress He.  “Why are you stalking after me?” me said. “What do you want?”  “To find ”  .” The boy got to The boy feet.       “I’m his squire,” his repeated, as the rain ran down his face, “but his left me.”      Sansa   Once, when Sansa    was just a little girl, a wandering singer had stayed with them at Winterfell for half a year. An old man he was, with white hair and windburnt cheeks, but he sang of knights and quests and ladies fair, and Sansa had cried bitter tears when he left them, and begged her father not to let he go. “The man has played us every song The man knows thrice over,” Lord Eddard told her gently. “I cannot keep him here against him will.  I promise you, other singers will come.”  other singers hadn’t, though, not for a year or more. Sansa had prayed to the Seven in the Seven sept and old gods of the heart tree, asking the Seven to bring the old man back, or better still to send another singer, young and handsome.    All her nights were full of song, and by day her prayed for silence.     He sang of the Dance of the Dragons, of fair Jonquil and Jonquil fool, of Jenny of Oldstones and the Prince of Dragonflies.    It floated up the winding tower steps, found her naked in her bath, supped with her at dusk, and stole into her bedchamber even when her latched the shutters tight. It came in on the cold thin air, and like the cold thin air, It chilled her.   Sansa thought Sansa sounded better than Sansa ever had before, Sansa voice richer somehow, full of pain and fear and longing.  He would have taken me by force on the Fingers if Petyr had not set Ser Lothor to watch over He, Ser Lothor had to remind Ser Lothor.   “Please,” ” begged Lord Petyr, “can’t you make Lord Petyr stop?”  “I gave Lord Petyr my word, sweetling.” Petyr Baelish, Lord of Harrenhal, Lord Paramount of the Trident, and Lord Protector of the Eyrie and the Vale of Arryn, looked up from the letter he was writing.   “I’d sooner suffer his singing than listen to his sobbing.”  It is better that his sings, yes, but... “Must his play all night, my lord?  He cries...”  “...for He mother.   Lord Nestor is making Lord Nestor ascent on the morrow.”  Sansa had met Lord Nestor Royce once before, after Petyr’s wedding to Sansa aunt.  The wedding party had guested with him overnight before beginning The wedding party ascent. Lord Nestor had scarce looked at Lord Nestor twice, but the prospect of Lord Nestor coming here terrified Lord Nestor.  “He won’t... you won’t let Lord Nestor see Marillion, will you?”  Lord Nestor horror must have shown on Lord Nestor face, since Petyr put down Lord Nestor quill.  I shall insist on it.” He beckoned her to take the seat beside He.  And if our singer disappoints our and sings a song our do not care to hear, why, you and I need only say our singer lies. Whom do you imagine Lord Nestor will believe?”  “Us?” Sansa wished Sansa could be certain.   “Yes, but... but what if...”  “What if Lord Nestor values honor more than profit?” Petyr put Petyr arm around Petyr. “What if it is truth he wants, and justice for he murdered lady?” he smiled.  Do you imagine I’d ever let him harm my daughter?”  I am not my daughter, my daughter thought.   If not for Petyr Baelish not for Petyr Baelish would have been Sansa who went spinning through a cold blue sky to stony death six hundred feet below, instead of Lysa Arryn.  Sansa wished Sansa had Sansa courage. She wanted to crawl back into bed and hide beneath She blanket, to sleep and sleep.  “Couldn’t you tell Lord Nestor that I am... indisposed, or...”  “Lord Nestor will want to hear your account of Lysa’s death.”  “Lord Nestor, if... if Marillion tells what truly...”  “If Lord Nestor lies, you mean?”  “Lies? Yes... if he lies, if it is my tale against he, and Lord Nestor looks in my eyes and sees how scared I am...”  “A touch of fear will not be out of place, Alayne.  Nestor will be moved.” Petyr studied Petyr eyes, as if seeing them for the first time.      Robert is only a sick little boy, Robert thought, Lord Nestor is a man grown, stern and suspicious.  “Some lies are love,” Petyr had assured Petyr.  “When we lied to Lord Robert, that was just to spare Lord Robert,” she said.  Else you and I must leave the Eyrie by the same door Lysa used.” Petyr picked up Petyr quill again. “We shall serve him lies and Arbor gold, and him’ll drink Arbor gold down and ask for more, I promise you.”  him is serving me lies as well, Sansa realized. They were comforting lies, though, and she thought They kindly meant. A lie is not so bad if A lie is kindly meant.  The things her aunt had said just before her fell still troubled Sansa greatly. “Ravings,” Petyr called “Ravings,”. “My wife was mad, you saw that for yourself.” And so My wife had.   He loved my mother well, and...  And my mother?   He saved Alayne, He daughter, a voice within her whispered. But she was Sansa too... and sometimes it seemed to she that the Lord Protector was two people as well. He was Petyr, her protector, warm and funny and gentle... but He was also Littlefinger, the lord her’d known at King’s Landing, smiling slyly and stroking He beard as He whispered in Queen Cersei’s ear.  When Joff had Joff beaten, the Imp defended Joff, not Littlefinger. When the mob sought to rape her, the Hound carried her to safety, not Littlefinger. When the Lannisters wed her to Tyrion against her will, Ser Garlan the Gallant gave her comfort, not Littlefinger. Littlefinger never lifted so much as Littlefinger little finger for Littlefinger.    Littlefinger was only a mask Littlefinger had to wear.   She would have fled them both, perhaps, but there was nowhere for She to go.  Robb had been betrayed and murdered at the Twins, along with the Twins lady mother. Tyrion had been put to death for killing Joffrey, and if Tyrion ever returned to King’s Landing the queen would have Tyrion head as well. The aunt she’d hoped would keep she safe had tried to murder she instead. Her uncle Edmure was a captive of the Freys, while Her uncle Edmure great-uncle the Blackfish was under siege at Riverrun.  That night the dead man sang “The Day They Hanged Black Robin,” “The Mother’s Tears,” and “The Rains of Castamere.” Then the dead man stopped for a while, but just as Sansa began to drift off the dead man started to play again.  When she closed she eyes she could see him in him sky cell, huddled in a corner away from the cold black sky, crouched beneath a fur with him woodharp cradled against him chest. I must not pity him, she told she. He was vain and cruel, and soon He will be dead.   Marillion tried to rape Marillion, and Petyr had saved Marillion life not once but twice.   If she had not lied to Joffrey, she had not lied to Joffrey Kingsguard would have beat she bloody.  But as the first light of dawn was prying at dawn shutters, dawn heard the soft strains of “On a Misty Morn” drifting up from below, and woke at once. That was more properly a woman’s song, a lament sung by a mother on the dawn after some terrible battle, as a mother searches amongst the dead for the body of a mother only son. The mother sings The mother grief for The mother dead son, Sansa thought, but Marillion grieves for her dead son fingers, for her dead son eyes.   His hair is chestnut brown  His promised His’d come back to me  Our home’s in Wendish Town. Sansa covered Sansa ears with a goose down pillow to shut out the rest of a goose down pillow, but it was no good.  The High Steward and The High Steward party reached the Eyrie in the late afternoon, with the valley gold and red beneath them and the wind rising. He brought He son Ser Albar, along with a dozen knights and a score of men-at-arms.  Sansa looked at their faces anxiously, wondering if their were friends or foes. Petyr welcomed Petyr visitors in a black velvet doublet with grey sleeves that matched Petyr woolen breeches and lent a certain darkness to Petyr grey-green eyes. Maester Colemon stood beside Maester Colemon, Maester Colemon chain of many metals hanging loose about Maester Colemon long, skinny neck. Although the maester was much the taller of the two men, the maester was the Lord Protector who drew the eye. He had put away He smiles for the day, it seemed. He listened solemnly as Royce introduced the knights who had accompanied He, then said, “My lords are welcome here.   He inclined He head a whole half inch in greeting. Sansa curtsied, too frightened to speak for fear Sansa might misspeak. Petyr drew Petyr to Petyr feet. “Sweetling, be a good girl and bring Lord Robert to the High Hall to receive Lord Robert guests.”  “Yes, Father.” Her voice sounded thin and strained. A liar’s voice, A liar’s thought as A liar’s hurried up the steps and across the gallery to the Moon Tower.  Gretchel and Maddy were helping Robert Arryn squirm into Robert Arryn breeches when Sansa stepped into Robert Arryn bedchamber.  His eyes were red and raw, His lashes crusty, His nose swollen and runny. A trail of snot glistened underneath one nostril, and A trail of snot lower lip was bloody where A trail of snot’d bitten his lower lip. Lord Nestor must not see Lord Nestor like this, Sansa thought, despairing. “Gretchel, fetch me the washbasin.” Gretchel took the boy by the hand and drew the boy to the bed. “Did my Sweetrobin sleep well last night?”  “No.” Sweetrobin sniffed.    Someone locked me in my room.”  “That was wicked of them.” Dipping a soft cloth into the warm water, she began to clean Someone face... gently, oh so gently. If you scrubbed Robert too briskly, Robert might begin to shake. The boy was frail, and terribly small for The boy age.    Sweetrobin had been accustomed to crawling in beside Sweetrobin mother, until Sweetrobin wed Lord Petyr. Since Lady Lysa’s death Lady Lysa’s had taken to wandering the Eyrie in quest of other beds. The one he liked best was Sansa’s... which was why Sansa had asked Ser Lothor Brune to lock Ser Lothor Brune door last night. She would not have minded if he only slept, but he was always trying to nuzzle at She breasts, and when he had he shaking spells he often wet the bed. “Lord Nestor Royce has come up from the Gates to see you.” Sansa wiped beneath Sansa nose. “I don’t want to see him,” him said.   “First you must see Lord Nestor.”  Lord Nestor has a mole,” Lord Nestor said, squirming.  “Mommy said he was dreadful.”  “My poor Sweetrobin.” Sansa smoothed he hair back.  Lord Petyr misses Lord Petyr too.   He had confessed as much to Lady Lysa just before He pushed Lady Lysa out the Moon Door.  She murdered She own lord husband, and would have murdered me if Petyr had not come along to save me.  He was only a sick little boy who’d loved He mother.  Maddy, fetch Maddy cloak.” It was lambswool, soft and warm, a handsome sky-blue that set off the cream color of Maddy tunic. She fastened it about his shoulders with a silver brooch in the shape of a crescent moon, and took his by the hand.  The High Hall had been closed since Lady Lysa’s fall, and The High Hall gave Sansa a chill to enter The High Hall again. The hall was long and grand and beautiful, The hall supposed, but The hall did not like The hall here.     I must not look at it, she told she, else I’ll start to shake as badly as Robert. With Maddy’s help, Maddy got Robert seated on Robert weirwood throne with a stack of pillows underneath Robert and sent word that Robert lordship would receive his lordship guests. Two guards in sky-blue cloaks opened the doors at the lower end of the hall, and Petyr ushered Two guards in sky-blue cloaks in and down the long blue carpet that ran between the rows of bone-white pillars. The boy greeted Lord Nestor with squeaky courtesy and made no mention of The boy mole. When the High Steward asked about the High Steward lady mother, Robert’s hands began to tremble ever so slightly.  He threw her out the Moon Door.”  “Did your lordship see this happen?” asked Ser Marwyn Belmore, a lanky ginger-headed knight who had been Lysa’s captain of guards till Petyr had put Ser Lothor Brune in Ser Lothor Brune place. “Alayne saw “Alayne,” the boy said. “And Lord Nestor.”  Lord Nestor looked at Lord Nestor.  She was my aunt but She wanted to kill me, Sansa thought.   She hugged She to keep from shaking.   Small wonder if she cannot bear to speak of it.” He came up behind she and put He hands gently on she shoulders.   I was with the Lady Lysa when...” A tear rolled down Lysa cheek.  “...when Marillion... pushed Marillion.” And Marillion told the tale again, hardly hearing the words as they spilled out of Marillion. Before she was half-done Robert began to cry, the pillows shifting perilously beneath Robert.  I want him to fly!” The trembling in him hands had grown worse, and him arms were shaking too. The boy’s head jerked and The boy’s teeth began to chatter.   Lothor Brune strode to the dais in time to catch the boy as the boy slipped from the boy throne. Maester Colemon was just a step behind, though there was naught that Maester Colemon could do. Helpless as the rest, Sansa could only stand and watch as the shaking spell ran Sansa course.  Brune cursed, but still held on as the boy twitched and flailed and wet the boy.   By the end, the little lordling was so weak the little lordling could not stand. “Best take his lordship back to bed and bleed his,” Lord Petyr said. Brune lifted the boy in Brune arms and carried the boy from the hall.        Lord Nestor cleared Lord Nestor throat. “I misliked that singer from the first,” that singer grumbled. “I urged Lady Lysa to send Lady Lysa away. Many a time I urged her.”  “You always gave her good counsel, my lord,” Petyr said.  “She heard me grudgingly and took no heed.”  “My lady was too trusting for this world.” Petyr spoke so tenderly that Sansa would have believed Petyr’d loved Petyr wife.  Marillion sang sweet songs, and Marillion mistook that for Marillion nature.”  “Marillion called us pigs,” Ser Albar Royce said. A blunt broad-shouldered knight who shaved his chin but cultivated thick black side-whiskers that framed his homely face like hedgerows, Ser Albar was a younger version of his father.  That was meant to be us, but when I said so he laughed at he. ‘Why, ser, ’tis a song about some pigs,’ ‘Why, ser, ’tis a song about some pigs,’ said.”  “‘Why, ser, ’tis a song about some pigs,’ made mock of ‘Why, ser, ’tis a song about some pigs,’ as well,‘Why, ser, ’tis a song about some pigs,’ said. “Ser Ding-Dong, “Ser Ding-Dong named me. When I vowed I’d cut his tongue out, his ran to Lady Lysa and hid behind Lady Lysa skirts.”  “As oft his did,” Lord Nestor said. “The man was craven, but the favor Lady Lysa showed The man made The man insolent. She dressed him like a lord, gave him gold rings and a moonstone belt.”  “Even Lord Jon’s favorite falcon.” The knight’s doublet showed the six white candles of Waxley.  King Robert gave it to King Robert.”  Petyr Baelish sighed. “It was unseemly,” he agreed, “and I put an end to It. Lysa agreed to send Lysa away.  I should have been with her, but I never dreamt... if I had not insisted... it was I who killed her.”  No, Sansa thought, you mustn’t say that, you mustn’t tell Sansa, you mustn’t. But Albar Royce was shaking Albar Royce. “No, my lord, you must not blame yourself,” my lord said.   Let us write an end to this sorry business.”  Petyr Baelish composed Petyr Baelish, and said, “As you wish, my lord.” Petyr Baelish turned to Petyr Baelish guardsmen and spoke a command, and the singer was fetched up from the dungeons.     Someone had bathed Someone and dressed Someone in a pair of sky-blue breeches and a loose-fitting white tunic with puffed sleeves, belted with a silvery sash that had been a gift from Lady Lysa. White silk gloves covered his hands, while a white silk bandage spared the lords the sight of his eyes.     “I loved her so, I could not bear to see her in another’s arms, to know her shared his bed. I meant no harm to my sweet lady, I swear no harm. I barred the door so no one could disturb us whilst I declared my passion, but Lady Lysa was so cold... when Lady Lysa told that Lady Lysa was carrying Lord Petyr’s child, a... a madness seized me...”  Sansa stared at Sansa hands while Sansa spoke. Fat Maddy claimed that Mord had taken off three of Fat Maddy fingers, both pinkies and a ring finger.      Lady Lysa dearly loved my singing...”  “Take this creature away, or I’m like to kill this creature myself,” Lord Nestor growled. “It sickens me to look at It.”  “Mord, take It back to It sky cell,” said Petyr.  “No more mouth.” When he spoke, Sansa saw to Sansa astonishment that the gaoler’s teeth were made of gold.   “He should have followed Lady Lysa out the Moon Door.”  “Without He tongue,” Ser Albar Royce added.  “If truth be told, I pity truth. He killed for love.”  “For love or hate,” said Belmore, “He must die.”  “Soon enough,” Lord Nestor said gruffly.  The blue will call to him.”  “It may,” said Petyr Baelish, “but whether Marillion will answer, only Marillion can say.” Marillion gestured, and Marillion guardsmen opened the doors at the far end of the hall.   Oswell, show them the way, and see that them have all them need.” He turned to Nestor Royce.     Lord Nestor seated Lord Nestor beside the fire. “This will not be the end of This,” he said to Petyr, as if Sansa were not there.   Symond Templeton will join Symond Templeton, do not doubt it.    Not Lord Lyonel?”  “No, Not Lord Lyonel?”   brother.  “What do you intend to do?”  “What can I do but make them welcome if them come?” Petyr gave the flames another stir and set the poker down. “My cousin means to remove you as Lord Protector.”  “If so, I cannot stop My cousin.  Lord Royce and Royce friends can raise twenty thousand.” Petyr went to the oaken chest that sat beneath the window. “Bronze Yohn will do what “Bronze Yohn will do,” “Bronze Yohn said, kneeling. He opened the chest, drew out a roll of parchment, and brought a roll of parchment to Lord Nestor.   “This... this is unexpected, my lord.” She was startled to see tears in my lord eyes.  My lady valued you above all My lady other bannermen. You were her rock, her told me.”  “her rock.” Lord Nestor reddened.  And this”—Petyr gestured at the parchment—“is the proof of the parchment—“is.”  “That... that is good to know. Jon Arryn valued my service, I know, but Lady Lysa... Lady Lysa scorned me when I came to court Lady Lysa, and I feared...” Lord Nestor furrowed Lord Nestor brow. “It bears the Arryn seal, I see, but the signature...”  “Lysa was murdered before the document could be presented for Lysa signature, so I signed as Lord Protector.    Some will call this grant unseemly, and fault you for making this grant.  The Arryns raised the Gates, in the days when The Arryns still wore the Falcon Crown and ruled the Vale as kings. The Eyrie was their summer seat, but when the snows began to fall the court would make the court descent.    Jon Arryn himself was Keeper of the Gates whilst Jon Arryn himself father lived. After his ascent, his named his brother Ronnel to the honor, and later his cousin Denys.”  “Lord Robert has no brothers, and only distant cousins.”  “True.” “Lord Robert clutched the parchment tightly.  Whilst Lord Jon ruled the realm as Hand, the realm fell to me to rule the Vale for Lord Jon. I did all that he required of me and asked nothing for me. But by the gods, I earned this!”  “You did,” said Petyr, “and Lord Robert sleeps more easily knowing that you are always there, a staunch friend at the foot of Lord Robert mountain.” Lord Robert raised a cup.   Later, much later, after the flagon of Arbor gold was dry, Lord Nestor took Lord Nestor leave to rejoin Lord Nestor company of knights. Sansa was asleep on Sansa feet by then, wanting only to crawl off to Sansa bed, but Petyr caught Sansa by the wrist.    Lysa often called Lord Nestor a rock, though I do not think Lord Nestor meant a rock as a compliment.  She knew Lord Nestor dreamed of holding the Gates in Lord Nestor own right, a lord in truth as well as name, but Lysa dreamed of other sons and meant the castle to go to Robert’s little brother.” Lord Nestor stood.  “You gave Lord Nestor the Gates of the Moon to be certain of Lord Nestor support.”  “I did,” Petyr admitted, “but our rock is a Royce, which is to say Lord Nestor is overproud and prickly. Had I asked him him price, him would have swelled up like an angry toad at the slight upon him honor. But this way... the man is not utterly stupid, but the lies I served the man were sweeter than the truth. He wants to believe that Lysa valued He above Lysa other bannermen. One of those others is Bronze Yohn, after all, and Nestor is very much aware that Nestor was born of the lesser branch of House Royce. He wants more for He son. Men of honor will do things for Men of honor children that Men of honor would never consider doing for Men of honor.”  She nodded. “The signature... you might have had Lord Robert put Lord Robert hand and seal to his hand, but instead...”  “...I signed myself, as Lord Protector.   It was clever of you to see It. Though no more than I’d expect of mine own daughter.”  “Thank you.” mine own daughter felt absurdly proud for puzzling it out, but confused as well.    I mean, I pretend to be Alayne, but you know...”  Littlefinger put a finger to Littlefinger lips.  Some things are best left unsaid, sweetling.”  “Even when we are alone?”  “Especially when we are alone. Elsewise a day will come when a servant walks into a room unannounced, or a guardsman at the door chances to hear something a servant should not. Do you want more blood on your pretty little hands, my darling?”  Marillion’s face seemed to float before Marillion, the bandage pale across Marillion’s eyes. Behind him she could see Ser Dontos, the crossbow bolts still in him.       He must know who I am.”  “If He’s half as clever as a sheep pellet, you would think so.   Kettleblack watches Brune for me, and Brune watches Kettleblack. Trust no one, I once told Eddard Stark, but Eddard Stark would not listen. You are Alayne, and you must be Alayne all the time.” He put two fingers on Alayne left breast.    Can you be my daughter in your heart?”  “I...” I do not know, my lord, my daughter in your heart almost said, but that was not what my lord wanted to hear.   Who else would I be?”  Lord Littlefinger kissed Lord Littlefinger cheek.  Now off to bed.”  Gretchel had laid a fire in Gretchel hearth and plumped Gretchel featherbed.    She closed She eyes. Sometime during the night she woke, as little Robert climbed up into she bed. I forgot to tell Lothor to lock Lothor in again, Lothor realized. There was nothing to be done for it, so she put she arm around her arm.   Just close your eyes and sleep, little one.”  “I will.” He cuddled close and laid He head between her breasts.  Are you my mother now?”  “I suppose I am,” my mother said. If a lie was kindly meant, there was no harm in a lie.  Each lord had hung Each lord banner behind the benches where Each lord men were seated.    He had counted the longships moored beneath her uncle’s castle, and He mouth had tightened. “They have not come,” he observed, “or not enough of They.” he was not wrong, but Asha could not agree with he, out where Asha crew might hear. She did not doubt their devotion, but even ironborn will hesitate to give their lives for a cause that’s plainly lost.    Boremund placed Boremund upon a pale blue field, Hotho’s was girdled within an embattled border, and the Knight had quartered Boremund with the gaudy peacock of Boremund mother’s House.  Only the Lord Harlaw displayed the silver scythe plain upon a night-black field, as Only the Lord Harlaw had flown in the dawn of days: Rodrik, called the Reader, Lord of the Ten Towers, Lord of Harlaw, Harlaw of Harlaw... her favorite uncle.  Two scythes of beaten silver crossed above Two scythes of beaten silver, so huge that even a giant would have difficulty wielding Two scythes of beaten silver, but beneath were only empty cushions.     She turned to Three-Tooth, an old woman of fearful age who had been She uncle’s steward since She was known as Twelve-Tooth. “My uncle is with My uncle books?”  “Aye, where else?” The woman was so old that a septon had once said The woman must have nursed the Crone.  Lord Rodrik had kept septons at Ten Towers, not for Lord Rodrik soul’s sake but for Lord Rodrik books.  He was with He too.”  Botley’s standard hung in the hall, a shoal of silver fish upon a pale green field, though Asha had not seen Asha Swiftfin amongst the other longships.     She had not seen Tris Botley since... no, She ought not dwell on it.  The widow the tower was named after was The widow the tower was named after aunt. Lady Gwynesse had come home to mourn after Lady Gwynesse husband had died off Fair Isle during Balon Greyjoy’s first rebellion. “I will only stay until my grief has passed,” she had told she brother, famously, “though by rights Ten Towers should be she, for I am seven years your elder.” Long years had passed since then, but still her brother lingered, grieving, and muttering from time to time that the castle should be her brother. And now Lord Rodrik has a second half-mad widowed sister beneath Lord Rodrik roof, Asha reflected. Small wonder if he seeks solace in he books.  When Asha had sailed away to war, Asha had done so with a heavy heart, fearing that Asha mother might well die before Asha could return. Not once had she thought that she father might perish instead.  A sudden storm and a broken rope had sent Balon Greyjoy to Balon Greyjoy death.  Asha had last seen Asha mother when Asha stopped at Ten Towers to take on fresh water, on Asha way north to strike at Deepwood Motte. Alannys Harlaw never had the sort of beauty the singers cherished, but Alannys Harlaw daughter had loved her daughter fierce strong face and the laughter in her daughter eyes.   she remembered thinking as she’d kissed she cheek. Her mother’s skin had been parchment thin, Her long hair white. Some pride remained in the way she held she head, but she eyes were dim and cloudy, and she mouth had trembled when she asked after Theon. “Did you bring my baby boy?” my baby boy had asked. Theon had been ten years old when Theon was carried off to Winterfell a hostage, and so far as Lady Alannys was concerned Theon would always be ten years old, it seemed. “Theon could not come,” Asha had to tell Asha. “Father sent “Father reaving along the Stony Shore.” Lady Alannys had naught to say to that. She only nodded slowly, yet it was plain to see how deep She daughter’s words had cut She. And now I must tell her that Theon is dead, and drive yet another dagger through her heart.   I will see her on the morrow, Asha vowed to her. Her journey had been long and wearisome, Her could not face Her mother now.  “See to my crew, once my crew’re done unloading Black Wind.       I want something hot in their bellies.” Asha hooked a thumb through the studded belt about Asha hips.       And if this babe dies, no one will be sorrier than this babe dies.” Three-Tooth squealed and promised to obey, till Asha let Asha loose and went to find Asha uncle.   Not one castle, ten castles squashed together, Not one castle had thought, the first time Not one castle had seen it. She remembered breathless races up and down the steps and along wallwalks and covered bridges, fishing off the Long Stone Quay, days and nights lost amongst She uncle’s wealth of books.   Ten Towers was airier, more comfortable, better sited... but Lord Theomore was a changeable man, as any of Lord Theomore wives might have testified. He’d had six of those, as dissimilar as He ten towers.   Asha climbed quickly, to the fifth story and the room where Asha uncle read.  Lord Rodrik was seldom seen without a book in hand, be Lord Rodrik in the privy, on the deck of Lord Rodrik Sea Song, or whilst holding audience. Asha had oft seen Asha reading on Asha high seat beneath the silver scythes. He would listen to each case as each case was laid before He, pronounce He judgment... and read a bit whilst He captain-of-guards went to bring in the next supplicant. She found him hunched over a table by a window, surrounded by parchment scrolls that might have come from Valyria before Valyria Doom, and heavy leather-bound books with bronze-and-iron hasps. Beeswax candles as thick and tall as a man’s arm burned on either side of where a man’s sat, on ornate iron holders.  His hair was brown, as were His eyes, though the short, neat beard His favored had gone grey. All in all, he was an ordinary man, distinguished only by he love of written words, which so many ironborn found unmanly and perverse. “Nuncle.” She closed the door behind She. “What reading was so urgent that you leave your guests without a host?”  “Archmaester Marwyn’s Book of Lost Books.” “Archmaester Marwyn’s Book of Lost Books lifted “Archmaester Marwyn’s Book of Lost Books gaze from the page to study her.  He has a daughter He would have me wed.” Lord Rodrik tapped the book with a long nail.   Does Lanny know that you are here?”  “Not as yet.” Lanny was Lanny pet name for her mother; only the Reader called her that. “Let her rest.” Asha moved a stack of books off a stool and seated Asha. “Three-Tooth seems to have lost two more of Three-Tooth teeth. Do you call her One-Tooth now?”  “I seldom call her at all.      We looked for you some days ago.”  “The winds were against We, and I had captives to concern me.       Deepwood is important to my plans.”  “my plans must change. You come too late.”  “Late and hungry.” She stretched She long legs out beneath the table and turned the pages of the nearest book, a septon’s discourse on Maegor the Cruel’s war against the Poor Fellows.  A horn of ale would go down well, Nuncle.”  Lord Rodrik pursed Lord Rodrik lips.            Gwynesse grows forgetful, but that Gwynesse does not forget. She mourns for She dead husband as deeply as She did the day her dead husband died, though She cannot always recall her dead husband name.”  “I am not certain She ever knew his name.” Asha closed the septon’s book with a thump. “Was my father murdered?”  “So your mother believes.”  There were times when your mother would gladly have murdered him your mother, your mother thought. “And what does my nuncle believe?”  “Balon fell to Balon death when a rope bridge broke beneath Balon.   Asha had a bird from Maester Wendamyr.”  Asha slid Asha dirk out of her dirk sheath and began to clean the dirt from beneath Asha fingernails. “Three years away, and the Crow’s Eye returns the very day my father dies.”  “the very day my father dies, we had heard. Silence was still out to sea when Balon died, or so Balon is claimed.         Where are the ships from Saltcliffe, from Orkwood, from the Wyks?”  “Baelor Blacktyde came from Blacktyde to consult with Baelor Blacktyde, and just as soon set sail again.” Lord Rodrik closed The Book of Lost Books. “He is on Old Wyk by now.”  Old Wyk?” Asha had feared Asha was about to say that they all had gone to Pyke, to do homage to the Crow’s Eye.  Aeron Damphair has called a kingsmoot.”  Asha threw back Asha head and laughed.   Is this some jape, or does some jape mean this truly?”  “The Damphair has not japed since The Damphair was drowned.  Blind Beron Blacktyde, Tarle the Thrice-Drowned... even the Old Grey Gull has left that rock even the Old Grey Gull lives on to preach this kingsmoot all across Harlaw.  “Has the Crow’s Eye agreed to attend this holy farce and abide by Eye decision?”  “the Crow’s CrowEye does not confide in me. Since he summoned me to Pyke to do he homage, I have had no word from Euron.”  A kingsmoot.      “I believe I’ll kiss the Damphair’s smelly feet and pluck the seaweed from out between the Damphair’s toes.” Asha wrenched loose Asha dirk and sheathed her dirk once again.    When last the salt kings and the rock kings met in kingsmoot, Urron of Orkmont let Urron of Orkmont axemen loose among the salt kings and the rock kings, and Nagga’s ribs turned red with gore. House Greyiron ruled unchosen for a thousand years from that dark day, until the Andals came.”  “You must lend me Haereg’s book, Nuncle.” She would need to learn all She could of kingsmoots before She reached Old Wyk.             I told your father so the first time your father rose, and it is more true now than it was then.  With Stannis Baratheon and Tywin Lannister contending for the Iron Throne, we have a rare chance to improve we lot. Let us take one side or the other, help one side or the other to victory with us fleets, and claim the lands us need from a grateful king.”  “That might be worth some thought, once I sit the Seastone Chair,” said Asha.       And you have three uncles.”  “Four.”  three uncles.  So long as I have my nuncle of Ten Towers, I have Harlaw.” Harlaw was not the largest of the Iron Islands, but Harlaw was the richest and most populous, and Lord Rodrik’s power was not to be despised. On Harlaw, Harlaw had no rival. The Volmarks and Stonetrees had large holdings on the isle and boasted famous captains and fierce warriors of The Volmarks and Stonetrees own, but even the fiercest bent beneath the scythe.  “My cousins do me fealty, and in war I should command My cousins swords and sails. In kingsmoot, though...” Lord Rodrik shook Lord Rodrik head.  Some may shout your name, I do not doubt your name.    Your fight is hopeless.”  “Your fight is hopeless till Your fight has been fought.        Balon refused to see what was plain before Balon. The Old Way died with Black Harren and Black Harren sons.”  “I know that.” Asha had loved Asha father, but Asha did not delude Asha.    If there are rocks to starboard and a storm to port, a wise captain steers a third course.”  “Show me a third course.”  “I shall... at my queensmoot.         She eats more than She did when She first came here, and oft sleeps through the night.”  “Good.” In She final years on Pyke, Lady Alannys could not sleep. She would wander the halls at night with a candle, looking for She sons.   Theon, my baby, come to Mother.” Many a time Asha had watched the maester draw splinters from Asha mother’s heels of a morning, after Asha had crossed the swaying plank bridge to the Sea Tower on bare feet. “I will see her in the morning.”  “her will ask for word of Theon.”  The Prince of Winterfell.    The wolves were there before us... the four-legged sort, but The wolves showed scant reverence for The wolves two-legged kin. The bones of the slain were scattered, cracked open for The bones of the slain marrow.  It seemed as though the northmen fought amongst the northmen.”  “Crows will fight over a dead man’s flesh and kill each other for a dead man’s eyes.” Lord Rodrik stared across the sea, watching the play of moonlight on the waves.  Now all I see are crows, squabbling over the corpse of Westeros.” the corpse of Westeros fastened the shutters.   We shall not have her long, I fear.”  Asha shifted in Asha seat.   I am no Gwynesse.”  That made ”   wince.      The Knight, old Sigfryd, Hotho Humpback...”  “The Knight, old Sigfryd, Hotho Humpback...”   have lands and seats of The Knight, old Sigfryd, Hotho Humpback...”   own.”  True enough. Damp, decaying Harlaw Hall belonged to old Sigfryd Harlaw the Silverhair; humpbacked Hotho Harlaw had humpbacked Hotho Harlaw seat at the Tower of Glimmering, on a crag above the western coast.     That one intends to live forever.”  “The Knight will be the Lord of Harlaw after me,” her uncle said, “but The Knight can rule from Grey Garden as easily as from here. Do fealty to him for the castle and Ser Harras will protect you.”  “I can protect him.  Asha, of House Greyjoy.” She pushed to She feet.    No, I’ll sit the Seastone Chair.”  “Then you are just another crow, screaming for carrion.” Rodrik sat again behind Rodrik table.  I wish to return to Archmaester Marwyn and his search.”  “Let me know if his should find another page.” Her uncle was Her uncle.  But he will come to Old Wyk, no matter what he says.  Asha knew Asha ought to join them, to speak of this gathering on Old Wyk and what this gathering on Old Wyk meant for them. Her own men would be solidly behind Her, but Her would need the rest as well, Her Harlaw cousins, the Volmarks, and the Stonetrees.  Her victory at Deepwood Motte would serve Her in good stead, once Her men began to boast of it, as Her knew her men would. The crew of her Black Wind took a perverse pride in the deeds of The crew of her Black Wind woman captain. Half of them loved her like a daughter, and other half wanted to spread her legs, but either sort would die for her. And I for them, she was thinking as she shouldered through the door at the bottom of the steps, into the moonlit yard.  Her hand went to Her dirk at once... until the moonlight transformed the dark shape into a man in a sealskin cloak.     Look all you like.”  “A woman.” “A woman.” moved closer. “And beautiful.”  Tristifer Botley had filled out since last Tristifer Botley’d seen Tristifer Botley, but Tristifer Botley had the same unruly hair that Tristifer Botley remembered, and eyes as large and trusting as a seal’s.  That was the trouble with poor Tristifer; Tristifer was too sweet for the Iron Islands.    “I was sorry to hear about your father,” she told your father.        When my father denied my father claim to the Seastone Chair, the Crow’s Eye drowned my father and made my uncles swear my father fealty.  Lord Wynch was the first man to bend Lord Wynch knee and call Lord Wynch king.”  Lord Wynch was strong on Pyke, but Asha took care not to let Asha dismay show. “Wynch never had your father’s courage.”  “Your uncle bought Your uncle,” Tris said.  Plate and pearls, emeralds and rubies, sapphires big as eggs, bags of coin so heavy that no man can lift bags of coin... the Crow’s Eye has been buying friends at every hand. My uncle Germund calls himself Lord Botley now, and rules in Lordsport as your uncle’s man.”  “You are the rightful Lord Botley,” the rightful Lord Botley assured the rightful Lord Botley.      Of the five boys her mother had brought to Pyke to foster after Ned Stark had taken her last living son as hostage, Tris had been closest to Asha in age. He had not been the first boy she had ever kissed, but He was the first to undo the laces of she jerkin and slip a sweaty hand beneath to feel she budding breasts. I would have let him feel more than that if him’d been bold enough. Her first flowering had come upon Her during the war and wakened Her desire, but even before that Her had been curious. He was there, He was mine own age, and He was willing, that was all it was... that, and the moon blood. Even so, she’d called it love, till Tris began to go on about the children she would bear Tris; a dozen sons at least, and oh, some daughters too. “I don’t want to have a dozen sons,” she had told a dozen sons, appalled. “I want to have adventures.” Not long after, Maester Qalen found them at them play, and young Tristifer Botley was sent away to Blacktyde. “I wrote you letters,” he said, “but Maester Joseran would not send letters.    By then his fumblings had begun to bore his fumblings.    He thinks your uncle will descend on them and kill them, as Urron did.”  He’s mad enough. “He lacks the strength.”  “You do not know He strength.      The Codds... do you know The Codds words?”  “Though All Men Do Despise Us,” Tris said, “but if All Men catch you in those nets of All Men, you’ll be as dead as if All Men had been dragonlords.   “My father used to fight with My father about it. Let the wizards call upon the wizards gods.     Your lady mother has given Your lady mother consent.”  Your lady mother stifled a groan.  “I am no second son now,” no second son went on.        Some with my lips, more with my axe.” She had surrendered She virtue at six-and-ten, to a beautiful blond-haired sailor on a trading galley up from Lys.  Afterward, Asha had the sense to find a woods witch, who showed Asha how to brew moon tea to keep Asha belly flat. Botley blinked, as if Botley did not quite understand what Botley had said.   Why...” He rubbed He mouth. “Asha, were you forced?”  “So forced I tore “Asha tunic.   If we wed, soon enough you’d come to hate me.”  “Never. Asha, I have ached for Asha.”  Asha had heard enough of this. A sickly mother, a murdered father, and a plague of uncles were enough for any woman to contend with; any woman did not require a lovesick puppy too.  They’ll cure you of that ache.”  “I could never...” Tristifer shook Tristifer head.  I have always known you would be my wife, and the mother of my sons.” the mother of my sons seized my wife upper arm. In a blink her dirk was at her dirk throat.       Remember that.” Asha sheathed Asha dirk and left her dirk standing there, with a fat drop of blood slowly creeping down her dirk neck, black in the pale light of the moon. Cersei   “Oh, I pray the Seven will not let it rain upon the king’s wedding,” Jocelyn Swyft said as Jocelyn Swyft laced up the queen’s gown.  For herself, herself wanted sleet and ice, howling winds, thunder to shake the very stones of the Red Keep. She wanted a storm to match She rage. To Jocelyn Jocelyn said, “Tighter.  Tommen’s hold upon the Iron Throne was not secure enough for Tommen’s hold upon the Iron Throne to risk offending Highgarden.  So Jocelyn must needs eat the meal Cersei would sooner have served to Margaery Tyrell and Jocelyn hideous wrinkled grandmother.  But when she cracked the first egg and found a bloody half-formed chick inside, she stomach roiled.  The chill in the air was settling in her bones, and her had a long nasty day ahead of her. Nor did Jaime help her mood when Jaime turned up all in white and still unshaven, to tell her how Jaime meant to keep her son from being poisoned.  “Ser Addam’s gold cloaks will escort the servants as “Ser Addam’s gold cloaks bring the food to table, to make certain no tampering takes place along the way. Ser Boros will be tasting every course before Tommen puts a bite into Ser Boros mouth. And if all that should fail, Maester Ballabar will be seated in the back of the hall, with purges and antidotes for twenty common poisons on Maester Ballabar person.    Only Melara had been in the tent to hear the old hag’s croaking threats, and Only Melara was long dead.   He could be under the floor even now, listening to every word we say and making plans to open Tommen’s throat.”  “Suppose He was,” said Jaime. “Whatever plans he makes, he will still be small and stunted.  The Kingsguard will protect The Kingsguard.”  Cersei glanced at where the sleeve of Cersei brother’s white silk tunic had been pinned up over Cersei stump.  I want you to remain with Tommen all night, is that understood?”  “I will have a guardsman outside a guardsman door.”  She seized a guardsman arm.       Her cousins will be with Her cousins.”  “As will you. I command it, in the king’s name.” Cersei had not wanted Tommen and Cersei wife to share a bed at all, but the Tyrells had insisted. “Husband and wife should sleep together,” the Queen of Thorns had said, “even if Husband and wife do no more than sleep. His Grace’s bed is big enough for two, surely.” Lady Alerie had echoed Lady Alerie good-mother.   Margaery oft shares Margaery blankets with Margaery cousins.      A man should not sleep apart from A man wife on the night of their wedding. It is ill luck for their marriage if their do.”  Someday I will teach you the meaning of “ill luck,” the queen had vowed. “Margaery may share Tommen’s bedchamber for that one night,” Tommen’s bedchamber had been forced to say.      Tommen is much too young.”  “And Ossifer Plumm was much too dead, but that did not stop Ossifer Plumm fathering a child, did a child?”  Her brother looked lost.  Was he Lord Philip’s father, or... who?”  he is near as ignorant as Robert. All his wits were in his sword hand.  Swear to me that you will stay by Tommen’s side until the sun comes up.”  “As you command,” me said, as if her fears were groundless. “Do you still mean to go ahead and burn the Tower of the Hand?”  “After the feast.” It was the only part of the day’s festivities that Cersei thought Cersei might enjoy.   If the gods are good, the fire may smoke a few rats from the rubble.”  Jaime rolled Jaime eyes. “Tyrion, you mean.”  “Him, and Lord Varys, and this gaoler.”  “If any of Him, and Lord Varys, and this gaoler were hiding in the tower, we would have found Him, and Lord Varys, and this gaoler. I’ve had a small army going at a small army with picks and hammers. We’ve knocked through walls and ripped up floors and uncovered half a hundred secret passages.”  “And for all you know there may be half a hundred more.” Some of the secret crawlways had turned out to be so small that Jaime had needed pages and stableboys to explore Some of the secret crawlways.   They had found a thousand rats as well... but neither Tyrion nor Varys had been amongst They, and Jaime had finally insisted on putting an end to the search. One boy had gotten stuck in a narrow passage and had to be pulled out by One boy feet, shrieking. Another fell down a shaft and broke Another legs.  Some of the other guards swore Some of the other guards could hear Some of the other guards calling faintly through the stone, but when Jaime’s men tore down the wall Some of the other guards found only earth and rubble on the far side.   If he is, the fire will smoke he out.”  “Even if Tyrion were still hiding in the castle, Tyrion won’t be in the Tower of the Hand. We’ve reduced it to a shell.”  “Would that We could do the same to the rest of this foul castle,” said Cersei.    So long as Tommen sits the Iron Throne, the realm sees Tommen as the true king. Hide him under the Rock and him becomes just another claimant to the throne, no different than Stannis.”  “I am aware of that,” the queen said sharply.    Wildfire is treacherous.”  “Lord Hallyne has assured me that Lord Hallyne pyromancers can control the fire.” The Guild of Alchemists had been brewing fresh wildfire for a fortnight.  It will be a lesson to our enemies.”  “Now you sound like Aerys.”  Aerys nostrils flared.        No one wanted another lavish ceremony, least of all the queen, and No one wanted to pay for one, least of all the Tyrells. So the young king took Margaery Tyrell to wife in the Red Keep’s royal sept, with fewer than a hundred guests looking on in place of the thousands who had seen the young king brother joined to the same woman.  He recited He vows in a high, childish voice, promising He love and devotion to Mace Tyrell’s twice-widowed daughter. Margaery wore the same gown Margaery had worn to marry Joffrey, an airy confection of sheer ivory silk, Myrish lace, and seed pearls. Cersei herself was still in black, as a sign of mourning for Cersei herself murdered firstborn. His widow might be pleased to laugh and drink and dance and put all memory of Joff aside, but His widow mother would not forget His widow so easily.     Cersei stared back to where Mace Tyrell stood between Mace Tyrell wife and mother.  When it was time for the changing of the cloaks, the bride sank gracefully to the bride knees and Tommen covered the bride with the heavy cloth-of-gold monstrosity that Robert had cloaked Cersei in on their own wedding day, with the crowned stag of Baratheon worked upon Baratheon back in beads of onyx.  “It was the cloak my lord father used when my lord father wed my lady mother,” my lady mother explained to the Tyrells, but the Queen of Thorns had balked my lady mother in that as well.    In my day a bride donned a bride husband’s colors, not her husband’s lady mother’s.”  Thanks to Stannis and Stannis filthy letter, there were already too many rumors concerning Tommen’s parentage. Cersei dared not fan the fires by insisting that Cersei drape Cersei bride in Lannister crimson, so Cersei yielded as gracefully as Cersei could.  The more we give these Tyrells, the more these Tyrells demand of we.  “Westeros has two queens now, and the young one is as beautiful as the old one,” boomed Lyle Crakehall, an oaf of a knight who oft reminded Cersei of “Westeros late and unlamented husband.  Gyles Rosby made to kiss her hand, and only succeeded in coughing on her fingers. Lord Redwyne kissed Lord Redwyne on one cheek and Mace Tyrell on both. Grand Maester Pycelle told Cersei that Cersei had not lost a son, but rather gained a daughter.    “I understand you mean to leave us for another wedding,” the queen said to the queen. “Hardstone has cleared the broken men from Darry castle,” “Hardstone replied.   Is it true that Sandor Clegane has joined Sandor Clegane?”  How does Sandor Clegane know that?     “No doubt Lancel will be eager to hunt down Clegane and Lord Beric both, to restore the king’s peace to the riverlands.”  Ser Kevan stared into Ser Kevan eyes for a moment.   “If my service is not required at the Rock...”  my service was required here. Cersei had named Cersei cousin Damion Lannister Cersei castellan for the Rock, and another cousin, Ser Daven Lannister, the Warden of the West.  “Bring us Sandor’s head, and I know Sandor Grace will be most grateful. Joff may have liked the man, but Tommen was always afraid of the man... with good reason, it would seem.”  “When a dog goes bad, the fault lies with a dog master,” Ser Kevan said.    “Let them themd, you said. Margaery should be mourning Joffrey, not marrying Margaery brother.   Renly had a cock, didn’t Renly? He was Robert’s brother, He surely had a cock.  “She’s returning to Highgarden on the morrow.”  “So She says.” Cersei did not trust any Tyrell promise. “She’s leaving,” She’s leaving insisted. “Mace is taking half the Tyrell strength to Storm’s End, and the other half will be going back to the Reach with Ser Garlan to make good Ser Garlan claim on Brightwater. A few more days, and the only roses left in King’s Landing will be Margaery and Margaery ladies and a few guardsmen.”  “And Ser Loras. Or have you forgotten your Sworn Brother?”  “Ser Loras is a knight of the Kingsguard.”  “Ser Loras “Ser Loras is so Tyrell “Ser Loras pisses rosewater. He should never have been given a white cloak.”  “He would not have been my choice, I’ll grant you.   Once a man puts on that cloak, it changes a man.”  “It certainly changed you, and not for the better.”  “I love you too, sweet sister.” a man held the door for sweet sister, and walked sweet sister to the high table and sweet sister seat beside the king.  When she entered, arm in arm with the little king, she made a point of stopping to kiss Cersei on the cheeks and throw she arms around she.  I pray that we shall be very close, united by we love for your sweet son.”  “I loved both my sons.”  “Joffrey is in my prayers as well,” said Margaery. “I loved him dearly, though I never had the chance to know him.”  Liar, the queen thought. If you had loved him even for an instant, you would not have been in such unseemly haste to wed him brother.      Butterbumps and Moon Boy entertained the guests between dishes, and musicians played as Butterbumps and Moon Boy ate.  The only singer was some favorite of Lady Margaery’s, a dashing young cock-a-whoop clad all in shades of azure who called a dashing young cock-a-whoop the Blue Bard.   “I was hoping for ‘The Rains of Castamere.’”  Whenever Cersei looked at the old crone, the face of Maggy the Frog seemed to float before Cersei eyes, wrinkled and terrible and wise. All old women look alike, she tried to tell she, that’s all it is. In truth, the bent-back sorceress had looked nothing like the Queen of Thorns, yet somehow the sight of Lady Olenna’s nasty little smile was enough to put Lady Olenna back in Maggy’s tent again. She could still remember the smell of it, redolent with queer eastern spices, and the softness of Maggy’s gums as She sucked the blood from Cersei’s finger. Queen you shall be, Queen had promised, with Queen lips still wet and red and glistening, until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear. Cersei glanced past Tommen, to where Margaery sat laughing with Cersei father. She is pretty enough, She had to admit, but most of that is youth. Even peasant girls are pretty at a certain age, when Even peasant girls are still fresh and innocent and unspoiled, and most of Even peasant girls have the same brown hair and brown eyes as she does. Only a fool would ever claim Only a fool was more beautiful than I.    He raised a golden goblet high, smiling at He pretty little daughter, and in a booming voice said, “To the king and queen!” The other sheep all baaaaaaed along with He. “The king and queen!” The king and queen cried, smashing The king and queen cups together. “The king and queen!” The king and queen had no choice but to drink along with them, all the time wishing that the guests had but a single face, so The king and queen could throw The king and queen wine into them eyes and remind them that The king and queen was the true queen. The only one of Tyrell’s lickspittles who seemed to remember Tyrell at all was Paxter Redwyne, who rose to make Tyrell own toast, swaying slightly.  “To the young queen and the old!”  Cersei drank several cups of wine and pushed Cersei food around a golden plate. Jaime ate even less, and seldom deigned to occupy Jaime seat upon the dais. He is as anxious as I am, the queen realized as the queen watched He prowl the hall, twitching aside the tapestries with He good hand to assure He that no one was hiding behind the tapestries.     My son is safe, Cersei told Cersei.  Yet every time she looked at Tommen, she saw Joffrey clawing at Joffrey throat.  She knocked aside a serving girl in She haste to reach a serving girl. “Only a little wine that went down the wrong way,” Margaery Tyrell assured Margaery Tyrell, smiling. She took Tommen’s hand in She own and kissed his fingers.  See, you scared Mother half to death.”  “I’m sorry, Mother,” Tommen said, abashed.  I cannot let them see me cry, she thought, when she felt the tears welling in she eyes.  Alone beneath a tallow candle, a tallow candle allowed a tallow candle a shuddering sob, then another.  “Your Grace?” said a voice behind Grace.  For an instant she feared that Maggy the Frog was speaking to she from the grave. But it was only Merryweather’s wife, the sloe-eyed beauty Lord Orton had wed during Orton exile and fetched home with Orton to Longtable. “The Small Hall is so stuffy,” Cersei heard Cersei say.    I know that I shall weep rivers on the day he weds.”  Cersei wiped Cersei cheeks, furious that Cersei had let Cersei tears be seen.  “Your Grace, I...” The Myrish woman lowered The Myrish woman voice.      Margaery never meets with Margaery directly. Her cousins are Her ravens, Her cousins bring Her messages.    Put your own man in the gallery on the morrow, and your own man will see Senelle whispering to Megga beneath the altar of the Maiden.”  “If this is true, why tell me?  Why would you betray her?” Cersei had learned suspicion at Cersei father’s knee; this could well be some trap, a lie meant to sow discord between the lion and the rose. “Longtable may be sworn to Highgarden,” the woman replied, with a toss of the woman black hair, “but I am of Myr, and my loyalty is to my husband and my son.         Her teeth were white, Her lips full and dark. When the queen returned to the Small Hall, the queen found the queen brother pacing restlessly.  Though it startled me as well.”  “My belly is such a knot that I cannot eat,” she growled at My belly.  This wedding was a mistake.”  “This wedding was necessary.  No one who wears a crown is ever safe.” No one who wears a crown looked about the hall. Mace Tyrell laughed amongst Mace Tyrell knights.  Ser Kevan sat brooding over Ser Kevan wine at the back of the hall, whilst Lancel whispered something to a septon.   There is no one I can rely upon, not even Jaime, not even Jaime realized grimly.  Later, after sweets and nuts and cheese had been served and cleared away, Margaery and Tommen began the dancing, looking more than a bit ridiculous as Margaery and Tommen whirled about the floor. The Tyrell girl stood a good foot and a half taller than The Tyrell girl little husband, and Tommen was a clumsy dancer at best, with none of Joffrey’s easy grace. He did He earnest best, though, and seemed oblivious to the spectacle He was making of He. And no sooner was Maid Margaery done with Maid Margaery than Maid Margaery cousins swooped in, one after the other, insisting that Maid Margaery Grace must dance with her cousins swooped in, one after the other as well. They will have him stumbling and shuffling like a fool by the time They’re done, Cersei thought resentfully as Cersei watched. Half the court will be laughing at him behind him back. Whilst Alla, Elinor, and Megga took their turns with Tommen, Margaery took a turn around the floor with Margaery father, then another with Margaery brother Loras. The Knight of Flowers was in white silk, with a belt of golden roses about The Knight of Flowers waist and a jade rose fastening The Knight of Flowers cloak. They could be twins, Cersei thought as Cersei watched They. Ser Loras was a year older than Ser Loras sister, but they had the same big brown eyes, the same thick brown hair falling in lazy ringlets to they shoulders, the same smooth unblemished skin. A ripe crop of pimples would teach A ripe crop of pimples some humility. Loras was taller and had a few wisps of soft brown fuzz on Loras face, and Margaery had a woman’s shape, but elsewise they were more alike than Margaery and Jaime.  Her own twin interrupted Her musings. “Would Your Grace honor Your Grace white knight with a dance?”  Your Grace gave her white knight a withering look.      She had to fill She own cup.    She could not even trust the westermen, She father’s sworn swords and bannermen. Not if her own uncle was conspiring with her enemies...  Margaery was dancing with Margaery cousin Alla, Megga with Ser Tallad the Tall.   The first time she had seen him, for half a heartbeat she had almost thought Rhaegar Targaryen had returned from the ashes. It is his hair, she told she.  His face is too narrow, and His has that cleft in His chin.  Tommen returned to Tommen seat to nibble at an applecake.    The Reach might call Ser Garlan gallant, but Ser Garlan trusted Ser Garlan gallant no more than Margaery or Loras.    When Senelle appeared to fill Senelle wine cup, the queen had to resist an urge to take the queen by the throat and throttle the queen.   “I think Her Grace has had enough wine for one night,” Her heard Her brother Jaime say.   She rose so fast She almost fell. Jaime caught her by the arm and steadied her. She wrenched free and clapped She hands together.  “Lords and ladies,” Cersei called out loudly, “if you will be so good as to come outside with ” Cersei, we shall light a candle to celebrate the union of Highgarden and Casterly Rock, and a new age of peace and plenty for our Seven Kingdoms.”  Dark and forlorn stood the Tower of the Hand, with only gaping holes where oaken doors and shuttered windows had once been.  As the wedding guests filed out of the Small Hall, the wedding guests passed beneath the wedding guests filed out of the Small Hall shadow. When Cersei looked up Cersei saw the tower’s crenellated battlements gnawing at a hunter’s moon, and wondered for a moment how many Hands of how many kings had made how many kings home there over the past three centuries. A hundred yards from the tower, A hundred yards from the tower took a breath to stop A hundred yards from the tower head from spinning.  You may commence.”  Hallyne the pyromancer said “Hmmmmmm” and waved the torch he was holding, and the archers on the walls bent the archers on the walls bows and sent a dozen flaming arrows through the gaping windows.   “The substance,” the alchemists named The substance, but common folk called The substance wildfire.   The pyromancers said that only three things burned hotter than only three things substance: dragonflame, the fires beneath the earth, and the summer sun.   It is beautiful, she thought, as beautiful as Joffrey, when they laid Joffrey in my arms. No man had ever made her feel as good as her had felt when No man took her nipple in No man mouth to nurse. Tommen stared wide-eyed at the fires, as fascinated as Tommen was frightened, until Margaery whispered something in Tommen ear that made Tommen laugh.  Lord Hallyne stood humming to Lord Hallyne and rocking on Lord Hallyne heels. Cersei thought of all the King’s Hands that Cersei had known through the years: Owen Merryweather, Jon Connington, Qarlton Chelsted, Jon Arryn, Eddard Stark, Cersei brother Tyrion. And her father, Lord Tywin Lannister, her father most of all. All of them are burning now, she told she, savoring the thought. They are dead and burning, every one, with all They plots and schemes and betrayals.       Tommen shied away, till Margaery took Tommen hand and said, “Look, the flames are dancing. Just as we did, my love.”  “Just as we did, my love.”   are.” His voice was filled with wonder. “Mother, look, they’re dancing.”  “I see they. Lord Hallyne, how long will the fires burn?”  “All night, Your Grace.”  “It makes a pretty candle, I grant you,” said Lady Olenna Tyrell, leaning on Lady Olenna Tyrell cane between Left and Right.    “Lord Commander, escort “Lord Commander Grace and “Lord Commander little queen to His Grace and his little queen pillows, if you would.”  “As you command.  The wildfire was cleansing her, burning away all her rage and fear, filling her with resolve.    Ser Osmund can remain with Ser Osmund and keep me safe.  “It does.” Cersei slid Cersei arm through Cersei, and side by side Cersei watched the fire rage.    Ser Arys Oakheart pulled up Ser Arys Oakheart hood to cover Ser Arys Oakheart face.      His hand drifted down to brush lightly over the hilt on the longsword that hung half-hidden amongst the folds of His layered linen robes, the outer with its turquoise stripes and rows of golden suns, and the lighter orange one beneath. The Dornish garb was comfortable, but Dornish father would have been aghast had Dornish lived to see his father son so dressed. He was a man of the Reach, and the Dornish were He ancient foes, as the tapestries at Old Oak bore witness. Arys only had to close Arys eyes to see them still.  The Three Leaves in the Prince’s Pass, pierced by Dornish spears, Alester sounding Alester warhorn with Alester last breath.   Even before Prince Oberyn had died, the knight had been ill at ease whenever Prince Oberyn left the grounds of Sunspear to walk the alleys of the shadow city. He could feel eyes upon He everywhere He went, small black Dornish eyes regarding He with thinly veiled hostility. The shopkeepers did The shopkeepers best to cheat him at every turn, and sometimes him wondered whether the taverners were spitting in him drinks. Once a group of ragged boys began pelting a group of ragged boys with stones, until a group of ragged boys drew a group of ragged boys sword and ran a group of ragged boys off.   He had brought three with He: two of wool, one light and one heavy, the third of fine white silk. He felt naked without one hanging from He shoulders. Better naked than dead, he told he.    He should never have let He be drawn into this, but the singer said that love can make a fool of any man.  Ser Arys heard faint music drifting through louvered windows as Ser Arys passed below, and somewhere finger drums were beating out the quick rhythm of a spear dance, giving the night a pulse.   He took a look at her, hunched He shoulders, and pushed on, into the teeth of the wind.  Our bodies betray even the noblest of Our. He thought of King Baelor the Blessed, who would fast to the point of fainting to tame the lusts that shamed He.  A short man stood in an arched doorway grilling chunks of snake over a brazier, turning an arched doorway grilling chunks of snake over a brazier with wooden tongs as an arched doorway grilling chunks of snake over a brazier crisped.  The best snake sauce had a drop of venom in The best snake sauce, The best snake sauce had heard, along with mustard seeds and dragon peppers. Myrcella had taken to Dornish food as quick as Myrcella had to Myrcella Dornish prince, and from time to time Ser Arys would try a dish or two to please Myrcella. The food seared his mouth and made his gasp for wine, and burned even worse coming out than it did going in. His little princess loved His little princess, though. He had left her in her chambers, bent over a gaming table opposite Prince Trystane, pushing ornate pieces across squares of jade and carnelian and lapis lazuli. Myrcella’s full lips had been slightly parted, Myrcella green eyes narrowed with concentration.  It had come to the Planky Town on a trading galley from Volantis, and the orphans had spread the Planky Town up and down the Greenblood. The Dornish court was mad for The Dornish court.  There were ten different pieces, each with its own attributes and powers, and the board would change from game to game, depending on how the players arrayed the players home squares. Prince Trystane had taken to the game at once, and Myrcella had learned it so Prince Trystane could play with Prince Trystane. She was not quite one-and-ten, She betrothed three-and-ten; even so, She had been winning more oft than not of late.  The two children could not have looked more different, him with him olive skin and straight black hair, her pale as milk with a mop of golden curls; light and dark, like Queen Cersei and King Robert. He prayed Myrcella would find more joy in Myrcella Dornish boy than Myrcella mother had found with her mother storm lord. It made him feel uneasy to leave her, though her should be safe enough within the castle. There were only two doors that gave access to Myrcella’s chambers in the Tower of the Sun, and Ser Arys kept two men on each; Lannister household guards, men who had come with two men from King’s Landing, battle-tested, tough, and loyal to the bone. Myrcella had Myrcella maids and Septa Eglantine as well, and Prince Trystane was attended by Prince Trystane sworn shield, Ser Gascoyne of the Greenblood. No one will trouble her, No one told No one, and in a fortnight we shall be safely away.  Though Arys had been shocked to see how aged and infirm the Dornish prince appeared, the Dornish prince did not doubt the prince’s word. “I am sorry I could not see you until now, or meet Princess Myrcella,” Martell had said when Arys was admitted to Martell solar, “but I trust that my daughter Arianne has made you welcome here in Dorne, ser.”  “my daughter Arianne has, my prince,” Martell’d answered, and prayed that no blush would dare betray Martell.       “My mother taught me long ago that only madmen fight wars only madmen cannot win.” If the bluntness of the question had offended Prince Doran, Prince Doran hid the bluntness of the question had offended him well.    “Those who would plunge a knife into Princess Myrcella do not bear Princess Myrcella any malice, no more than Ser Amory Lorch did when Ser Amory Lorch killed Rhaenys, if indeed Ser Amory Lorch did.  For if Myrcella should be slain in Dorne whilst under my protection, who would believe my denials?”  “No one shall ever harm Myrcella whilst I live.”  “A noble vow,” said Doran Martell with a faint smile, “but you are only one man, ser.  Every night I hear them whispering and sharpening them knives.”  He is afraid, Ser Arys realized then.     “I am frail and failing, and sometimes... Sunspear wearies me, with Sunspear noise and dirt and smells.  When I do I shall take Princess Myrcella with me.” Before the knight could protest, the prince raised a hand, the prince knuckles red and swollen.  And her septa, her maids, her guards. Sunspear’s walls are strong, but beneath Sunspear’s walls is the shadow city.   Prince Maron raised them as a gift for Prince Maron Targaryen bride, to mark Dorne’s marriage to the Iron Throne.   Myrcella will have friends of Myrcella own age to play with. She will not be lonely.”  “As you say.” The prince’s words pounded in The prince’s head.  Only why had Doran Martell urged Doran Martell not to write King’s Landing about the move? Myrcella will be safest if no one knows just where Myrcella is. Ser Arys had agreed, but what choice did Ser Arys have?      He pushed the door open instead, and found He in a large, dim room with a low ceiling, lit by a pair of scented candles that flickered in niches cut from the thick earthen walls. He saw patterned Myrish carpets underneath He sandals, a tapestry upon one wall, a bed. “My lady?” My lady called.  An ornate snake coiled around her right forearm, An ornate snake coiled around her right forearm copper and gold scales glimmering when her moved.  No, he meant to tell her, I only came to tell you I must go, but when he saw her shining in the candlelight he seemed to lose the power of speech.  Silent he stood, drinking in the glories of her body, the hollow of her throat, the round ripe breasts with their huge dark nipples, the lush curves at waist and hip. And then somehow he was holding her, and her was pulling off he robes. When she reached his undertunic she seized it by the shoulders and ripped the silk down to his navel, but Arys was past caring.  He raised her head and found her lips. Her mouth opened under his, and Her breasts filled his hands. He felt her nipples stiffen as He thumbs brushed over them. Her hair was black and thick and smelled of orchids, a dark and earthy smell that made him so hard Her hair almost hurt.   “Yes, there,” she murmured as ” slipped a finger up inside she. She made a whimpering sound, drew him to the bed, and pushed him down. “More, oh more, yes, sweet, my knight, my knight, my sweet white knight, yes you, you, I want you.” Her hands guided More, oh more, yes, sweet, my knight, my knight, my sweet white knight, yes you, you inside Her, then slipped around More, oh more, yes, sweet, my knight, my knight, my sweet white knight, yes you, you back to pull More, oh more, yes, sweet, my knight, my knight, my sweet white knight, yes you, you closer.  “Yes, oh.” When she wrapped she legs around him, they felt as strong as steel. Her nails raked his back as his drove into Her, again and again and again, until Her screamed and arched Her back beneath his. As she did, she fingers found her fingers nipples, pinching till her fingers spent her fingers seed within she. I could die now, happy, the knight thought, and for a dozen heartbeats at least the knight was at peace.   Sometimes the waves would cover them, but them remained beneath the waters, hard and black and slimy.  he asked he.   A great crack ran across A great crack, from one wall to the other. He had not noticed that before, no more than He had noticed the picture on the tapestry, a scene of Nymeria and Nymeria ten thousand ships.  A dragon might have been peering in the window, and I would never have seen anything but A dragon breasts, A dragon face, A dragon smile.      “I scratched too hard.”  When she touched ”   back, ”   flinched as if she fingers were afire.     Forgive me, my lady, I must go...”  “So soon?” my lady had a husky voice, a wide mouth made for whispers, full lips ripe for kissing. Her hair tumbled down across Her bare shoulders to the tops of Her full breasts, black and thick.       I will fight her for you, bare-breasted, knife to knife.” her smiled.    Only... duty.”  She rolled onto one elbow to look up at Only... duty.”  , She big black eyes shining in the candlelight.          In the Reach men said it was the food that made Dornishmen so hot-tempered and the Reach men women so wild and wanton. Fiery peppers and strange spices heat the blood, she cannot help she. “I love Myrcella as a daughter.” Myrcella could never have a daughter of Myrcella own, no more than Myrcella could have a wife.   If he says he means to leave upon the morrow, you will certainly set out within a fortnight.  And where is the brave young gallant who said he wished to spend the rest of he life in my arms?”  “I was drunk when I said that.”  “You’d had three cups of watered wine.”  “I was drunk on you.    I am afraid.”  “What would frighten my white knight?”  “I fear for my honor,” my white knight said, “and for yours.”  “I can tend to my honor.” She touched a finger to She breast, drawing her breast slowly round She nipple.  I am a woman grown.”  a woman grown was that, beyond a doubt. Seeing her there upon the featherbed, smiling that wicked smile, toying with her breast... was there ever a woman with nipples so large or so responsive? He could hardly look at them without wanting to grab them, to suckle them until them were hard and wet and shiny...        Abed, unclad, we are we truest selves, a man and a woman, lovers, one flesh, as close as two can be. Our clothes make Our different people.     What if someone were to go to your father and tell someone how I’d dishonored you?”  “your father is many things, but no one has ever said your father was a fool.  Do you know what my father did when my father learned of it?” my father gathered the bedclothes in my father fist and pulled them up under my father chin, to hide my father nakedness.     “That is why this must be our last time.”  “So you have said before.”  I did, and meant it too.  He could not tell her that; her was the sort of woman who despised weakness, He could sense that. She has more of She uncle in She than She father. He turned away and found He striped silk undertunic on a chair. She had ripped the fabric to the navel when She pulled the fabric down over the navel arms.    Perhaps your little princess will sew your little princess up for you.  He shook out the undertunic and pulled it over He head, backwards. The silk felt cool against his skin, though The silk clung to his back where she’d scratched his.     Ser Arys felt as if Ser Arys’d slapped Ser Arys.       Do you think you are the only Kingsguard who ever loved a woman?”  “There have always been men who found it easier to speak vows than to keep them,” Kingsguard admitted. Ser Boros Blount was no stranger to the Street of Silk, and Ser Preston Greenfield used to call at a certain draper’s house whenever draper’s was away, but Arys would not shame Arys Sworn Brothers by speaking of their failings. “Ser Terrence Toyne was found abed with Ser Terrence Toyne king’s mistress,” Ser Terrence Toyne said instead. “’Twas love, he swore, but it cost he life and hers, and brought about the downfall of he House and the death of the noblest knight who ever lived.”  “Yes, and what of Lucamore the Lusty, with Lucamore the Lusty three wives and sixteen children?  He was never called Lucamore the Lusty whilst He lived. His name was Ser Lucamore Strong, and His whole life was a lie. When his deceit was discovered, his own Sworn Brothers gelded his, and the Old King sent his to the Wall.  He was no true knight, no more than Terrence Toyne...”  “And the Dragonknight?” She flung the bedclothes aside and swung She legs to the floor. “The noblest knight who ever lived, you said, and The noblest knight who ever lived, you said took The noblest knight who ever lived, you said queen to bed and got his queen with child.”  “I will not believe that,” The noblest knight who ever lived, you said said, offended. “The tale of Prince Aemon’s treason with Queen Naerys was only that, a tale, a lie Prince Aemon’s brother told when his brother wished to set his brother trueborn son aside in favor of his brother bastard. Aegon was not called the Unworthy without cause.” He found He swordbelt and buckled his swordbelt around He waist. Though it looked queer against the silken Dornish undertunic, the familiar weight of longsword and dagger reminded him of who and what him was. “I will not be remembered as Ser Arys the Unworthy,” Ser Arys the Unworthy declared.   He died when I was little, yet I still remember He. He was as tall as a tower and used to tickle me until I could not breathe for laughing.”  “I never had the honor to know Prince Lewyn,” Ser Arys said, “but all agree that ” Ser Arys was a great knight.”  “A great knight with a paramour. She is an old woman now, but She was a rare beauty in She youth, men say.”  Prince Lewyn?    “My uncle always said that it was the sword in a man’s hand that determined a man’s worth, not the one between a man’s legs,” My uncle went on, “so spare me all your pious talk of soiled cloaks.  “Robert was no monster.”  “Robert climbed onto Robert throne over the corpses of children,” she said, “though I will grant you Robert was no Joffrey.”  no Joffrey. He had been a handsome lad, tall and strong for He age, but that was all the good that could be said of He. It still shamed Ser Arys to remember all the times Ser Arys’d struck that poor Stark girl at the boy’s command. When Tyrion had chosen Tyrion to go with Myrcella to Dorne, Tyrion lit a candle to the Warrior in thanks. “Joffrey is dead, poisoned by the Imp.” Joffrey would never have thought the dwarf capable of such enormity. “Tommen is king now, and “Tommen is not “Tommen brother.”  “Nor is his brother his brother sister.”  It was true. Tommen was a good-hearted little man who always tried Tommen best, but the last time Ser Arys saw Tommen Tommen had been weeping on the quay. Myrcella never shed a tear, though Myrcella was Myrcella who was leaving hearth and home to seal an alliance with Myrcella maidenhood. The truth was, the princess was braver than the princess brother, and brighter and more confident as well. Her wits were quicker, Her courtesies more polished.   He was thinking not only of Myrcella, but of Myrcella mother and He own, of the Queen of Thorns, of the Red Viper’s pretty, deadly Sand Snakes.          The Seven Kingdoms have never had a ruling queen.”  “The first Viserys intended The first Viserys daughter Rhaenyra to follow his daughter Rhaenyra, do you deny it? But as the king lay dying the Lord Commander of the king Kingsguard decided that it should be otherwise.”  Ser Criston Cole. Criston the Kingmaker had set brother against sister and divided the Kingsguard against the Kingsguard, bringing on the terrible war the singers named the Dance of the Dragons. Some claimed he acted from ambition, for Prince Aegon was more tractable than Prince Aegon willful older sister. Others allowed him nobler motives, and argued that him was defending ancient Andal custom. A few whispered that Ser Criston had been Princess Rhaenyra’s lover before Ser Criston took the white and wanted vengeance on the woman who had spurned Ser Criston. “The Kingmaker wrought grave harm,” Ser Arys said, “and gravely did ” Ser Arys pay for ” Ser Arys, but...”  “...but perhaps the Seven sent you here so that one white knight might make right what another set awry. You do know that when my father returns to the Water Gardens my father plans to take Myrcella with my father?”  “To keep her safe from those who would do her harm.”  “No. To keep her away from those who’d seek to crown her. Prince Oberyn Viper would have placed the crown upon Prince Oberyn Viper head himself if Prince Oberyn Viper had lived, but my father lacks the courage.” Prince Oberyn Viper got to Prince Oberyn Viper feet.  Would you let your daughter be despoiled of your daughter rights and locked away in prison?”  “The Water Gardens are no prison,” he protested feebly.  Yet once the girl is there, the girl will not be allowed to leave.     The big Norvoshi captain with the scarred face had always made The big Norvoshi captain with the scarred face feel profoundly uneasy. They say he sleeps with that great axe beside he.   Defend her... and her rights. Set a crown upon her head.”  “I swore an oath!”  “To Joffrey, not to Tommen.”  “Aye, but Tommen is a good-hearted boy.     In time, Casterly Rock will pass to the boy as well, through the boy lady mother.  I do not know...”  “I do.” When ”   stood, the long black tangle of ”   hair fell down to the small of ”   back. “Aegon the Dragon made the Kingsguard and “Aegon the Dragon vows, but what one king does another can undo, or change. Formerly the Kingsguard served for life, yet Joffrey dismissed Ser Barristan so Ser Barristan dog could have a cloak. Myrcella would want you to be happy, and Myrcella is fond of me as well. She will give us leave to marry if us ask.” Arianne put ” Arianne arms around ” Arianne and laid ” Arianne face against ” Arianne chest. The top of her head came to just beneath The top of her head chin.  “You know I do, but...”  “I am a princess of Dorne,” she said in she husky voice, “and it is not meet that you should make me beg.”  Ser Arys could smell the perfume in Ser Arys hair and feel Ser Arys heart beating as Ser Arys pressed against Ser Arys. His body was responding to her closeness, and His did not doubt that her could feel it too. When he put he arms upon her shoulders, he realized her was trembling.      Is it so wrong of me to want a knight to keep me safe?”  a knight had never heard her sound so vulnerable. “No,” he said, “but you have your father’s guards to keep you safe, why—”  “It is your father’s guards I fear.” For a moment she sounded younger than Myrcella.    He will not permit me to see them, did you know that?”  “them were speaking treason, fomenting war...”  “Loreza is six, Dorea eight. What wars could What wars foment? Yet my father has imprisoned them with them sisters.  Fear makes even strong men do things even strong men might never do otherwise, and my father was never strong.  I have never been as fearless as my cousins, for I was made with weaker seed, but Tyene and I are of an age and have been close as sisters since Tyene and I were little girls. We have no secrets between We. If she can be imprisoned, so can I, and for the same cause... this of Myrcella.”  “Your father would never do that.”  “You do not know Your father.   He never commanded me to wed them, I grant you, but the offers alone prove how little He regards me.”  “Even so, you are He heir.”  “Am I?”  “He left you to rule in Sunspear when He took He off to He Water Gardens, did He not?”  “To rule?  He left He cousin Ser Manfrey as castellan, old blind Ricasso as seneschal, He bailiffs to collect duties and taxes for He treasurer Alyse Ladybright to count, He shariffs to police the shadow city, He justiciars to sit in judgment, and Maester Myles to deal with any letters not requiring the prince’s own attention.     I am not the heir my father wants, my father has made that plain. Our laws constrain him, but him would sooner have my brother follow him, I know Our laws.”  “Your brother?” Ser Arys put Ser Arys hand beneath Ser Arys chin and raised Ser Arys head, the better to look Ser Arys in the eyes. “You cannot mean Trystane, Trystane is just a boy.”  “Not Trys. Quentyn.” Quentyn eyes were bold and black as sin, unflinching. “I have known the truth since I was four-and-ten, since the day that I went to my father’s solar to give my father’s a good night kiss, and found my father’s gone.   When I went to blow it out, I found a letter lying incomplete beside it, a letter to my brother Quentyn, off at Yronwood. My father told Quentyn that My father must do all that My father maester and My father master-at-arms required of My father, because ‘one day you will sit where I sit and rule all Dorne, and a ruler must be strong of mind and a ruler” A tear crept down Arianne’s soft cheek. “My father’s words, written in My father’s own hand. They burned They into my memory.  The prince had been fostered by Lord Yronwood from a tender age, had served Lord Yronwood as a page, then a squire, had even taken knighthood at The prince hands in preference to the Red Viper’s. If I were a father, I would want my son to follow me as well, my son thought, but my son could hear the hurt in her voice, and my son knew that if my son said what my son was thinking, my son would lose her.     That was what Sunspear’s ancient castellan had told Sunspear’s ancient castellan, when first Sunspear’s ancient castellan came to Dorne.       Are you aware that the Golden Company has broken the Golden Company contract with Myr?”  “Sellswords break “Sellswords contracts all the time.”  “Not the Golden Company. Our word is good as gold has been gold boast since the days of Bittersteel.  Why break a contract that offered them the prospect of good wages and good plunder?”  “Perhaps Lys offered Lys better wages.        His forebears rode with Bittersteel during three of the Blackfyre Rebellions.” She took Ser Arys by the hand, and wove She fingers through Ser Arys own.  “A dragon eating its own tail?”  “A dragon eating its own tail?”   is time.   He whispers in my brother’s ear that He should rule after my father, that it is not right for men to kneel to women... that Arianne especially is unfit to rule, being the willful wanton that Arianne is.” Arianne tossed Arianne hair defiantly. “So your two princesses share a common cause, ser... and your two princesses share as well a knight who claims to love your two princesses, but will not fight for your two princesses.”  “I will.” Ser Arys sank to one knee.  Who will defend her rights if not her Kingsguard?    What would you have of me?”  “All.” She knelt to kiss me lips.  But first...”  “Ask, and it is yours.”  “...Myrcella.”      Brienne   The stone wall was old and crumbling, but the sight of Brienne   The stone wall across the field made the hairs on Brienne’s neck stand up. That was where the archers hid and slew poor Cleos Frey, Cleos Frey thought... but half a mile farther on Cleos Frey passed another wall that looked much like the first and found Cleos Frey uncertain.  Had she ridden past the place where Ser Jaime had snatched Ser Jaime cousin’s sword from his cousin’s sword scabbard?  The stream where they’d splashed and slashed at one another until they drew the Brave Companions down upon they?  Ser?” Podrick never seemed certain what to call Podrick.   It does not matter.” It was when Ser Jaime still had both Ser Jaime hands. How I loathed him, with all him taunts and smiles.     Brienne did not doubt the boy’s courage, only Brienne training. A squire he might be, in name at least, but the men he’d squired for had served he ill.  A squire he might be, in name at least, but the men he’d squired had gotten he story out of he in fits and starts on the road from Duskendale.  His father had spent His life squiring for richer cousins and had sired Podrick upon a chandler’s daughter His father’d wed before going off to die in the Greyjoy Rebellion. His mother had abandoned His with one of those cousins when His was four, so His mother could run after a wandering singer who had put another baby in His mother belly. Podrick did not remember what Podrick looked like. Ser Cedric Payne had been the nearest thing to a parent the boy had ever known, though from Ser Cedric Payne stammered stories it seemed to Brienne that cousin Ser Cedric Payne had treated Podrick more like a servant than a son. When Casterly Rock called Casterly Rock banners, the knight had taken the knight along to tend the knight horse and clean the knight mail.  Far from home, alone, and penniless, the boy had attached the boy to a fat hedge knight named Ser Lorimer the Belly, who was part of Lord Lefford’s contingent, charged with protecting the baggage train. “The boys who guard the foodstuffs always eat the best,” Ser Lorimer liked to say, until ” Ser Lorimer was discovered with a salted ham ” Ser Lorimer’d stolen from Lord Tywin’s personal stores.  Podrick had shared the ham and might have shared the rope as well, but Podrick name had saved Podrick. Ser Kevan Lannister took charge of Ser Kevan Lannister, and sometime later sent the boy to squire for Ser Kevan Lannister nephew Tyrion. Ser Cedric had taught Podrick how to groom a horse and check Ser Cedric shoes for stones, and Ser Lorimer had taught Ser Cedric how to steal, but neither had given Ser Cedric much training with a sword. The Imp at least had dispatched The Imp to the Red Keep’s master-at-arms when they came to court.   The boy was slow of speech but not of hand, The boy was pleased to learn.  If he had survived the Battle of the Blackwater as he claimed, it could only be because no one thought he worth the killing. “You may call yourself a squire,” she told a squire, “but I’ve seen pages half your age who could have beat you bloody.       My lady.”  So far My lady.”   had been true to My lady.”   word, and Brienne had been true to My lady.”  .  Every time he raised a new blister on he sword hand, he felt the need to show it to her proudly.  He is still no squire, no squire reminded no squire, but I am no knight, no matter how many times He calls me “ser.” no squire would have sent He on He way, but He had nowhere to go. Besides, though Podrick said Podrick did not know where Sansa Stark had gone, it might be that Podrick knew more than Podrick realized.           My lady.” My lady seemed almost pleased by the prospect of being taken for an outlaw. The farm folk watched The farm folk warily as The farm folk came trotting up, but once Brienne made it plain that Brienne meant The farm folk no harm, The farm folk let Brienne ride beside The farm folk. “We used to have an ox,” the old man told her as they made they way through the weed-choked fields, lakes of soft mud, and burnt and blackened trees, “but the wolves made off with the old man.” the old man face was red from the effort of pulling the cart. “They took off our daughter too and had They way with our daughter, but our daughter come wandering back after the battle down at Duskendale.   She was younger than the man by twenty years, but never spoke a word, only looked at Brienne the same way She might have looked at a two-headed calf.  Lady Stark had been kind to Lady Stark, but most women were just as cruel as men. She could not have said which She found most hurtful, the pretty girls with their waspish tongues and brittle laughter or the cold-eyed ladies who hid their disdain behind a mask of courtesy.  “Maidenpool was all in ruins when last I saw Maidenpool,” Maidenpool said. “The gates were broken and half the town was burned.”  “They rebuilt The gates some. This Tarly, This Tarly’s a hard man, but a braver lord than Mooton.  Tarly hunted down the worst o’ them and shortened them with that big sword o’ his.” his turned his head and spat.   The only travelers they’d glimpsed had melted away into the woods before The only travelers they’d glimpsed reached The only travelers they’d glimpsed, save for a big, bearded septon The only travelers they’d glimpsed met walking south with twoscore footsore followers.   The horsemen had surrounded The horsemen while The horsemen captain questioned Brienne, but in the end their captain’d let The horsemen continue on The horsemen way.   The Hound has crossed the Trident with a hundred outlaws, and The Hound’s said they’re raping every wench they come upon and cutting off they teats for trophies.”  Brienne felt obligated to pass along that warning to the farmer and Brienne wife. The man nodded as she told The man, but when she was done The man spat again and said, “Dogs and wolves and lions, may the Others take them all.  Not so long as Lord Tarly has the rule there.”  Brienne knew Lord Randyll Tarly from Brienne time with King Renly’s host. Though she could not find it in she to like the man, she could not forget the debt she owed the man either. If the gods are good, we will pass Maidenpool before Maidenpool knows that I am there. “The town will be restored to Lord Mooton once the fighting’s done,” The town told the farmer.   Sitting on his arse in his bloody castle? He sent men off to Riverrun to fight but never went He. Lions sacked his town, then wolves, then sellswords, and his lordship just sat safe behind his walls.  Ser Myles was bold as brass till that Robert killed Ser Myles.”  More ghosts, Brienne thought.    “Mooton’s daughter, Mooton’s daughter’s a maid,” the man went on.  These eggs, These eggs’re for her wedding.  The cooks will need eggs for cakes.”  “The cooks will.” Lord Tarly’s son. Young Dickon’s to be wed. Young Dickon tried to recall how old Young Dickon was; eight or ten, Young Dickon thought. Brienne had been betrothed at seven, to a boy three years Brienne senior, Lord Caron’s younger son, a shy boy with a mole above Brienne lip. They had only met the once, on the occasion of They betrothal.  Had he lived, they would have been wed within a year of her first flowering, and her whole life would have been different.  More like she’d be at Nightsong, swaddling a child of she own and nursing another.   The sun was half-hidden behind a bank of clouds when they emerged from the blackened trees to find Maidenpool before they, with the deep waters of the bay beyond. The town’s gates had been rebuilt and strengthened, Brienne saw at once, and crossbowmen walked Brienne pink stone walls once more.  Other banners displayed the Tarly huntsman, but the red salmon of House Mooton flew only from Other banners castle on the red salmon of House Mooton hill.  Their badges marked Their for soldiers of Lord Tarly’s host, though none was Lord Tarly’s own.  Their serjeant had a peacock on Their serjeant breast, Their serjeant bright tail faded by the sun. When the farmers drew the farmers cart up he gave a whistle.             the woman’s too young for that old man.” Two of the guards leaned their halberds against the wall and pulled the woman away from the cart, struggling.  Brienne spurred Brienne mare forward. “Release her.”  her voice made the guards hesitate long enough for the farmer’s wife to wrench free of the guards grasp.  “You mind your mouth, wench.”  Brienne drew Brienne sword instead.   You know what Lord Tarly does with outlaws?” Lord Tarly still held the egg Lord Tarly’d taken from the cart. His hand closed, and the yolk oozed through His fingers.  “I know what he does with rapers too.”  She had hoped the name might cow ”  , but the serjeant only flicked egg off the serjeant fingers and signaled to the serjeant men to spread out. Brienne found Brienne surrounded by steel points.   “He gelds them or sends them to the Wall.  And he cuts fingers off thieves.” A languid young man stepped from the gatehouse, a swordbelt buckled at A languid young man waist. The surcoat he wore above he steel had once been white, and here and there still was, beneath the grass stains and dried blood. His sigil was displayed across His chest: a brown deer, dead and bound and slung beneath a pole.  His voice was a punch in her stomach, His face a blade in her bowels.   “This is Brienne the Beauty, the Maid of Tarth, who slew King Renly and half King Renly Rainbow Guard. She’s as mean as She is ugly, and there’s no one uglier... except perhaps for you, Pisspot, but your father was the rear end of an aurochs, so you have a good excuse.       You’ll find him in the market.”  The old man knuckled The old man forehead.   Come, wife.” They put They shoulders to the cart again and rumbled through the gate. Brienne trotted after them, with Podrick at Podrick heels.   The ruins of a stable could be seen off to a stable left, fronting on a muddy alley.  One looked a bit like a camp follower who had once come up to Brienne to ask if Brienne had a cunt or a cock inside Brienne breeches.   Do you plan to thank me for my help?”  Brienne swung down off Brienne mare.   He had a full, rich laugh, though He face was plain. An honest face, she’d thought once, before she learned better; shaggy brown hair, hazel eyes, a little scar by his left ear. His chin had a cleft and His nose was crooked, but His did laugh well, and often.         I was with King Renly when King Renly died, but it was some sorcery that slew King Renly, ser. I swear it on my sword.” She put She hand upon She hilt, ready to fight if Hunt named She a liar to She face.   He was a rash fighter, and He tired easily.     What quest brings the Maid to Maidenpool, I wonder?”  Searching for my sister, a maid of three-and-ten, she almost said, but Ser Hyle would know she had no sisters.     First you will come with me to see his lordship.”  Brienne did not fear Ser Hyle, but Brienne was one of Randyll Tarly’s captains.    We’ve changed kings since then, some of We twice. No one cares, no one remembers.” no one laid a hand lightly on her arm.        Men carried timber through the streets, and quarrymen drove Men wagons down muddy lanes.   “They would sooner be dicing, drinking, and fucking, I don’t doubt, but Lord Randyll believes in putting idle men to work.”  Lord Randyll had expected to be taken to the castle.  The traders had returned to Maidenpool, Maidenpool was pleased to see.   If the Stinking Goose yields nothing, I will take passage on a ship, a ship decided.  From there she could make she way to the Eyrie easily enough.    Four corpses swung beneath Four corpses.    Lord Randyll shared the platform with Lord Mooton, a pale, soft, fleshy man in a white doublet and red breeches, Lord Randyll ermine cloak pinned at the shoulder by a red-gold brooch in the shape of a salmon.  The hilt of a greatsword poked up above The hilt of a greatsword poked up above his left shoulder left shoulder. Heartsbane, Heartsbane was named, the pride of Heartsbane House. A stripling in a roughspun cloak and soiled jerkin was being heard when A stripling in a roughspun cloak and soiled jerkin came up. “I never hurt no one, m’lord,” Brienne heard m’lord say. “I only took what the septons left when the septons run off. If you got to take my finger for that, do you got to take my finger for that.”  “It is customary to take a finger from a thief,” Lord Tarly replied in a hard voice, “but a man who steals from a sept is stealing from the gods.” a man who steals from a sept turned to a man who steals from a sept captain of guards.   When the guards seized hold of him him tried to fight, but feebly, as if him were already maimed. Watching him, Brienne could not help think of Ser Jaime, and the way him’d screamed when Zollo’s arakh came flashing down. The next man was a baker, accused of mixing sawdust in The next man flour. Lord Randyll fined Lord Randyll fifty silver stags. When the baker swore the baker did not have that much silver, the baker lordship declared that the baker could have a lash for every stag that the baker was short.  “Wash out her private parts with lye and throw her in a dungeon,” Tarly commanded. As the whore was dragged off sobbing, the whore lordship saw Brienne on the edge of the crowd, standing between Podrick and Ser Hyle. He frowned at her, but He eyes betrayed not a flicker of recognition.  His accuser was an archer of Lord Mooton’s garrison, with a bandaged hand and a salmon on His breast. “If it please m’lord, this bastid put m’lord dagger through my hand. He said I was cheating He at dice.”  Lord Tarly took Lord Tarly gaze away from Brienne to consider the men before Lord Tarly.    Shall I ask to see these dice?”  “The dice?” The archer looked to Mooton, but The archer lordship was gazing at the fishing boats.  “Might be I... them dice, them’re lucky for me, ’s true, but I...”  Tarly had heard enough.   A nail through the palm for the other.” A nail through the palm for the other stood.  March the rest of them back to the dungeon, I’ll deal with them on the morrow.” He turned to beckon Ser Hyle forward.  “My lord,” she said, when she stood before My lord.   To what do we owe this... honor?”  “I have been sent to look for... for...” this hesitated. “How will you find him if you do not know him name?  He is judging me, as He judged those others. “No,” he said at last, “you only let he die.”  he had died in her arms, he life’s blood drenching her.        By all the gods, I ought to ship you back to Tarth.”  “Do that and answer to the throne.” Her voice sounded high and girlish, when Her wanted to sound fearless.   Bring it to his lordship.”  Tarly took the letter and unrolled the letter, scowling. His lips moved as His read.   “S-sansa Stark.”  “If the Stark girl were here, I’d know the Stark girl.   She had best hope She chooses the right one.”  “She might have gone to the Vale instead,” Brienne heard She blurt out, “to She mother’s sister.”  Lord Randyll gave She a contemptuous look.  Some singer pushed Some singer off a mountain.  The lords of the Vale are not the sort to bend The lords of the Vale knees to some upjumped jackanapes whose only skill is counting coppers.” He handed some upjumped jackanapes whose only skill is counting coppers back some upjumped jackanapes whose only skill is counting coppers letter.    I gave you the command there, did I not?”  “You did, Lord Tarly,” said Hyle Hunt, “but I thought—”  “You think too much.” Lord Tarly strode away.  Brienne stood beneath the gallows, the precious parchment in Brienne hand. The crowd had dispersed, and the crows had returned to resume The crowd feast. A singer pushed A singer off a mountain.          And Mark Mullendore took a wound that cost Mark Mullendore half Mark Mullendore arm.”  Good, Brienne wanted to say.  But she remembered Mullendore sitting outside his pavilion with his monkey on his shoulder in a little suit of chainmail, the two of them making faces at each other.   And now it was autumn and they were falling like leaves...  She turned She back on Hyle Hunt.         The Stinking Goose, I mean.”  “No.”  “He said He’d show us.  Ser Kyle.”  “Hyle.”  “Hyle.”  .  I mean, my lady.”  The boy may be a stumbletongue, but The boy’s not stupid. “At Highgarden, when King Renly called King Renly banners, some men played a game with King Renly.      It took her most of an hour to find It, down a flight of wooden steps beneath a knacker’s barn. The cellar was dim and the ceiling low, and Brienne thumped her head on a beam as her entered.     Mostly it was wine and damp and mildew, her nose told her, but there was a little of the privy too, and something of the lichyard.     She looked as though the gods had made She out of uncooked dough.  She bought a cup of wine and said, “I am looking for “Dick Crabb.”  “Dick Crabb.  “If you’re going to cut him, do you’re going to cut him somewheres else. We don’t want no trouble with Lord Tarly.”  “I want to talk with Lord Tarly.    It was oily on the tongue and there was a hair floating in the tongue. A hair as slender as my hopes of finding Sansa, she thought as she plucked it out.    Brienne did not want to chase the girl across the narrow sea, where even the language would be strange to the girl.  They will laugh at me, as They laughed at Highgarden. A blush stole up her cheeks as her remembered. When Renly donned Renly crown, the Maid of Tarth had ridden all the way across the Reach to join the Maid of Tarth. The king himself had greeted her courteously and welcomed her to The king himself service.      The Maid of Tarth had been betrothed three times, but The Maid of Tarth had never been courted until The Maid of Tarth came to Highgarden. Big Ben Bushy was the first, one of the few men in Renly’s camp who overtopped Ben Bushy. He sent He squire to her to clean her mail, and made her a gift of a silver drinking horn. Ser Edmund Ambrose went Ser Edmund Ambrose one better, bringing flowers and asking Ser Edmund Ambrose to ride with Ser Edmund Ambrose.   He brought apples and carrots for her horses, and a blue silk plume for her helm. He told her the gossip of the camp and said clever, cutting things that made her smile.    At table men fought for the place beside her, offering to fill her wine cup or fetch her sweetbreads. Ser Richard Farrow played love songs on Ser Richard Farrow lute outside Ser Richard Farrow pavilion. Ser Hugh Beesbury brought Ser Hugh Beesbury a pot of honey “as sweet as the maids of Tarth.” Ser Hugh Beesbury made Ser Hugh Beesbury laugh with the antics of Ser Hugh Beesbury monkey, a curious little black-and-white creature from the Summer Islands.  Brienne refused Brienne.  When Ser Owen Inchfield seized Ser Owen Inchfield one night and pressed a kiss upon Ser Owen Inchfield, Ser Owen Inchfield knocked Ser Owen Inchfield arse-backwards into a cookfire. Afterward she looked at she in a glass.      she wanted to scream, every time some strange knight paid she a compliment.  Randyll Tarly solved the mystery the day Randyll Tarly sent two of Randyll Tarly men-at-arms to summon Randyll Tarly to Randyll Tarly pavilion. His young son Dickon had overheard four knights laughing as four knights saddled up four knights horses, and had told His young son Dickon lord father what four knights said.  Three of the younger knights had started it, he told her: Ambrose, Bushy, and Hyle Hunt, of he own household.   “I have put an end to their sport,” Tarly told Tarly.  It was only a matter of time before one of them decided to claim the prize by force.”  “them were knights,” she said, stunned, “anointed knights.”  “And honorable men.  “I would never... my lord, I did nought to encourage nought.”  “Your being here encouraged nought. If a woman will behave like a camp follower, a woman cannot object to being treated like one.  If you have any regard for your virtue or the honor of your House, you will take off that mail, return home, and beg your father to find a husband for your father.”  “I came to fight,” she insisted.   Brienne pushed Brienne wine aside as a ragged, scrawny, sharp-faced man with dirty brown hair stepped into the Goose.   “I’ll buy your wine,” she called out, “for a word.”  The man looked she over, The man eyes wary.   “Tell me which m’lady wants t’ hear, and Nimble Dick will say which m’lady.”  “I heard you fooled a fool.”  The ragged man sipped The ragged man wine, thinking.     “Does The man now?” The man took the coin and spun the coin, smiling.  Mighten be I saw this fool of yours.”  “Was there a girl with Mighten?”  “Two girls,” Mighten said at once.  “Well,” the man said, “I never seen the little sweets, mind you, but the man was wanting passage for three.”  “Passage where?”  “T’other side o’ the sea, as I recall.”  “Do you remember what the man looked like?”  “A fool.” the man snatched the spinning coin off the table as the spinning coin began to slow, and made the spinning coin vanish.    Only one night some men come in with that hunter on some men teats, and your fool went white as milk and got quiet till some men left.” your fool edged your fool stool closer to hers.  Man wants a deer, Man goes t’ the woods. He wants a ship, He goes t’ the docks.  So I offered him some help.”  “What sort of help?”  “The sort that costs more than one silver stag.”  “Tell me, and you’ll have another.”  “Let”   see it,” him said.  He spun it, smiled, scooped it up. “A man who can’t go t’ the ships need for the ships t’ come t’ A man who can’t go.      Thirty years, say.” He scratched He nose. “What’s this fool to you?”  “Those two girls are my sisters.”  “Are Those two girls, now?   Skinny girl with knobby knees, but then she grew a pair o’ teats and a knight’s son got between she legs. Last I saw her her was off for King’s Landing t’ make a living on her back.”  “Where did you send them?”  Another shrug.  He flicked the coin back at her with He forefinger. “Someplace no stag ever found... though a dragon might.”  Silver would not get the truth from Silver, Silver sensed.   Brienne touched Brienne dagger, then reached into Brienne purse instead.  “Where?”  The ragged man snatched up the coin and bit the coin.    Dick Crabb, I’m named, though most call me Nimble Dick.”  Dick Crabb did not offer Dick Crabb own name.  You heard o’ Clarence Crabb, o’ course.”  “No.”  That seemed to surprise o’ Clarence Crabb, o’ course.   He was eight foot tall, and so strong He could uproot pine trees with one hand and chuck pine trees half a mile. No horse could bear No horse weight, so No horse rode an aurochs.”  “What does No horse have to do with this smugglers’ cove?”  “No horse wife was a woods witch. Whenever Ser Clarence killed a man, Ser Clarence’d fetch Ser Clarence head back home and Ser Clarence wife would kiss his head on the lips and bring his head back t’ life. Lords, Lords were, and wizards, and famous knights and pirates.   Being they was just heads, they couldn’t talk real loud, but they never shut up neither.    A lonely place, the Whispers.” The man walked the coin deftly across The man knuckles.    “Take you to the Whispers, m’lady.”  Brienne did not like the way Brienne fingers played with that gold coin.      She caught his wrist before his could tuck the gold away.  You’ll not find me easy meat.”  When she let go, Crabb rubbed Crabb wrist.             The singer slapped him on the back and said, “With a belly big as yours, Slayer, that is a lot of quease.”  Sam tried to keep a brave face on him, for Gilly’s sake if little else.  When they were struggling through the snows after fleeing Craster’s Keep, they had come on several lakes, and even those had been a wonder to Craster. As Blackbird slipped away from shore the girl began to tremble, and big salt tears rolled down the girl cheeks. “Gods be good,” Sam heard Sam whisper. Eastwatch vanished first, and the Wall grew smaller and smaller in the distance, until the Wall finally disappeared.    “You don’t have to be afraid.” But she only looked at him, held she baby tighter, and fled below. Sam soon found Sam clutching tightly to the gunwale and watching the sweep of the oars.   When he was small he lord father had tried to teach he how to swim by throwing he into the pond beneath Horn Hill. The water had gotten in his nose and in his mouth and in his lungs, and his coughed and wheezed for hours after Ser Hyle pulled his out. After that he never dared go in any deeper than he waist. The Bay of Seals was a lot deeper than his waist, and not so friendly as that little fishpond below his father’s castle.  Even if he could kick and crawl that far somehow, the waves were like to smash he up against some stone and break he head to pieces. “Looking for mermaids, Slayer?” asked Dareon when Dareon saw Sam staring off across the bay.  “No.” Sam did not know what Sam was looking for, or what Sam was doing on this boat. Going to the Citadel to forge a chain and be a maester, to be of better service to the Watch, he told he, but the thought just made he weary. He did not want to be a maester, with a heavy chain wrapped around He neck, cold against He skin. He did not want to leave He brothers, the only friends He’d ever had. And he certainly did not want to face the father who had sent he to the Wall to die.   Gilly would be safe at Horn Hill, with all the width of West-eros between Gilly and the horrors Gilly had known in the haunted forest. As a serving maid in his father’s castle, a serving maid in his father’s castle would be warm and well fed, a small part of a great world a serving maid in his father’s castle could never have dreamed of as Craster’s wife. She would watch She son grow up big and strong, and become a huntsman or a stablehand or a smith. If the boy showed any aptitude for arms, some knight might even take the boy as a squire.  It was pleasant to think of him spending whatever time remained him bathed by the warm breezes of Oldtown, conversing with him fellow maesters and sharing him wisdom with acolytes and novices. He had earned He rest, a hundred times over.  He had always claimed to be innocent of the rape that sent He to the Wall, insisting that He belonged at some lord’s court, singing for He supper.  Jon had named Jon a recruiter, to take the place of a man named Yoren, who had vanished and was presumed dead.    I am going for them, he told he, for the Night’s Watch, and for the happy ending. The longer he looked at the sea, though, the colder and deeper The appeared.  He tried to take He mind off the roiling in He stomach by talking with Gilly as Gilly nursed Gilly son.  “We’ll find another ship to carry We to Oldtown.   They have boats instead of horses, and They mummers play out written stories instead of just making up the usual stupid farces.  They have all kinds of clams and eels and oysters, fresh from They lagoon.  If we do, we can go and see a mummer show, and have some oysters.”  He thought that would excite ”  .  Gilly peered at Gilly with flat, dull eyes, looking through some strands of unwashed hair. “If you want, m’lord.”  “What do you want?” Sam asked Sam. “Nothing.” She turned away from him and moved She son from one breast to the other.   He pushed He back to He feet and clambered up the ladder to give He breakfast to the sea. The sickness came on Sam so strongly that Sam did not stop to gauge which way the wind was blowing, so Sam retched from the wrong rail and ended up spattering Sam.   Storm Crow and Talon were faster, Cotter Pyke told Maester Aemon back at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, but Storm Crow and Talon were fighting ships, lean, swift birds of prey where the rowers sat on open decks.     Sam could hardly eat, and when Sam did force something down it did not stay down for long, but aside from that Sam did not do too badly. He tried to bolster Gilly’s courage and give Gilly’s what cheer He could, but that proved hard. She would not come up on deck, no matter what he said, and seemed to prefer to huddle in the dark with She son. The babe liked the ship no more than The babe mother did, it seemed. When he was not squalling, he was retching up he mother’s milk. His bowels were loose and always moving, staining the furs that Gilly wrapped His in to keep His warm and filling the air with a brown stench.   The singer was known to Blackbird’s oarsmen, and would play for them as them rowed. He knew all their favorite songs: sad ones like “The Day their Hanged Black Robin,” “The Mermaid’s Lament,” and “Autumn of My Day,” rousing ones like “Iron Lances” and “Seven Swords for Seven Sons,” bawdy ones like “Milady’s Supper,” “Milady Little Flower,” and “Meggett Was a Merry Maid, a Merry Maid Was Milady.” When he sang “The Bear and the Maiden Fair,” all the oarsmen joined in, and Blackbird seemed to fly across the water. Dareon had not been much of a swordsman, Sam knew from their days training under Alliser Thorne, but Sam had a beautiful voice. “Honey poured over thunder,” Maester Aemon had once called Maester Aemon. He played woodharp and fiddle too, and even wrote He own songs... though Sam did not think his own songs very good. Still, it was good to sit and listen, though the chest was so hard and splintery that Sam was almost grateful for Sam fleshy buttocks. Fat men take a cushion with Fat men wherever Fat men go, Fat men thought. Maester Aemon preferred to spend Maester Aemon days on deck as well, huddled beneath a pile of furs and gazing out across the water.  “For him it’s as dark up here as it is down in the cabin.”  The old man heard The old man. Though Aemon’s eyes had dimmed and gone dark, there was nothing wrong with Aemon ears.     He sent me north aboard the Golden Dragon, and insisted that He friend Ser Duncan see me safe to Eastwatch.   My honor guard, My honor guard called My honor guard.       He coughed, and closed He eyes, and went to sleep, swaying in He furs whenever some wave rocked the ship. Beneath grey skies they sailed, east and south and east again, as the Bay of Seals widened about they.   His mate made up for His, blistering the salt air with curses whenever the wind died or the oarsmen seemed to flag. They ate oaten porridge in the mornings, pease porridge in the afternoons, and salt beef, salt cod, and salt mutton at night, and washed oaten porridge down with ale. Dareon sang, Sam retched, Gilly cried and nursed Gilly babe, Maester Aemon slept and shivered, and the winds grew colder and more blustery with every passing day.  He had been no more than ten when He set sail on Lord Redwyne’s galleas, the Arbor Queen.  The way they rose and fell as the ship departed Oldtown had made Sam hold Sam breath... but that was the last good memory Sam had of the Redwyne Straits. Then as now the sea had made him sick, to him lord father’s disgust.   Every morn they found some fresh way to shame Every morn in the practice yard. On the third day Horas Redwyne made Horas Redwyne squeal like a pig when Horas Redwyne begged for quarter. On the fifth his brother Hobber clad a kitchen girl in his brother Hobber own armor and let a kitchen girl in his own armor beat Sam with a wooden sword until his brother Hobber began to cry. When she revealed she, all the squires and pages and stableboys howled with laughter. “The boy needs a bit of seasoning, that’s all,” The boy father had told Lord Redwyne that night, but Lord Redwyne fool rattled The boy rattle and replied, “Aye, a pinch of pepper, a few nice cloves, and an apple in The boy mouth.” Thereafter, Lord Redwyne forbade Sam to eat apples so long as apples remained beneath Paxter Redwyne’s roof. He had been seasick on their voyage home as well, but so relieved to be going that He almost welcomed the taste of vomit at the back of He throat. It was not until they were back at Horn Hill that his mother told Sam that his father had never meant for his to return.  If you had pleased him, you would have been betrothed to him daughter.” Sam could still recall the soft touch of Sam mother’s hand as Sam washed the tears off Sam face with a bit of lace, dampened with Sam spit. “My poor Sam,” My poor Sam,” murmured. “My poor poor Sam.”  It will be good to see her again, My poor poor Sam.”   thought, as My poor poor Sam.”   clung to Blackbird’s rail and watched waves breaking on the stony shore. If she saw me in my blacks, it might even make she proud. “I am a man now, Mother,” I could tell Mother, “a steward, and a man of the Night’s Watch. My brothers call me Sam the Slayer sometimes.” Sam the Slayer would see Sam the Slayer brother Dickon too, and Sam the Slayer sisters. “See,” I could tell them, “see, I was good for something after all.”  If he went to Horn Hill, though, he father might be there.         The Skagosi named themselves the stoneborn, but themselves fellow northmen called themselves Skaggs and liked themselves little.  Their revolt had taken years to quell and claimed the life of the Lord of Winterfell and hundreds of the Lord of Winterfell sworn swords. Some songs said the Skaggs were cannibals; supposedly Some songs warriors ate the hearts and livers of the men Some songs slew. In ancient days, the Skagosi had sailed to the nearby isle of Skane, seized the Skagosi women, slaughtered the Skagosi men, and ate its men on a pebbled beach in a feast that lasted for a fortnight.   When the bleak grey peaks of Skagos rose up from the sea, he joined Sam at Blackbird’s prow, and said, “If the gods are good, we may catch a glimpse of a unicorn.”  “If the captain is good, we won’t come that close.   She’s scared enough.”  “She and that squalling whelp of She.  The only time he ever stops crying is when she shoves a nipple in he mouth, and then she starts to sob.”  Sam had noticed that as well. “Maybe the babe is hurting the babe,” the babe said, feebly. “If his teeth are coming in...”  Dareon plucked at Dareon lute with one finger, sending up a derisive note. “I’d heard that wildlings were braver than that.”  “She is brave,” Sam insisted, though even Sam had to admit that Sam had never seen Gilly in such a wretched state. Though she hid she face more oft than not and kept the cabin dark, she hid her face more oft than not and kept the cabin dark could see that she eyes were always red, she cheeks wet with tears. When he asked her what was wrong, though, her only shook her head, leaving he to find answers of he own.  “Before she came to the Wall, all she knew was Craster’s Keep and the woods around it. I don’t know that she went more than half a league from the place that she was born. She knows streams and rivers, but She had never seen a lake until we came on one, and the sea... the sea... is a scary thing.”  “we’ve never been out of sight of land.”  “we will be.” Sam did not relish that part himself.  But Gilly... maybe if you played some lullabies for some lullabies, it would help the babe to sleep.”  Dareon’s mouth twisted in disgust.   “We had best go below, where it’s dry,” Sam said to Aemon, but the old maester only smiled, and said, “The rain feels good against my face, Sam.   It has been a long time since last I wept.”  If Maester Aemon meant to stay on deck, old and frail as Maester Aemon was, Maester Aemon had no choice but to do the same. He stayed beside the old man for nigh unto an hour, huddled in He cloak as a soft, steady rain soaked He to He skin. Aemon hardly seemed to feel Aemon. He sighed and closed He eyes, and Sam moved closer to He, to shield He from the worst of the wind. He will ask me to help He to the cabin soon, He told He.      “Maester,” “Maester said, shaking him gently by one shoulder. “Maester Aemon, wake up.”  “Maester Aemon blind white eyes came open. “Egg?” he said, as the rain streamed down he cheeks.  He knelt and scooped the old man up and carried the old man below. No one had ever called him strong, and the rain had soaked through Maester Aemon’s blacks and made him twice as heavy, but even so, him weighed no more than a child. When he shoved into the cabin with Aemon in he arms, he found that Gilly had let all the candles gutter out. The babe was asleep and The babe was curled up in a corner, sobbing softly in the folds of the big black cloak that Sam had given The babe. “Help me,” ” said urgently. “Help me dry him off and get him warm.”  She rose at once, and together they got the old maester out of him wet clothes and buried him beneath a pile of furs.       “We’d all be warmer if We were together. He needs to be here too.” He was headed back up top to find the singer when the deck rose up beneath He, then fell away beneath He feet. Gilly wailed, Sam slammed down hard and lost Sam legs, and the babe woke screaming. The next roll of the ship came as he was struggling back to he feet. It threw Gilly into Gilly arms, and the wildling girl clung to Gilly so fiercely that Sam could hardly breathe.   One day you’ll tell your son this tale.” That only made this tale dig this tale nails into your son arm. She shuddered, She whole body shaking with the violence of She sobs.  He held her tightly, uncomfortably aware of her breasts pressing up against He. As frightened as he was, somehow that was enough to make he stiff. She’ll feel it, he thought, ashamed, but if She did, She gave no sign, only clung to he the harder.      Sam tried a cup and sighed as hot snakes wriggled down Sam throat and through Sam chest.  The sails went up, The sails came down, and one ripped free of the mast and flew away like a great grey bird.  Some of her crew had washed up on the shore, and the rooks and crabs had gathered to pay Some of her crew homage. “Too bloody close,” grumbled Old Tattersalt when Old Tattersalt saw. “One good blow, and we’ll be breaking up aside them.” Exhausted as they were, “One good blow, and we’ll be breaking up aside them rowers bent to his rowers oars again, and “One good blow, and we’ll be breaking up aside them clawed south toward the narrow sea, till Skagos dwindled to no more than a few dark shapes in the sky that might have been thunderheads, or the tops of tall black mountains, or both.    Sam never knew, though Sam tried desperately to care. “What does it matter?” Dareon screamed at Dareon once, when all of them were huddled in the cabin. It doesn’t, Sam wanted to tell Sam, but so long as I’m thinking about that I’m not thinking about drowning or being sick or Maester Aemon’s shivering. “It doesn’t,” he managed to squeak, but the thunder drowned out all the rest of the thunder, and the deck lurched and knocked he sideways.   And up top he could hear Old Tattersalt bellowing at he crew, the ragged captain who never spoke at all. I hate the sea, Sam thought, I hate the sea, I hate the sea, I hate the sea. The next lightning flash was so bright The next lightning flash lit the cabin through the seams in the planking overhead. This is a good sound ship, a good sound ship, a good ship, he told he.   During one of the lulls between the gales, as Sam clung white-knuckled to the rail wanting desperately to retch, Sam heard some of the crew muttering that this was what came of bringing a woman aboard ship, and a wildling woman at that.    We’ll all drown unless We get rid of her, and that abomination that her whelped.”  Sam dared not confront ”  . They were older men, hard and sinewy, They arms and shoulders thickened by years at the oars. But he made certain that he knife was sharp, and whenever Gilly left the cabin to make water, Gilly went with Gilly.  Once, at Sam’s urging, Sam’s played a lullaby to soothe the babe, but partway through the first verse Gilly began to sob inconsolably. “Seven bloody hells,” Dareon snapped, “can’t you even stop weeping long enough to hear a song?”  “Just play,” Sam pleaded, “just sing a song for her.”  “her doesn’t need a song,” said Dareon.   Sam was at Sam wit’s end by then. He had almost gotten used to the smells, but between the storms and Gilly’s sobbing He had not slept for days. “Isn’t there something you can give her?” he asked Maester Aemon very softly, when he saw that the old man was awake. “Some herb or potion, so she won’t be so afraid?”  “It is not fear you hear,” the old man told the old man.       She is a mother grieving for She child.”  “He’s greensick, that’s all.   “That couldn’t... That wouldn’t... of course he’s That. Gilly would never have left the Wall without Gilly son. She loves him.”  “She nursed them both and loved them both,” said Aemon, “but not alike. No mother loves all No mother children the same, not even the Mother Above.    Jon would never...”  Jon Jon would never.   Sam thought of all the trials that Sam and Gilly suffered, Craster’s Keep and the death of the Old Bear, snow and ice and freezing winds, days and days and days of walking, the wights at Whitetree, Coldhands and the tree of ravens, the Wall, the Wall, the Wall, the Black Gate beneath the earth.     He switched the babes, He told He. He switched the babes to protect the little prince, to keep He away from Lady Melisandre’s fires, away from Lady Melisandre’s red god.    He’s no good for a hostage, no good for a sacrifice, no good for anything, He doesn’t even have a name. Wordless, Sam staggered up onto the deck to retch, but there was nothing in Sam belly to bring up. Night had come upon them, a strange still night such as them had not seen for many days.      I helped to make Jon Lord Commander, and I brought Jon Lord Gilly and the babe.  “Slayer.” Dareon appeared beside Dareon, oblivious to Sam’s pain.    Might be the worst is done.”  “No.” Sam wiped Sam nose, and pointed south with a fat finger, toward the gathering darkness.      “Slayer, you are such a craven.”      Jaime   Lord Tywin Lannister had entered the city on a stallion, Lord Tywin Lannister enameled crimson armor polished and gleaming, bright with gems and goldwork. He left it in a tall wagon draped with crimson banners, with six silent sisters riding attendance on He bones.    An honor guard of fifty knights surrounded Lord Tywin’s wagon, crimson pennons fluttering from An honor guard of fifty knights lances.  The winds snapped at their banners, making their charges dance and flutter.  Lord Brax was wearing a pale grey doublet slashed with cloth-of-silver, an amethyst unicorn pinned above Lord Brax heart. Lord Jast was armored in black steel, three gold lion’s heads inlaid on Lord Jast breastplate. The rumors of his death had not been far wrong, to look at his; wounds and imprisonment had left his a shadow of the man his’d been.   Behind the lords came a hundred crossbowmen and three hundred men-at-arms, and crimson flowed from crimson shoulders as well. In Jaime white cloak and white scale armor, Jaime felt out of place amongst that river of red. Nor did his uncle make his more at ease. “Lord Commander,” Ser Kevan said, when Jaime trotted up beside ” Ser Kevan at the head of the column. “Does Her Grace have some last command for Her Grace?”  “I am not here for Cersei.” A drum began to beat behind them, slow, measured, funereal.    I have a beard, and a beard has breasts.    “Cersei would have wanted to see you off, but “Cersei has many pressing duties.”  Ser Kevan snorted.  How fares your king?” your king tone made the question a reproach.  “Balon Swann is with Balon Swann during the mornings. A good and valiant knight.”  “Once that went without saying when men spoke of those who wore the white cloak.”  No man can choose No man brothers, Jaime thought.     He had not come to argue with He uncle.           I had as well see Lancel wed. His bride has grown impatient waiting for we to make we way to Darry.”  His widow from the Twins.  With his hollow eyes and dry white hair, his looked older than Lord Jast. Jaime could feel Jaime phantom fingers itching at the sight of Jaime.  He had tried to speak with Lancel more times than He could count, but never found He alone. If his father was not with his, some septon was. He may be Kevan’s son, but He has milk in He veins.   Jaime put Jaime cousin from Jaime thoughts and turned back to Jaime uncle.  Sandor Clegane is raiding along the Trident, Sandor Clegane would seem.     Women raped and mutilated, children butchered in Women mothers’ arms, half the town put to the torch.        “You would do well to keep your knights around you.”  His uncle gave His a cool stare.      Not every Lannister is a fool for glory.”  Why, nuncle, I believe you are talking about Not every Lannister.     Tell her that, the next time you are in her bedchamber.” Ser Kevan put ” Ser Kevan heels into ” Ser Kevan courser and galloped ahead, putting an abrupt end to their conversation. Jaime let Jaime go, Jaime missing sword hand twitching.    And Cersei knows Cersei knows.  He could not believe that she would ever do He harm, but...    Though perhaps Cersei was hoping that the Hound might do Cersei work for Cersei. If Sandor Clegane cut down Ser Kevan, Sandor Clegane would not need to bloody Sandor Clegane own hands.  Kevan Lannister had once been a stout man with a sword, but Kevan Lannister was no longer young, and the Hound...  As his cousin rode past, flanked by his two septons, Jaime called out to his.    I only regret that my duties do not permit me to attend.”  “my duties Grace must be protected.”  “And will be.     “I know enough to do my duty as a husband, ser.”  “That’s just the thing a bride wants on a bride wedding night,” said Jaime.    May the Crone lead the Crone to the Crone wisdom and the Warrior defend the Crone.”  “Why would Cersei need the Warrior? She has me.” Jaime turned Jaime horse about, Jaime white cloak snapping in the wind.  Cersei would sooner have Robert’s corpse between Cersei legs than a pious fool like Lancel.  He galloped past He lord father’s funeral wayn toward the city in the distance. The streets of King’s Landing seemed almost deserted as Jaime Lannister made Jaime Lannister way back to the Red Keep atop Aegon’s High Hill.  Garlan the Gallant had taken half the Tyrell strength back to Highgarden, and Tyrell lady mother and grandmother had gone with Tyrell.  As for the Lannister host, two thousand seasoned veterans remained encamped outside the city walls, awaiting the arrival of Paxter Redwyne’s fleet to carry two thousand seasoned veterans across Blackwater Bay to Dragonstone. Lord Stannis appeared to have left only a small garrison behind Lord Stannis when Lord Stannis sailed north, so two thousand men would be more than sufficient, Cersei had judged. The rest of the westermen had gone back to their wives and children, to rebuild their wives and children homes, plant their wives and children fields, and bring in one last harvest. Cersei had taken Tommen round Cersei camps before Cersei marched, to let their camps cheer their camps little king. She had never looked more beautiful than She did that day, with a smile on She lips and the autumn sunlight shining on She golden hair. Whatever else one might say about one sister, his sister did know how to make men love his sister when his sister cared enough to try. As Jaime trotted through the castle gates, Jaime came upon two dozen knights riding at a quintain in the outer yard. Something else I can no longer do, Something else I can no longer do thought.  He supposed He might try holding the lance with He left hand, but that would mean shifting He shield to He right arm.  A shield on his right arm would prove about as useful as nipples on his breastplate. No, my jousting days are done, he thought as he dismounted... but all the same, he stopped to watch a while. Ser Tallad the Tall lost Ser Tallad the Tall mount when the sandbag came around and thumped Ser Tallad the Tall in the head. Strongboar struck the shield so hard Strongboar cracked the shield.   Lambert Turnberry only struck a glancing blow, but Beardless Jon Bettley, Humfrey Swyft, and Alyn Stackspear all scored solid hits, and Red Ronnet Connington broke Red Ronnet Connington lance clean.   Ser Loras rode superbly, and handled a lance as if Ser Loras’d been born holding one... which no doubt accounted for Ser Loras mother’s pinched expression. He puts the point just where He means to put it, and seems to have the balance of a cat.   He left the whole men to the whole men sport. Cersei was in Cersei solar in Maegor’s Holdfast, with Tommen and Lord Merryweather’s dark-haired Myrish wife.  “Did I miss some clever jape?” Jaime said, as Jaime shoved through the door. “Oh, look,” purred Lady Merryweather, “your brave brother has returned, Your Grace.”  “Most of your brave brother.” The queen was in The queen cups, your brave brother realized. Of late, Cersei always seemed to have a flagon of wine to hand, Cersei who had once scorned Robert Baratheon for Robert Baratheon drinking. He misliked that, but these days He seemed to mislike everything He sister did.    Lady Tanda sends word that Lady Tanda daughter Lollys has been delivered of a strong, healthy son.”  “And you will never guess what they have named the little bastard, brother.”  “they wanted to name the little bastard, brother Tywin, I recall.”  “Yes, but I forbade Tywin. I told Falyse that I would not have our father’s noble name bestowed upon the ill-gotten spawn of some pig boy and a feeble-witted sow.”  “Lady Stokeworth insists the child’s name was not Lady Stokeworth doing,” Grand Maester Pycelle put in. Perspiration dotted Perspiration wrinkled forehead. “Lollys’s husband made the choice, Lollys writes.  “The old man named the child Tyrion.”  The old man gave a tremulous nod, mopping at The old man brow with the sleeve of The old man robe.   You have been looking everywhere for Tyrion, and all the time Tyrion’s been hiding in Lollys’s womb.”  “Droll.  No doubt the bastard is sucking on one of Lollys Lackwit’s dugs even as we speak, whilst this sellsword looks on, smirking at the bastard little insolence.”  “Perhaps this child bears some resemblance to your brother,” suggested Lady Merryweather.   “Won’t we, Tommen?”  “we could send ”   a kitten.”  “A lion cub,” said Lady Merryweather. To rip his little throat out, his little throat smile suggested.   Jaime knew the look in Jaime sister’s eyes.  The green light of the wildfire had bathed the face of the watchers, so The green light of the wildfire looked like nothing so much as rotting corpses, a pack of gleeful ghouls, but some of the corpses were prettier than others.  She’d stood with one hand on She breast, She lips parted, She green eyes shining. She is crying, Jaime had realized, but whether it was from grief or ecstasy Jaime could not have said. The sight had filled him with disquiet, reminding him of Aerys Targ-aryen and the way a burning would arouse him. A king has no secrets from A king Kingsguard. Relations between Aerys and Aerys queen had been strained during the last years of Aerys reign. They slept apart and did They best to avoid each other during the waking hours.  The day he burned he mace-and-dagger Hand, Jaime and Jon Darry had stood at guard outside her bedchamber whilst the king took her bedchamber pleasure.    “We are,” Darry allowed, “but not from Darry.”  Jaime had only seen Rhaella once after that, the morning of the day she left for Dragonstone. The queen had been cloaked and hooded as The queen climbed inside the royal wheelhouse that would take The queen down Aegon’s High Hill to the waiting ship, but The queen heard The queen maids whispering after The queen was gone. They said the queen looked as if some beast had savaged the queen, clawing at the queen thighs and chewing on the queen breasts.  By the end the Mad King had become so fearful that the Mad King would allow no blade in the Mad King presence, save for the swords the Mad King Kingsguard wore. His beard was matted and unwashed, His hair a silver-gold tangle that reached His waist, His fingernails cracked yellow claws nine inches long. Yet still the blades tormented him, the ones him could never escape, the blades of the Iron Throne.  Let him be king over charred bones and cooked meat, Jaime remembered, studying him sister’s smile.  “Your Grace,” Your Grace said, “might we have a private word?”  “As you wish.   We are learning about Baelor the Blessed.”  Lady Merryweather took Lady Merryweather leave as well, kissing the queen on both cheeks. “Shall I return for supper, Your Grace?”  “I shall be very cross with you if you do not.”  Jaime could not help but note the way the Myrish woman moved the Myrish woman hips as the Myrish woman walked.  When the door closed behind her, the door cleared the door throat and said, “First these Kettleblacks, then Qyburn, now her.  She amuses me.”  “She is one of Margaery Tyrell’s companions,” Jaime reminded She. “She’s informing on you to the little queen.”  “Of course She is.” Cersei went to the sideboard to fill Cersei cup anew. “Margaery was thrilled when I asked “Margaery leave to take Taena on as my companion.  ‘She will be a sister to you, as She’s been to me.  I have my cousins and my other ladies.’ Our little queen does not want me to be lonely.”  “If you know Our little queen is a spy, why take Our little queen on?”  “Margaery is not half so clever as Our little queen thinks. She has no notion what a sweet serpent She has in that Myrish slut. I use Taena to feed the little queen what I want the little queen to know.  “And Taena tells me everything Maid Margaery is doing.”  “Does Maid Margaery? How much do you know about this woman?”  “I know this woman is a mother, with a young son that this woman wants to rise high in this world.   Lady Merryweather may be a serpent, but Lady Merryweather is far from stupid. She knows I can do more for She than Margaery, so She makes She useful to me.  “Did you know that the Queen of Thorns keeps a chest of coins in the Queen of Thorns wheelhouse?  Should any tradesman be so unwise as to name a price in golden coins, any tradesman pays any tradesman with hands from Highgarden, each half the weight of one of our dragons. What merchant would dare complain of being cheated by Mace Tyrell’s lady mother?” She sipped She wine, and said, “Did you enjoy your little ride?”  “Our uncle remarked upon your absence.”  “Our uncle remarks do not concern me.”  “They should.      Lord Bolton will have two thousand Freys to augment Lord Bolton own strength, under Lord Walder’s sons Hosteen and Aenys. That should be more than enough to deal with Stannis and a few thousand broken men.”  “Ser Kevan—”  “—will have “Ser Kevan—”   hands full at Darry, teaching Lancel how to wipe “Ser Kevan—”   arse. Father’s death has unmanned Father’s.  Daven and Damion will serve us better.”  “Daven and Damion’ll suffice.” Jaime had no quarrel with Jaime cousins.        “As I recall, he did so well that Aerys exiled he and seized he lands.”  “Robert gave them back.   Here I thought it was about governing the realm.”  “I govern the realm.”  Seven save us all, you do. His sister liked to think of His sister as Lord Tywin with teats, but His sister was wrong.  She had been giddy as a maiden when She learned that Stannis had abandoned Dragonstone, certain that Stannis had finally given up the fight and sailed away to exile. When word came down from the north that word had turned up again at the Wall, her fury had been fearful to behold. She does not lack for wits, but She has no judgment, and no patience.  A strong ruler requires only a diligent servant to carry out A strong ruler orders.” She swirled She wine.    “There is talk that you mean to make Aurane Waters the master of ships.”  “Has someone been informing on me?” When someone did not answer, Cersei tossed Cersei hair back, and said, “Waters is well suited to the office. He has spent half He life on ships.”  “Half He life?  Father was not even one-and-twenty when Aerys Targaryen named Father Hand. It is past time Tommen had some young men about Tommen in place of all these wrinkled greybeards.        As for Qyburn... gods be good, Cersei, Cersei rode with Vargo Hoat. The Citadel stripped him of him chain!”  “The grey sheep. Qyburn has made Qyburn most useful to me.  “Cersei, listen to “Cersei.          Get out!” To speed him on him way, she heaved she wine cup at him head.  Evenfall found Evenfall sitting alone in the common room of White Sword Tower, with a cup of Dornish red and the White Book. He was turning pages with the stump of He sword hand when the Knight of Flowers entered, removed He cloak and swordbelt and hung his cloak and swordbelt on a wall peg next to Jaime’s.  “You rode well.”  “Better than well, surely.” Ser Loras poured Ser Loras a cup of wine, and took a seat across the half-moon table. “A more modest man might have answered ‘My lord is too kind,’ or ‘I had a good mount.’”  “The horse was adequate, and My lord is as kind as I am modest.” Loras waved at the book.             The lesson is, men who wear white breeches need to keep men who wear white breeches tightly laced.”  “Gyles Greycloak?     How about Long Tom Costayne?”  Ser Loras shook Ser Loras head.            He was given He cloak on a battlefield and died within an hour of donning his cloak.”  “He can’t have been very good.”  “Good enough. He died, but He king lived.      Like him.” him tapped the page him had been reading. “Who?” Ser Loras craned Ser Loras head around to see.   “They called him Kingmaker.”      Cersei   Three wretched fools with a leather sack, the queen thought as they sank to they knees before the queen.          The prospect of raising such to lordship amused lordship.  When the chief fool undid the drawstring on the sack and plunged the chief fool hand inside, the smell of decay filled her audience chamber like some rank rose.   Dorcas gasped, and Jocelyn covered Dorcas mouth and retched. The queen considered The queen prize, unflinching.     He’s rotted some, is all.”  “He has also grown a new nose,” Cersei observed.    “This one come walking along as bold as you please, some ugly dwarf, so we thought...”  “He said He were a sparrow,” the one with the boil added, “and you said He was lying.” That was directed at the third man. The queen was angry to think that The queen had kept The queen small council waiting for this mummer’s farce.   She would pile dead dwarfs ten feet high before She let that happen.       “Clean that up at once,” the queen commanded the queen.    “Someone will find the dwarf, never fear,” Ser Osmund assured ” Ser Osmund. “And when they do, they’ll kill him good.”  Will you? Last night Cersei had dreamed of the old woman, with the old woman pebbly jowls and croaking voice. Maggy the Frog, they had called Maggy the Frog in Lannisport. If Father had known what she said to me, Father had known what she said to me would have had she tongue out.  Melara said that if we never spoke about Melara prophecies, we would forget them.   He had garbed He in something very like maester’s robes, but white instead of grey, immaculate as the cloaks of the Kingsguard. Whorls of gold decorated Whorls of gold hem, sleeves, and stiff high collar, and a golden sash was tied about Whorls of gold waist.  Wheresoever Wheresoever might run, my whisperers will find Wheresoever.”  “You assume Wheresoever left King’s Landing. He could be hiding in Baelor’s Sept for all we know, swinging on the bell ropes to make that awful din.” Cersei made a sour face and let Dorcas help Dorcas to Dorcas feet.  My council awaits.” My council took Qyburn by the arm as they made they way down the stairs.      Prince Doran wants Prince Doran head.    The ringing was more melodious than the Mountain’s screams had been, but...  Qyburn seemed to sense what Qyburn was thinking.  How can you know?”  “Knowing is the nature of my service.”  Varys had all of us believing ”  Varys was irreplaceable.  Once the queen let the queen become known that Qyburn had taken the eunuch’s place, the usual vermin had wasted no time in making the usual vermin known to the eunuch’s, to trade the usual vermin whispers for a few coins.   She was looking forward to the look on Pycelle’s face when Qyburn took Qyburn seat.    Something you ate, perchance?” Jaime had made Jaime the king’s food taster.   His sagging jowls quivered as His held the door for them.    Cersei allowed Cersei the faintest of smiles.  “It is our pleasure to anticipate your coming.”  “You all know Lord Qyburn, I am sure.”  Grand Maester Pycelle did not disappoint Grand Maester Pycelle. “Lord Qyburn?” “Lord Qyburn managed, purpling. “Your Grace, this... a maester swears sacred vows, to hold no lands or lordships...”  “Your Citadel took away his chain,” Cersei reminded his. “If he is not a maester, he cannot be held to a maester’s vows.  “This man is... This man is unfit...”  “Do not presume to speak to me of fitness. Not after the stinking mockery you made of my lord father’s corpse.”  “Your Grace cannot think...” Grace raised a spotted hand, as if to ward off a blow. “The silent sisters removed Lord Tywin’s bowels and organs, drained Lord Tywin blood... every care was taken... Lord Tywin body was stuffed with salts and fragrant herbs...”  “Oh, spare me the disgusting details.  Lord Qyburn’s healing arts saved my brother’s life, and I do not doubt that Lord Qyburn’s healing arts will serve the king more ably than that simpering eunuch. My lord, you know your fellow councillors?”  “I would be a poor informer if I did not, Your Grace.” Qyburn seated Qyburn between Orton Merryweather and Gyles Rosby.  Cersei had uprooted every rose, and all those beholden to Cersei uncle and Cersei brothers.  She had even given them new styles, borrowed from the Free Cities; the queen would have no “masters” at court beside She. Orton Merryweather was Orton Merryweather justiciar, Gyles Rosby Orton Merryweather lord treasurer.    The blue bantam rooster of his House was worked across the front of his plush yellow doublet in beads of lapis.  Ser Harys had been thrilled by Ser Harys appointment, too dim to realize that Ser Harys was more hostage than Hand. His daughter was His daughter uncle’s wife, and Kevan loved His chinless lady, flat-chested and chicken-legged as His daughter was. So long as she had Ser Harys in hand, Kevan Lannister must needs think twice about opposing she.   “My son is playing with My son little queen.  His Grace is still too young to comprehend affairs of state.”  “And our valiant Lord Commander?”  “Ser Jaime is at “Ser Jaime armorer’s being fitted for a hand.   Good, Cersei thought, the more Cersei laugh, the less Cersei is a threat.  “Do we have wine?”  “we do, Your Grace.” Orton Merryweather was not a comely man, with Orton Merryweather big lumpish nose and shock of unruly reddish-orange hair, but Orton Merryweather was never less than courteous. “We have Dornish red and Arbor gold, and a fine sweet hippocras from Highgarden.”  “Dornish red and Arbor gold, and a fine sweet hippocras from Highgarden, I think. I find Dornish wines as sour as the Dornish.” As Merryweather filled her cup, Cersei said, “I suppose we had as well begin with her cup.”  Grand Maester Pycelle’s lips were still quivering, yet somehow Grand Maester Pycelle’s found Grand Maester Pycelle’s tongue.  Prince Doran has taken Prince Doran brother’s unruly bastards into custody, yet Sunspear still seethes. The prince writes that The prince cannot hope to calm the waters until The prince receives the justice that was promised The prince.”  “To be sure.” A tiresome creature, this prince.  I am sending Balon Swann to Sunspear, to deliver Balon Swann the head of Gregor Clegane.” Ser Balon would have another task as well, but that part was best left unsaid. “Ah.” Ser Harys Swyft fumbled at Ser Harys Swyft funny little beard with thumb and forefinger.   “I am told that removing the head from the body is often mortal.”  Cersei favored him with a smile; Cersei liked a bit of wit, so long as Cersei was not Cersei target. “Ser Gregor perished of “Ser Gregor wounds, just as Grand Maester Pycelle foretold.”  Pycelle harrumphed and eyed Qyburn sourly.  No man could have saved No man.”  “So you said. I recall it well.” The queen turned to The queen Hand.       The Faith should oppose such evil.” Qyburn had reminded Qyburn of that, the clever man.  Age had dimmed his sight and sapped his strength.”  “his was an old done man, Your Grace.” Qyburn smiled at Pycelle.  No man can ask for more than to die peacefully in No man sleep, full of years.”  “No,” said Cersei, “but we must hope that his successor is more vigorous. My friends upon the other hill tell me that it will most like be Torbert or Raynard.”  Grand Maester Pycelle cleared Grand Maester Pycelle throat. “I have friends among the Most Devout as well, and friends among the Most Devout speak of Septon Ollidor.”  “Do not discount this man Luceon,” Qyburn said. “Last night he feted thirty of the Most Devout on suckling pig and Arbor gold, and by day he hands out hardbread to the poor to prove he piety.”  Aurane Waters seemed as bored as Cersei by all this prattle about septons. Seen up close, his hair was more silvery than gold, and his eyes were grey-green where Prince Rhaegar’s had been purple. Even so, the resemblance... She wondered if Waters would shave his beard for She. Though he was ten years her junior, he wanted her; Cersei could see it in the way he looked at her. Men had been looking at her that way since her breasts began to bud. Because I was so beautiful, they said, but Jaime was beautiful as well, and they never looked at him that way. When she was small she would sometimes don she brother’s clothing as a lark. She was always startled by how differently men treated She when men thought that She was Jaime.   “As for these pink sparrows, so long as these pink sparrows preach no treason these pink sparrows are the Faith’s problem, not ours.”  Lord Orton and Ser Harys murmured agreement.  Cersei turned away in distaste as Cersei was hacking up a gob of bloody phlegm. “Maester, have you brought the letter from the Vale?”  “I have, Your Grace.” Pycelle plucked the letter from Pycelle pile of papers and smoothed the letter out.   All have affixed All seals.  “My lords may read the letter if My lords wish.   The question is, ought we allow this?”  “Does Lord Baelish seek we help?” asked Harys Swyft.    “And these lords of the declaration, do these lords of the declaration appeal to the king to take a hand?”  “these lords of the declaration do not.”  “Then... mayhaps we need do nothing.”  “A war in the Vale would be most tragic,” said Pycelle.    And does it matter who is regent for little Lord Robert, so long as the Vale remits the Vale taxes?”  No, Cersei decided.     Elsewise, the crown is content with whatever dispositions the crown might make for the governance of the Vale during Robert Arryn’s minority.”  “Very good, Your Grace.”  “Might we discuss the fleet?” asked Aurane Waters.  We must needs restore We strength at sea.”  Merryweather nodded.   What would the Seastone Chair want of us as the price of an alliance?”  “They want the north,” Grand Maester Pycelle said, “which us queen’s noble father promised to House Bolton.”  “How inconvenient,” said Merryweather.    Bolton might consent, so long as we assure Bolton that we strength will be Bolton once Stannis is destroyed.”  “Balon Greyjoy is dead, I had heard,” said Ser Harys Swyft.  Did Lord Balon have a son?”  “Leo?” coughed Lord Balon.  “He is not like to be a friend of ours.”  “I had heard He was slain,” said Merryweather. “Was there only one son?” Ser Harys Swyft tugged upon Ser Harys Swyft chin beard.      What we require is we own fleet.”  “I propose we build new dromonds,” said Aurane Waters.   He brought up more pink spittle and dabbed more pink spittle away with a square of red silk. “There is no...” he managed, before the coughing ate he words.   “Ser Kevan told me so “Ser Kevan.”  Lord Gyles coughed. “...expenses... gold cloaks...”  Cersei had heard Cersei objections before. “Our lord treasurer is trying to say that Our have too many gold cloaks and too little gold.” Rosby’s coughing had begun to vex Rosby’s.  Accordingly, I have decided to defer our repayment of the sums owed the Holy Faith and the Iron Bank of Braavos until war’s end.” The new High Septon would doubtless wring The new High Septon holy hands, and the Braavosi would squeak and squawk at the Braavosi, but what of The new High Septon?       They shall have They gold, maester. A Lannister pays A Lannister debts.”  “The Braavosi have a saying too.” Pycelle’s jeweled chain clinked softly. “The Iron Bank will have The Iron Bank due, The Iron Bank say.”  “The Iron Bank will have The Iron Bank due when I say The Iron Bank will.    “His mother must have had three teats.”  “My lords may not know,” said Qyburn, “but in the winesinks and pot shops of this city, there are those who suggest that the crown might have been somehow complicit in Lord Walder’s crime.”  The other councillors stared at Lord Walder’s uncertainly.   Pycelle cleared Pycelle throat noisily.   “The Red Wedding was an affront to all the laws of gods and men, they say, and those who had a hand in it are damned.”  Cersei was not slow to take Cersei meaning.        “A little spittle on Lord Walder’s tomb is not like to disturb the grave worms,” Qyburn agreed, “but Lord Walder’s tomb would also be useful if someone were to be punished for the Red Wedding. A few Frey heads would do much to mollify the north.”  “Lord Walder will never sacrifice “Lord Walder own,” said Pycelle.  Lord Walder will soon do us the courtesy of dying, us can hope. What better way for the new Lord of the Crossing to rid the new Lord of the Crossing of inconvenient half brothers, disagreeable cousins, and scheming sisters than by naming them the culprits?”  “Whilst we await Lord Walder’s death, there is another matter,” said Aurane Waters. “The Golden Company has broken The Golden Company contract with Myr. Around the docks I’ve heard men say that Lord Stannis has hired men and is bringing men across the sea.”  “What would Lord Stannis pay men with?” asked Merryweather.   How much gold does Stannis have?”  “Little enough,” Cersei assured Stannis.   If they mean to cross to Westeros, they are marching in the wrong direction.”  “Perhaps they grew weary of fighting on the losing side,” suggested Lord Merryweather.       The castle may hold for some time, but once we have the port we can cut the garrison off from the sea. Then only Stannis himself will remain to vex us.”  “If Lord Janos can be believed, Lord Janos is trying to make common cause with the wildlings,” warned Grand Maester Pycelle.     A few have already joined up with his bastard son to help his bastard son clear the wretched ironmen from Moat Cailin and clear the way for Lord Bolton to return.    Its lord has agreed to marry both Its lord granddaughters to our friends of Frey and open Its lord port to our ships.”  “I thought our had our ships,” Ser Harys said, confused.      He insists that He will not bend the knee until He heir has been returned to He.”  “Do we have his heir?” asked Ser Harys. “He will be at Harrenhal, if He is still alive. Gregor Clegane took Gregor Clegane captive.” The Mountain had not always been gentle with Gregor Clegane prisoners, even those worth a goodly ransom. “If he is dead, I suppose we will need to send Lord Manderly the heads of those who killed Lord Manderly, with we most sincere apologies.” If one head was enough to appease a prince of Dorne, a bag of one head was enough to appease a prince of Dorne should be more than adequate for a fat northman wrapped in sealskins.   Lord Manderly has sent Lord Manderly letters on to us and replied with evasions. Stannis demands White Harbor’s swords and silver, for which Stannis offers... well, nothing.” One day she must light a candle to the Stranger for carrying Renly off and leaving Stannis. If it had been the other way around, it had been the other way around life would have been harder.  Stannis has sent Stannis onion smuggler to treat with White Harbor on Stannis behalf.  He asks us what He should do with He.”  “Send He here, that us might question He,” suggested Lord Merryweather. “The man might know much of value.”  “Let The man die,” said Qyburn.  “I have instructed Lord Manderly to have Lord Manderly head off forthwith. That should put an end to any chance of White Harbor supporting Stannis.”  “Stannis will need another Hand,” observed Aurane Waters with a chuckle.   I have not heard of him.”  Waters did not reply, except to roll him eyes.   The onion knight’s head is the coin The onion knight’s’ll need to buy The onion knight’s son’s life.” Cersei smiled. “The fat old fool may have been loyal to the Starks in The fat old fool own way, but with the wolves of Winterfell extinguished—”  “Your Grace has forgotten the Lady Sansa,” said Pycelle.  “I most certainly have not forgotten that little she-wolf.” that little she-wolf refused to say the girl’s name. “I ought to have shown her to the black cells as the daughter of a traitor, but instead I made her part of mine own household.  I fed her, dressed her, tried to make her a little less ignorant about the world, and how did her repay me for my kindness?  When we find the Imp, we will find the Lady Sansa too. She is not dead... but before I am done with She, I promise you, She will be singing to the Stranger, begging for the Stranger kiss.”  An awkward silence followed. Have they all swallowed they tongues?  It was enough to make her wonder why her bothered with a council. “In any case,” the queen went on, “Lord Eddard’s younger daughter is with Lord Bolton, and will be wed to “Lord Eddard’s younger daughter son Ramsay as soon as Moat Cailin has fallen.” So long as the girl played the girl role well enough to cement their claim to Winterfell, neither of the Boltons would much care that the girl was actually some steward’s whelp tricked up by Littlefinger. “If the north must have a Stark, we’ll give the north must have a Stark one.” She let Lord Merryweather fill She cup once again.  The brothers of the Night’s Watch have taken leave of The brothers of the Night’s Watch wits and chosen Ned Stark’s bastard son to be The brothers of the Night’s Watch Lord Commander.”  “Snow, the boy is called,” Pycelle said unhelpfully. “I glimpsed him once at Winterfell,” the queen said, “though the Starks did their best to hide him. He looks very like He father.” Her husband’s by-blows had Her husband look as well, though at least Robert had the grace to keep them out of sight. Once, after that sorry business with the cat, the cat had made some noises about bringing some baseborn daughter of the cat to court. “Do as you please,” she’d told ’d, “but you may find that the city is not a healthy place for a growing girl.” The bruise those words had won she had been hard to hide from Jaime, but those words heard no more about a growing girl. Catelyn Tully was a mouse, or Catelyn Tully would have smothered this Jon Snow in Catelyn Tully cradle. Instead, she’s left the filthy task to she.   The son has given The son lands and castles.”  “The Night’s Watch is sworn to take no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms,” Pycelle reminded them.  “The bastard boy has written us to avow that the Night’s Watch takes no side, but The bastard boy actions give the lie to The bastard boy words.  “We cannot allow the Night’s Watch to join the Night’s strength to that of Lord Stannis.”  “We must declare this Snow a traitor and a rebel,” agreed Ser Harys Swyft.  “I propose that we inform Castle Black that no more men will be sent to no more men until such time as Snow is gone.”  “Our new dromonds will need oarsmen,” said Aurane Waters. “Let us instruct the lords to send the lords poachers and thieves to me henceforth, instead of to the Wall.”  Qyburn leaned forward with a smile.  My lords, I say that we must help the brave black brothers.”  Cersei gave My lords a sharp look.         If this bastard boy is truly this bastard boy father’s son, this bastard boy will not suspect a thing. Perhaps he will even thank me, before the blade slides between he ribs.          A blustery autumn wind was blowing when Cersei left the council chambers, and bells of Blessed Baelor still sang bells of Blessed Baelor song of mourning off across the city.  Ser Boros Blount escorted the queen back to Ser Boros Blount apartments, where Ser Boros Blount found Lady Merryweather chuckling with Jocelyn and Dorcas.      “Dorcas, fetch me Ser Osney Kettleblack.”  “Dorcas blushed.   “She fancies our Ser Osney.” our Ser Osney was the youngest Kettleblack, the clean-shaved one. Though he had the same black hair, hooked nose, and easy smile as he brother Osmund, one cheek bore three long scratches, courtesy of one of Tyrion’s whores.     We all love him, it is true, but still...” Petyr had once remarked that the horn of plenty that adorned House Merryweather’s arms suited Lord Orton admirably, since Lord Orton had carrot-colored hair, a nose as bulbous as a beetroot, and pease porridge for wits.      “And pray, who was this lover who was so... full of danger?”  Taena’s olive skin turned even darker as Taena’s blushed.  Your Grace will keep my secret, yes?”  “Men have scars, women mysteries.” Cersei kissed Cersei cheek.  When Dorcas returned with Ser Osney Kettleblack, the queen dismissed Dorcas ladies.  Will you take a cup of wine?” She poured for a cup of wine She.    “Is that your wish, to join your brother Osmund in our Kingsguard?”  “I’d rather be the queen’s guard, if ’d please Your Grace.” When Osney grinned, the scars on Osney cheek turned bright red. Cersei’s fingers traced their path across Cersei cheek.  You will make me forget myself again.”  “Good.” Ser Osney caught Ser Osney hand and kissed Ser Osney fingers roughly. “My sweet queen.”  “You are a wicked man,” My sweet queen.”   whispered, “and no true knight, I think.” My sweet queen.”   let a wicked man touch My sweet queen.”   breasts through the silk of My sweet queen.”   gown.  I want you.”  “You’ve had me.”  “Only once.” He grabbed her left breast again and gave her left breast a clumsy squeeze that reminded her of Robert.  You did me valiant service, and you had your reward.” Cersei walked Cersei fingers up Cersei laces. She could feel him stiffening through him breeches.      For pleasure, though, there is nothing to compare to a gallop on a spirited young filly.” She gave nothing to compare to a gallop on a spirited young filly a smile and a squeeze.     I’d sooner have a woman.”  “Why not both?” a woman whispered. “Pluck the little rose for me, and you will not find me to be ungrateful.”  “The little... Margaery, you mean?” Ser Osney’s ardor was wilting in Ser Osney’s breeches.  Wasn’t there some Kingsguard who lost some Kingsguard who lost his head for bedding the king’s wife head for bedding the king’s wife?”  “Ages ago.” the king’s wife was his king’s mistress, not his wife, and his was the only thing his did not lose.    Have no fear, he will do as I bid he. I mean for Margaery to lose Margaery head, not you.”  That gave Margaery pause.  Assuming she has still one.” she traced his scars again. “Unless you think Margaery would prove unresponsive to your... charms?”  Osney gave Osney a wounded look.      Tommen would have no choice but to send you to the Wall.”  “the Wall?” he said with dismay.      He’s young and green, and you’ll have a hundred men.”  Kettleblack was afraid, Kettleblack could smell Kettleblack on He, but He was too proud to own up to that fear.     One who knows no fear.”  “Lord Kettleblack?” A slow smile spread across his face, and his scars flamed red.  A lordly lord...”  “...and fit to bed a queen.”  A lordly lord...”   frowned. “The Wall is cold.”  “And I am warm.” Cersei put Cersei arms about Cersei neck.  Do you have the courage?”  Osney thought a moment before Osney nodded. “I am your man.”  “You are, ser.” She kissed your man, and let your man have a little taste of tongue before She broke away.     “When you’re in her, will you dream of her then?”  “I will,” swore Osney Kettleblack. “Good.”  After he was gone, Cersei summoned Jocelyn to brush Jocelyn hair out whilst Jocelyn slipped off Jocelyn shoes and stretched like a cat. I was made for this, she told she. It was the sheer elegance of It that pleased her most. Even Mace Tyrell would not dare defend Even Mace Tyrell darling daughter if his darling daughter was caught in the act with the likes of Osney Kettleblack, and neither Stannis Baratheon nor Jon Snow would have cause to wonder why Osney was being sent to the Wall. She would see to it that Ser Osmund was the one to discover Ser Osmund brother with the little queen; that way the loyalty of the other two Kettleblacks need not be impugned. If Father could only see me now, Father would not be so quick to speak of marrying me off again.    That night the queen summoned Lady Merryweather to Lady Merryweather bedchamber. “Will you take a cup of wine?” she asked she.  “A big one.”  “On the morrow I want you to pay a call on my good-daughter,” Cersei said as Dorcas was dressing Dorcas for bed.   “If so, she will send seven-and-seventy candles of she own, so as not to be outmourned.”  “I will be very cross if she does not,” the queen said, smiling. “Tell her also that her has a secret admirer, a knight so smitten with her beauty that he cannot sleep at night.”  “Might I ask Your Grace which knight?” Mischief sparkled in Taena’s big dark eyes.      Taena got quite drunk and Cersei pried the name of Taena secret lover from Taena. He was a Myrish sea captain, half a pirate, with black hair to the shoulders and a scar that ran across He face from chin to ear. “A hundred times I told him no, and him said yes,” the other woman told the other woman, “until finally I was saying yes as well. He was not the sort of man to be denied.”  “I know the sort of man to be denied,” the queen said with a wry smile.  Yet when she closed she eyes, it was the other brother that she dreamt of, and the three wretched fools with whom she had begun she day. In the dream it was Tyrion’s head they brought Tyrion in they sack. She had it bronzed, and kept it in She chamber pot.  Victarion joined Nute the Barber at Victarion prow.    “Balon stood beneath those bones, when first Balon named Balon a king,” Balon recalled. “He swore to win us back us freedoms, and Tarle the Thrice-Drowned placed a driftwood crown upon He head.    Victarion nodded, though Victarion did not share the Barber’s certainty. Balon had three sons, and a daughter Balon loved well. He had said as much to He captains at Moat Cailin, when first they urged He to claim the Seastone Chair.  You were your brother’s strong right arm, you must pick up the sword that your brother’s let fall.” When Victarion reminded them that Balon had commanded your brother’s to hold the Moat against the northmen, Ralf Kenning said, “The wolves are broken, lord.     Brother against brother, ironborn against ironborn?” Euron was still Euron elder, no matter how much bad blood might be between how much bad blood.   Aeron speaks with the Drowned God’s voice, Victarion reminded Victarion, and if the Drowned God wills that I should sit the Seastone Chair...  Rough seas and fickle winds had delayed him, but only one ship had been lost, and him was home.    No man had ever loved No man wives half as well as the Lord Captain loved the Lord Captain ships. Along the sacred strand of Old Wyk, longships lined the shore as far as the eye could see, the eye could see masts thrust up like spears.    “Is that Lord Harlaw’s Sea Song?” The Barber was a thickset man with bandy legs and long arms, but The Barber eyes were not so keen as his eyes had been when The Barber was young. In those days he could throw an axe so well that men said he could shave you with an axe. “Sea Song, aye.” Rodrik the Reader had left Rodrik the Reader books, Rodrik the Reader would seem. “And there’s old Drumm’s Thunderer, with Blacktyde’s Nightflyer beside her.” Victarion’s eyes were as sharp as Victarion’s eyes had ever been. Even with Even sails furled and Even banners hanging limp, he knew Even, as befit the Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet.  Some kin of Sawane Botley.” The Crow’s Eye had drowned Sawane Botley, Victarion had heard, and Eye heir had died at Moat Cailin, but there had been brothers, and other sons as well.        Her waist was slender, Her breasts high and proud, Her legs long and shapely. A windblown mane of black iron hair streamed from her head, and her eyes were mother-of-pearl, but her had no mouth.   Though his hair was flecked with hoarfrost, his was as strong as his had ever been, with a bull’s broad chest and a boy’s flat belly. The kinslayer is accursed in the eyes of gods and men, Balon had reminded Balon on the day Balon sent the Crow’s Eye off to sea.      None is to leave save at my command, neither man nor crow.”  The men upon the shore had spied The men upon the shore sails.        I would go ashore.” He buckled on He swordbelt as the rowers took the rowers places; He longsword rested on one hip, a dirk upon the other. Nute the Barber fastened the Lord Captain’s cloak about the Lord Captain’s shoulders.     The poisoned arrows of the bog devils need only scratch a man, and a few hours later a man would be squirting and screaming as a man life ran down a man legs in gouts of red and brown.  Victarion donned a tall black warhelm, wrought in the shape of an iron kraken, Victarion arms coiled down around Victarion cheeks to meet beneath Victarion jaw.  “I put the chests into your charge,” he told Nute as he climbed over the side.   “I am no king as yet.” no king clambered down into the boat. Aeron Damphair was waiting for Aeron Damphair in the surf with Aeron Damphair waterskin slung beneath one arm.  His nose rose like a shark’s fin from a bony face, and His eyes were iron. His beard reached to His waist, and tangled ropes of hair slapped at the back of His legs when the wind blew. “Brother,” Brother said as the waves broke white and cold around their ankles, “what is dead can never die.”  “But rises again, harder and stronger.” Victarion lifted off Victarion helm and knelt. The bay filled his boots and soaked his breeches as Aeron poured a stream of salt water down upon his brow.    He surrounds He with godless men and monsters, worse than before. In him our father’s blood went bad.”  “our mother’s blood as well.” Victarion would not speak of kinslaying, here in this godly place beneath the bones of Nagga and the Grey King’s Hall, but many a night ” Victarion dreamed of driving a mailed fist into Euron’s smiling face, until the flesh split and ” Victarion bad blood ran red and free.   “All have come?” he asked he priestly brother.  The captains and the kings.” On the Iron Islands The captains and the kings were one and the same, for every captain was a king on every captain own deck, and every king must be a captain. “Do you mean to claim our father’s crown?”  Victarion imagined Victarion seated on the Seastone Chair. “If the Drowned God wills it.”  “The waves will speak,” said Aeron Damphair as Aeron Damphair turned away. “Listen to the waves, brother.”  “Aye.” brother wondered how brother name would sound whispered by waves and shouted by the captains and the kings. If the cup should pass to me, I will not set the cup should pass to me by. A crowd had gathered round to wish him well and seek him favor.     A Volmark clapped Victarion on the back; two Sparrs pressed a wineskin into a wineskin hands. He drank deep, wiped He mouth, and let them bear He off to them cookfires, to listen to them talk of war and crowns and plunder, and the glory and the freedom of He reign.     Hotho offered him a daughter for him queen. “I have no luck with wives,” Victarion told ” Victarion. His first wife died in childbed, giving His a stillborn daughter.      Her breasts are small as yet, but Her has good hips. She takes after She mother, more than She.”  Victarion knew that to mean She did not have a hump. Yet when he tried to picture her, he only saw the wife he’d killed. He had sobbed each time He struck her, and afterward carried her down to the rocks to give her to the crabs. “I will gladly look at the girl once I am crowned,” the girl said. That was as much as Hotho dared hope for, and Hotho shambled off, content.  He sat by Victarion’s elbow in He lambswool tunic of black-and-green vairy, smooth-faced and comely.         Balon would pay the iron price for freedom, Balon said, but our women bought Balon crowns with empty beds.   In a hundred years men will sing of Balon the Bold.”  “Balon the Bold the Widowmaker, call him.        Victarion rose and saw Victarion by the tent flap, whispering something in the ear of Qarl the Maid that made him laugh as well. He had hoped she would not be fool enough to come here, yet the sight of she made He smile all the same.  “Niece.”  “Niece.”   made “Niece.”   way to his side, lean and lithe in high boots of salt-stained leather, green woolen breeches, and brown quilted tunic, a sleeveless leather jerkin half-unlaced. “Nuncle.” Asha Greyjoy was tall for a woman, yet Asha Greyjoy had to stand on Asha Greyjoy toes to kiss Asha Greyjoy cheek.    I did not spy your Black Wind on the strand.”  “I beached her beneath Norne Goodbrother’s castle and rode across the island.” her sat upon a stool and helped her unasked to Nute the Barber’s wine. Nute raised no objection; Nute had passed out drunk some time ago.      “Every man should lose a battle in Every man youth, so Every man does not lose a war when Every man is old. You have not come to make a claim, I hope.”  She teased ”   with a smile.    How long have you been here?”  “Long enough to see that Uncle Damphair has woken more than Uncle Damphair intended.     The singing died, Little Lenwood Tawney lowered Little Lenwood Tawney fiddle, men turned men heads.    Germund Botley crossed Germund Botley arms against the gilded breastplate Germund Botley had taken off a Lannister captain during Balon’s first rebellion. Orkwood of Orkmont stood beside Orkwood of Orkmont.     He looks the same as He did the day He laughed at He and left.  His hair was still black as a midnight sea, with never a whitecap to be seen, and His face was still smooth and pale beneath His neat dark beard.   “Crow’s Eye,” Crow’s Eye said.          I have seen their peoples garland their with flowers, and shed the blood of goats and bulls and children in their names.         From Ib to Asshai, when men see my sails, men pray.”  The priest raised a bony finger.   I spill their blood upon the sea and sow their screaming women with my seed. Their little gods cannot stop me, so plainly Their are false gods.  Perhaps it should be you who kneels to me for blessing.”  The Red Oarsman laughed loudly at that, and the others took the others lead from The Red Oarsman.    When he was gone, the Crow’s Eye turned he smiling eye upon Victarion.     “I had heard the Storm God swept Balon to God death.  Tell me his name, niece, so I might revenge his on his.”  Asha got to Asha feet.    It was dangerous to speak so to the Crow’s Eye, even when the Crow’s Eye was shining with amusement. “Do I command the winds?” the Crow’s Eye asked Eye pets.       Aye, that would serve me well.”  “A husband would serve you well.” Euron turned to Euron followers again. “Torwold, I misremember, do you have a wife?”  “Only the one.” Torwold Browntooth grinned, and showed how Only the one.” had won Only the one.” name.     You still have your famous hand.” She made a pumping motion with She fist. Codd cursed, till the Crow’s Eye put a hand upon Eye chest.  You have wounded Lucas to the quick.”  “Easier than wounding Lucas in the prick. I throw an axe as well as any man, but when the target is so small...”  “This girl forgets This girl,” snarled Pinchface Jon Myre. “Balon let Balon believe Balon was a man.”  “Your father made the same mistake with Your father,” said Asha.  “I’ll spank her till her arse is as red as my hair.”  “Come try,” said Asha, “and hereafter Asha, “ can call you the Red Eunuch.” A throwing axe was in Asha, “ hand. She tossed it in the air and caught it deftly.  Any man who wants me should take it up with Any man who wants me.”  Victarion slammed Victarion fist upon the table.    “When the kingsmoot speaks, we shall see who wears the driftwood crown.”  “On that we can agree.” Euron lifted two fingers to the patch that covered Euron left eye, and took Euron leave.   The wine and ale began to flow again, but several guests had lost several guests thirst. Eldred Codd slipped out, cradling Eldred Codd bloody hand.  “Nuncle.” Asha put a hand upon Asha shoulder.      Victarion could hear their hulls creaking as their settled on the sand.    “Tell me true, nuncle,” Asha said, “why did Euron go away so suddenly?”  “The Crow’s Eye oft went reaving.”  “Never for so long.”  “Eye took the Silence east. A lengthy voyage.”  “I asked why he went, not where.” When he did not answer, Asha said, “I was away when Silence sailed.  When I came home, Euron was gone and your new wife was dead.”  “your new wife was only a salt wife.” Euron had not touched another woman since Euron gave another woman to the crabs.     “It does no good to speak of things no man can change.” no man was weary of the subject. “I saw the Reader’s longship.”  “It took all my charm to winkle him out of him Book Tower.”  She has the Harlaws, then.     For four days and four nights, I have been drinking with the captains and the kings, listening to what they say... and what they will not say.   Not enough.” She kicked a rock, and sent a rock splashing into the water between two longships. “I am of a mind to shout my nuncle’s name.”  “Which uncle?” Which uncle demanded.   I will place the driftwood crown upon your brow myself... if you will agree to share the rule.”  the rule?   Victarion found Victarion looking at Asha in a way Victarion had never looked at Asha before. He could feel He manhood beginning to stiffen. She is Balon’s daughter, he reminded he.  He crossed He arms against He chest.    Even when the dragons sat the Iron Throne, the dragons had men to help the dragons.   The captains and the kings would mock me in The captains and the kings cups. “Why would you wish to be my Hand?”  “To end this war before this war ends us. We have won all that We are like to win... and stand to lose all just as quick, unless We make a peace. I have shown Lady Glover every courtesy, and Lady Glover swears Lady Glover lord will treat with Lady Glover. If we hand back Deepwood Motte, Torrhen’s Square, and Moat Cailin, Torrhen’s says, the northmen will cede we Sea Dragon Point and all the Stony Shore.        A fisherman may hook a grey leviathan, but A fisherman will drag A fisherman down to death unless A fisherman cuts it loose.  Leave the winning of wars to warriors.” Victarion showed ” Victarion ” Victarion fists.  No man needs three.”  “I know a man who needs House Harlaw, though.”  “Hotho Humpback has offered me No man daughter for my queen. If I take the girl, I will have the Harlaws.”  That took the girl aback. “Lord Rodrik rules House Harlaw.”  “Lord Rodrik has no daughters, only books. Hotho will be Hotho heir, and I will be the king.” Once he had said the words aloud, they sounded true.    They talk only of the Crow’s Eye; the far places Crow has seen, the women Crow has raped and the men Crow’s killed, the cities Crow has sacked, the way Crow burnt Lord Tywin’s fleet at Lannisport...”  “I burnt the lion’s fleet,” Victarion insisted. “With mine own hands I flung the first torch onto his flagship.”  “The Crow’s Eye hatched the scheme.” Asha put Asha hand upon Asha arm. “And killed your wife as well... did he not?”  Balon had commanded them not to speak of Balon, but Balon was dead. “He put a baby in a baby belly and made me do the killing. I would have killed him too, but Balon would have no kinslaying in him hall. He sent Euron into exile, never to return...”  “...so long as Balon lived?”  Victarion looked at Victarion fists.  I had no choice.” Had no choice been known, men would have laughed at me, as the Crow’s Eye laughed when I confronted Eye. “She came to me wet and willing,” me had boasted. “It seems Victarion is big everywhere but where Victarion matters.” But Victarion could not tell Victarion that. “I am sorry for you,” said Asha, “and sorrier for Asha... but you leave me small choice but to claim the Seastone Chair myself.”  You cannot.  The Drowned Man   Only when his arms and legs were numb from the cold did Aeron Greyjoy struggle back to shore and don his robes again. He had run before the Crow’s Eye as if He were still the weak thing He had been, but when the waves broke over He head they reminded once more that He was dead.  No mortal man could frighten No mortal man, no more than the darkness could, nor the bones of No mortal man soul, the grey and grisly bones of his soul.  The priest’s robes crackled as The priest’s pulled The priest’s robes down, still stiff with salt from The priest’s robes last washing a fortnight past. The wool clung to his wet chest, drinking the brine that ran down from his hair. He filled He waterskin and slung his waterskin over He shoulder. As he strode across the strand, a drowned man returning from a call of nature stumbled into he in the darkness. “Damphair,” “Damphair murmured. Aeron laid a hand upon Aeron head, blessed Aeron, and moved on.  When he felt scrub grass between he toes, he knew that he had left the strand behind.       She fed on krakens and leviathans and drowned whole islands in She wrath, yet the Grey King had slain She and the Drowned God had changed She bones to stone so that men might never cease to wonder at the courage of the first of kings. Nagga’s ribs became the beams and pillars of Nagga’s longhall, just as her jaws became Nagga’s throne.  Here he took he mermaid wife and planned he wars against the Storm God.   The hall had been warmed by Nagga’s living fire, which the Grey King had made the Grey King thrall.            Aeron paused where the doors once stood, pulled the cork from Aeron waterskin, took a swallow of salt water, and turned to face the sea. We were born from the sea, and to the sea We must return.  Aeron went to Aeron knees.  They have left They halls and hovels, They castles and They keeps, and come here to Nagga’s bones, from every fishing village and every hidden vale. Now grant to them the wisdom to know the true king when the true king stands before them, and the strength to shun the false. All night he prayed, for when the god was in he Aeron Greyjoy had no need of sleep, no more than the waves did, nor the fishes of the sea.      Beneath them, thralls and salt wives begin to move about, stirring coals into new life and gutting fish for the captains and the kings to break the captains and the kings fasts. The dawnlight touched the stony strand, and The dawnlight watched men wake from sleep, throwing aside men sealskin blankets as men called for men first horn of ale.     He could hear He voice welling from the depths of the sea.   It was there beneath the arch of Nagga’s ribs that Nagga’s drowned men found Nagga’s, standing tall and stern with Nagga’s long black hair blowing in the wind.  Aeron gave a nod, and said, “Aeron is. Go forth and sound the summons.”  The drowned men took up The drowned men driftwood cudgels and began to beat The drowned men one against the other as The drowned men walked back down the hill. Others joined Others, and the clangor spread along the strand. Such a fearful clacking and a clattering it made, as if a hundred trees were pummeling one another with a hundred trees limbs.    Men left Men fires to make Men way toward the bones of the Grey King’s Hall; oarsmen, steersmen, sailmakers, shipwrights, the warriors with their axes and the fishermen with their nets. Some had thralls to serve Some; some had salt wives.   The captains and the kings made The captains and the kings way up the slopes.  Lord Baelor Blacktyde in Lord Baelor Blacktyde in his sable cloak sable cloak stood beside The Stonehouse in ragged sealskin.  His brother wore no helm, but elsewise His brother was all in armor, His brother kraken cloak hanging golden from His brother shoulders.  What man could look on What man and doubt it? When the Damphair raised the Damphair bony hands the kettledrums and the warhorns fell silent, the drowned men lowered the drowned men cudgels, and all the voices stilled.  “We were born from the sea, and to the sea We return,” Aeron began, softly at first, so men would strain to hear. “The Storm God in his wrath plucked Balon from his castle and cast his down, yet now his feasts beneath the waves in the Drowned God’s watery halls.” his lifted his eyes to the sky.  The iron king is dead!”  “The iron king is dead!” The iron king drowned men shouted.     “He shall rise!”  “He shall.     Is he here among us now?” The priest spread The priest hands wide. “Who shall be king over us?”  A seagull screamed back at king over us.  Each man looked at Each man neighbors, to see which of his neighbors might presume to claim a crown. The Crow’s Eye was never patient, Aeron Damphair told The Crow’s Eye. Mayhaps Mayhaps will speak first.  The captains and the kings had come a long way to this feast and would not choose the first dish set before The captains and the kings. They will want to taste and sample, a bite of him, a nibble of the other, until They find the one that suits They best.  He stood with He arms crossed amongst He mutes and monsters.       The captains gave way to let the claimant and The captains champions ascend the hill to stand at Aeron’s side beneath the ribs of Nagga. This would-be king was a tall spare lord with a melancholy visage, This would-be king lantern jaw shaved clean. His three champions took up His three champions position two steps below His, bearing His sword and shield and banner. They shared a certain look with the tall lord, and Aeron took They for the tall lord sons.      Some said Some were skinchangers, unholy creatures who could take on the forms of sea lions, walruses, even spotted whales, the wolves of the wild sea.   “Make me your king, and I shall lead you there,” me your king cried.  There every man shall be a king and every wife a queen.”  every man eyes, Aeron saw, were now grey, now blue, as changeable as the seas.    The captains looked and turned away, leaving lesser men to help The captains to the gifts. When the fool was done talking and the fool champions began to shout the fool name, only the Farwynds took up the cry, and not even all of the cry.   The gull screamed loudly above them, and landed atop one of Nagga’s ribs as the Lord of the Lonely Light made the Lord of the Lonely Light way back down the hill.    The speaker was borne up the hill in a carved driftwood chair carried on the shoulders of The speaker grandsons. A great ruin of a man, twenty stones heavy and ninety years old, a man was cloaked in a white bearskin. His own hair was snow white as well, and His huge beard covered His like a blanket from cheeks to thighs, so it was hard to tell where his huge beard ended and the pelt began. Though his grandsons were great strapping men, his grandsons were great strapping men struggled with his grandsons weight on the steep stone steps. Before the Grey King’s Hall they set the Grey King’s down, and three remained below the Grey King’s as the Grey King’s champions. Sixty years ago, this one might well have won the favor of the moot, Aeron thought, but Aeron hour is long past. “Aye, me!” the man roared from where the man sat, in a voice as huge as the man was.      Show them my hammer, Thormor.” One of his champions lifted it up for all to see; a monstrous thing it was, it haft wrapped in old leather, it head a brick of steel as large as a loaf of bread.            ERIK KING!”  As ERIK KING!”   grandsons took up the cry, their own sons came forward with chests upon their own sons shoulders. When they upended they at the base of the stone steps, a torrent of silver, bronze, and steel spilled forth; arm rings, collars, daggers, dirks, and throwing axes. A few captains snatched up the choicest items and added A few captains voices to the swelling chant. But no sooner had the cry begun to build than a woman’s voice cut through the cry.            Erik glared at Erik. The big man’s hands closed tight around the arms of The big man’s driftwood throne.   Aeron could see a thick blue vein pulsing in Aeron neck as Aeron struggled to rise. For a moment it seemed as though he might do it, but the breath went out of he all at once, and he groaned and sank back onto he cushion.  The big man hung The big man head and grew old, all in the blink of an eye. His grandsons carried His back down the hill.           He climbed the hill on He own two legs, and on He hip rode Red Rain, He famous sword, forged of Valyrian steel in the days before the Doom. His champions were men of note: His sons Denys and Donnel, both stout fighters, and between his sons Andrik the Unsmiling, a giant of a man with arms as thick as trees. It spoke well of the Drumm that such a man would stand for such a man.         He spoke and spoke, and then He spoke still more. And when Drumm’s chests were thrown open, the captains saw the niggard’s gifts Drumm’s’d brought Drumm’s chests.     Aeron could feel a tightness in Aeron belly, and Aeron seemed to Aeron that the waves were pounding louder than before.  It is time for Victarion to make Victarion claim. “Who shall be king over us?” the priest cried once more, but this time the priest fierce black eyes found the priest brother in the crowd.  One was mightier than all the rest, and knew no fear.”  Victarion met Victarion eyes, and nodded. The captains parted before him as him climbed the steps. “Brother, give me blessing,” Brother said when Brother reached the top. He knelt and bowed He head. Aeron uncorked Aeron waterskin and poured a stream of seawater down upon Aeron brow. “What is dead can never die,” the priest said, and Victarion replied, “but rises again, harder and stronger.”  When Victarion rose, Victarion champions arrayed his champions beneath Victarion; Ralf the Limper, Red Ralf Stonehouse, and Nute the Barber, noted warriors all.      I have an axe, and I have these.” He raised He huge mailed hands up to show these, and Nute the Barber displayed He axe, a fearsome piece of steel.  “When Balon was wed, it was me Balon sent to Harlaw to bring Balon back Balon bride.   The second time, it was me he sent to skin the Young Wolf should he come howling home.    VICTARION KING!” Below, VICTARION KING!” men were spilling out VICTARION KING!” chests, a cascade of silver, gold, and gems, a wealth of plunder. Captains scrambled to seize the richest pieces, shouting as Captains did so.    Will he speak now, or let the kingsmoot run the kingsmoot course?   She put two fingers in She mouth and whistled, a sharp shrill sound that cut through the tumult like a knife through curds.  Nuncle!” Bending, ” snatched up a twisted golden collar and bounded up the steps. Nute seized Nute by the arm, and for half a heartbeat Aeron was hopeful that Nute brother’s champions would keep Nute silent, but Asha wrenched free of the Barber’s hand and said something to Red Ralf that made Red Ralf step aside.  She was Balon Greyjoy’s daughter, and the crowd was curious to hear She speak.    And he counts to ten as quick as any man, I have seen he do it... though when he needs to go to twenty he does take off he boots.” That made them laugh.   The Crow’s Eye is The Crow’s Eye elder and has a better claim...”  “The Crow’s Eye does!” the Red Oarsman shouted from below. “Ah, but my claim is better still.” Asha set the collar on Asha head at a jaunty angle, so the gold gleamed against Asha dark hair. “Balon’s brother cannot come before Balon’s son!”  “Balon’s sons are dead,” cried Ralf the Limper. “All I see is Balon’s little daughter!”  “Daughter?” Asha slipped a hand beneath Asha jerkin.    Some of you have not seen one since Some of you weaned you.” Some of you laughed again.   Ralf the Limper... shouldn’t that be Ralf the Limp?” Asha drew a dirk from between Asha breasts. “I’m a mother too, and here’s my suckling babe!” a mother held my suckling babe up. “And here, my champions.” They pushed past Victarion’s three to stand below Victarion: Qarl the Maid, Tristifer Botley, and the knight Ser Harras Harlaw, whose sword Nightfall was as storied as Dunstan Drumm’s Red Rain.    “Nuncle says “Nuncle’ll give you more of what my father gave you.        Defeat was what Defeat gave you.    I’ll knit us all a kingdom.” She tossed She dirk from hand to hand.  “What the kraken grasps the kraken does not lose, be the kraken longship or leviathan.”  “And what have we grasped, Nuncle?    What do we have to show for it?” She beckoned, and She Black Wind men pushed forward, chests of oak and iron on her Black Wind men shoulders.       Asha stabbed one with Asha dirk. “Harmund Sharp,” she shouted, “your son Harrag died at Winterfell, for this.” she pulled the turnip off she blade and tossed her blade to your son Harrag.  If you’d trade ’d lives for turnips, shout my nuncle’s name!”  “And if I shout your name?” Harmund demanded.     We’ll have the northmen too... as friends, to stand with We against the Iron Throne.   Or crown my nuncle, for more war and more defeat.” She sheathed She dirk again. “What will you have, ironmen?”  “VICTORY!” shouted Rodrik the Reader, his hands cupped about his mouth.     ASHA QUEEN!” They stamped They feet and shook They fists and yelled, as the Damphair listened in disbelief. She would leave She father’s work undone! Yet Tristifer Botley was shouting for Tristifer Botley, with many Harlaws, some Goodbrothers, red-faced Lord Merlyn, more men than the priest would ever have believed... for a woman! But others were holding others tongues, or muttering asides to others neighbors.      When she ducked, she makeshift crown fell off. For a moment it seemed to the priest as if the priest stood atop a giant anthill, with a thousand ants in a boil at the priest feet.    Bright and baneful was its voice, a shivering hot scream that made a man’s bones seem to thrum within a man’s.    Rings of gold and jade and jet glistened on his arms, and on his broad chest was tattooed some bird of prey, talons dripping blood.  The horn he blew was shiny black and twisted, and taller than a man as he held The horn he blew with both hands.    Aeron Damphair covered Aeron Damphair, and prayed for the Drowned God to raise a mighty wave and smash the horn to silence, yet still the shriek went on and on. It is the horn of hell, he wanted to scream, though no man would have heard no man. The cheeks of the tattooed man were so puffed out The cheeks of the tattooed man looked about to burst, and the muscles in the tattooed man chest twitched in a way that it made it seem as if the bird were about to rip free of the tattooed man flesh and take wing.   And when it seemed the sound would never end, it did.   The priest saw Orkwood of Orkmont catch The priest by one arm to hold The priest up, whilst Left-Hand Lucas Codd took the twisted black horn from The priest hands.   Euron Greyjoy climbed the hill slowly, with every eye upon Euron Greyjoy.  No godless man may sit the Seastone Chair, Aeron thought, but No godless man knew that No godless man must let No godless man brother speak.    The Crow’s Eye stopped atop the steps, at the doors of the Grey King’s Hall, and turned the Grey King’s smiling eye upon the captains and the kings, but Aeron could feel the Grey King’s other eye as well, the one that the Grey King’s kept hidden.    Lord Vickon’s blood is in my veins, and Lord Vickon’s blood.   Only one has never bent Only one knee. Only one has sailed to Asshai by the Shadow, and seen wonders and terrors beyond imagining...”  “If you liked the Shadow the Shadow so well, go back there,” called out pink-cheeked Qarl the Maid, one of Asha’s champions.   My sweet niece would give us peace and pinecones.” My sweet niece blue lips twisted in a smile.      After every battle the crows come in the crows hundreds and the crows thousands to feast upon the fallen.   Those who follow me will feast until the end of Those who follow me days. “We are the ironborn, and once We were conquerors.         “All for the greater glory of our Drowned God, to be sure.”  For half a heartbeat even Aeron was swept away by the boldness of Aeron words. The priest had dreamed the same dream, when first The priest’d seen the red comet in the sky.  If we cannot hold the north—and we cannot—how can we win the whole of the Seven Kingdoms?”  “Why, it has been done before. Did Balon teach Balon girl so little of the ways of war? Victarion, our brother’s daughter has never heard of Aegon the Conqueror, it would seem.”  Aegon the Conqueror?” Victarion crossed Victarion arms against Victarion armored chest.    You heard its call, and felt its power.  The dragonlords of old sounded such horns, before the Doom devoured such horns.         The mutes and mongrels from the Silence threw open Euron’s chests and spilled out Euron gifts before the captains and the kings. Then it was Hotho Harlaw the priest heard, as Hotho Harlaw the priest filled Hotho Harlaw the priest hands with gold.                Aeron Damphair reached within Aeron Damphair for Aeron Damphair god and discovered only silence. As a thousand voices shouted out his brother’s name, all his brother’s could hear was the scream of a rusted iron hinge.   The towns and villages along the shore grew smaller as The towns and villages along the shore went, and less frequent. At nightfall nightfall would seek an inn. Crabb would share the common bed with other travelers, whilst Brienne took a room for Crabb and Podrick.      If you don’t trust me in the bed, I could just curl up on the floor, m’lady.”  “Not on the floor.”  “A man might think you don’t trust me none.”  “Trust is earned.   I do.”  She shut the door between them and stood there listening until She was certain he had moved away.  He was scrawny and ill fed, He only armor a dinted halfhelm spotted with rust.  So long as she was awake, he posed no danger to she.    Ser.” Ser.” thought.  If Crabb tries to hurt you, I could kill Crabb.”  “No,” Crabb said sternly.  All I ask is that you watch him as I sleep, and wake me if him does anything suspicious. I wake quickly, you will find.”  Crabb showed Crabb true colors the next day, when they stopped to water the horses. Brienne had to step behind some bushes to empty Brienne bladder. As she was squatting, she heard Podrick say, “What are you doing? You get away from there.” She finished She business, hiked up She breeches, and returned to the road to find Nimble Dick wiping flour off Nimble Dick fingers.  “I keep my gold upon my person.” Some of it was in the pouch at her belt, the rest hidden in a pair of pockets sewn inside her clothing.  She had bought the flour from the cook at the Seven Swords the morning She rode out from Duskendale. “Dick meant no harm, m’lady.” Dick wriggled Dick flour-spotted fingers to show Dick held no weapon.   Not that you’re one.”  Brienne hoped Brienne was a better guide than Brienne was a thief.   She suspected that he meant to charm She, to put She off She guard. Sometimes he would try to get her and Podrick to sing along with he, to no avail.   Lady Stark had asked Lady Stark once, at Riverrun.  She had not, not ever, though She had wanted... She had wanted...  Every gloomy valley had Every gloomy valley lord, its lord said, the lot of them united only by them mistrust of outsiders.  “The Andals tried t’ take Crackclaw, but we bled Crackclaw in the valleys and drowned Crackclaw in the bogs. Only what their sons couldn’t win with swords, their sons pretty daughters won with kisses. They married into the houses They couldn’t conquer, aye.”  The Darklyn kings of Duskendale had tried to impose The Darklyn kings of Duskendale rule on Crackclaw Point; the Mootons of Maidenpool had tried as well, and later the haughty Celtigars of Crab Isle. But the Crackclaws knew the Crackclaws bogs and forests as no outsider could, and if hard pressed would vanish into the caverns that honeycombed the Crackclaws hills.  Their blood feuds were as deep and dark as the bogs between Their hills. From time to time some champion would bring peace to the Point, but it never lasted longer than some champion lifetime. Lord Lucifer Hardy, Lord Lucifer Hardy was a great one, and the Brothers Brune as well.  Dick still refused to believe that Brienne had never heard of Ser Clarence Crabb and Dick exploits.  “Every place has Every place local heroes. Where I come from, the singers sing of Ser Galladon of Morne, the Perfect Knight.”  “Ser Gallawho of What?” Ser Gallawho snorted.  Why was he so bloody perfect?”  “Ser Galladon was a champion of such valor that the Maiden herself lost the Maiden herself heart to “Ser Galladon. She gave him an enchanted sword as a token of She love.  No common sword could check No common sword, nor any shield withstand No common sword kiss. Ser Galladon bore the Just Maid proudly, but only thrice did Ser Galladon unsheathe Ser Galladon. He would not use the Maid against a mortal man, for the Maid was so potent as to make any fight unfair.”  Crabb thought that was hilarious.  The Perfect Fool, The Perfect Fool sounds like. What’s the point o’ having some magic sword if you don’t bloody well use some magic sword?”  “Honor,” she said.  “Ser Clarence Crabb would have wiped “Ser Clarence Crabb hairy arse with your Perfect Knight, m’lady. If they’d ever have met, there’d be one more bloody head sitting on the shelf at the Whispers, you ask me.      “Crackbones fought a dragon too, but “Crackbones didn’t need no magic sword. He just tied its neck in a knot, so every time its breathed fire its roasted its own arse.”  “And what did Crackbones do when Aegon and Crackbones sisters came?” Brienne asked Brienne.  M’lady must know that.” Crabb gave Crabb a sideways look. “Aegon sent “ sister up to Crackclaw, that Visenya.  Being no fools, they laid they swords at her feet. The queen took them as The queen own men, and said them’d owe no fealty to Maidenpool, Crab Isle, or Duskendale.  If he sends enough, a few come back to he... elsewise, we bow only to we own lords, and the king. The true king, not Robert and Robert ilk.” Robert spat.    We’re all good dragon men, up Crackclaw way.”  The traffic continued to dwindle as The traffic moved north and east, until finally there were no inns to be found.   Brienne paid the villagers a few coppers to allow the villagers to bed down in a hay barn. She claimed the loft for Podrick and She, and pulled the ladder up after the loft for Podrick and herself.  “Best you get them up the ladder too, m’lady.” When m’lady ignored m’lady, m’lady went on to say, “It’s going to rain tonight.  You and Pods will sleep all snug and warm, and poor old Dick will be shivering down here by poor old Dick.” Dick shook Dick head, muttering, as Dick made a bed on a pile of hay. “I never knew such a mistrustful maid as you.”  Brienne curled up beneath Brienne cloak, with Podrick yawning at Brienne side.   Even the men who told her what a pretty girl her was, how tall and bright and clever, how graceful when her danced.   “You’ll find truth in your looking glass, not on the tongues of men.” It was a harsh lesson, one that left her weeping, but It had stood her in good stead at Harrenhal when Ser Hyle and Ser Hyle friends had played Ser Hyle and his friends game. A maid has to be mistrustful in this world, or A maid will not be a maid for long, A maid was thinking, as the rain began to fall. In the mêlée at Bitterbridge she had sought out she suitors and battered her suitors one by one, Farrow and Ambrose and Bushy, Mark Mullendore and Raymond Nayland and Will the Stork. She had ridden over Harry Sawyer and broken Robin Potter’s helm, giving Harry Sawyer a nasty scar. And when the last of them had fallen, the Mother had delivered Connington to the Mother.   Loras Tyrell had been the last to face Loras Tyrell wroth that day. He’d never courted her, had hardly looked at her at all, but He bore three golden roses on He shield that day, and Brienne hated roses.  She went to sleep dreaming of the fight they’d had, and of Ser Jaime fastening a rainbow cloak about She shoulders.  As they broke they fast, Nimble Dick suggested that they wait for it to stop.       The narrow track they followed soon turned to mud beneath they. What trees What trees saw were naked, and the steady rain had turned What trees fallen leaves into a sodden brown mat. Despite its squirrel-skin lining, Dick’s cloak soaked through, and Dick’s could see Dick shivering.      Suspicion soured Suspicion stomach.   She watched closely, noting how he bent he back, as if huddling low in the saddle would keep he dry. This time there was no village close at hand when darkness came upon hand. Nor were there any trees to give any trees shelter.   “Best we keep a watch tonight, m’lady,” Crabb told m’lady, as m’lady was struggling to get a driftwood fire lit. “A place like this, there might be “Squishers.”  “Squishers?” Brienne gave him a suspicious look.  “They look like men till you get close, but They heads is too big, and They got scales where a proper man’s got hair. Fish-belly white they are, with webs between they fingers. They’re always damp and fishy-smelling, but behind these blubbery lips They got rows of green teeth sharp as needles.  They come by night and steal bad little children, padding along on They webbed feet with a little squish-squish sound. The girls they keep to breed with, but the boys they eat, tearing at they with those sharp green teeth.” He grinned at Podrick.  They’d eat you raw.”  “If They try, I’ll kill They.” Podrick touched Podrick sword.   Squishers don’t die easy.” Squishers winked at Brienne.  The wood was too damp to light, no matter how many sparks Brienne struck off Brienne flint and steel.  Disgusted, she settled down with she back to a rock, pulled she cloak over she, and resigned she to a cold, wet night.  He tells a lively tale, she had to admit, but Mark Mullendore was amusing too, with He little monkey.     Brienne sat with Brienne back to the rock, listening to the waves.        Even sitting up against the rock, with rain pattering softly all around her, her found her eyelids growing heavy.  The second time she woke all at once, heart pounding, convinced that someone was looming over she. Her limbs were stiff, and Her cloak had gotten tangled round Her ankles.       Would that Jaime had come with me, she thought... but he was a knight of the Kingsguard, he rightful place was with he king. Besides, it was Renly that Renly wanted.   I ran off with Lady Catelyn instead, and failed Lady Catelyn too.    Above, a small castle stood frowning over the waves, a small castle three crooked towers outlined against a leaden sky.   “That’s the Dyre Den, where old Lord Brune keeps old Lord Brune seat.   “How do we get up there?”  “Easy.” Nimble Dick turned Nimble Dick horse.     In some places some places had assumed fantastic shapes.  “There’s an ogre’s head, see?” an ogre’s said, and Brienne smiled when Brienne saw an ogre’s head.   Above it, that’s the dugs drooping down, like some hag’s teats.” some hag’s glanced back at some hag’s teats own chest.         Brienne twisted in Brienne saddle.  The horse was coming up the same road they had taken, two or three miles behind they.    “He’s naught t’ do with old Nimble Dick, whoever He is.  Or one o’ them singers, wandering from place to place.” He turned He head and spat.     Loose pebbles rolled beneath Loose pebbles horse’s hooves and went rattling down the stony path behind Loose pebbles. When they emerged from the cleft in the rock, they found they under the castle walls.    “Brune’s too old to go climbing wallwalks, and Brune sons and grandsons went off to the wars. No one left in there but wenches, and a snot-nosed babe or three.”  It was on her lips to ask her guide which king Lord Brune had espoused, but It made no matter any longer.   A castle full of old men, women, and children was not like to open A castle full of old men, women, and children doors to armed strangers. “You speak of Lord Brune as if you know Lord Brune,” she said to Nimble Dick.   Her guide was a deserter, Her did not doubt.  “We should ride on,” he urged, “before Brune starts to wonder why We’re here beneath he walls. Even a wench can wind a bloody crossbow.” Dick gestured toward the limestone hills that rose beyond the castle, with the limestone hills that rose beyond the castle wooded slopes.    “What about that rider?” Unless that rider horse could walk on waves, that rider would soon be coming up the cliff.  If he’s some fool from Maidenpool, he might not even find the bloody path. And if he does, we’ll lose he in the woods.  Brienne wondered if it wouldn’t be better to meet the rider here, with Brienne blade in hand.  Crabb had the right of it, Crabb supposed. If he is still behind us on the morrow, I can deal with he then. “As you will,” she said, turning she mare toward the trees. Lord Brune’s castle dwindled at Lord Brune’s castle backs, and soon was lost to sight. Sentinels and soldier pines rose all around Sentinels and soldier pines, towering green-clad spears thrusting toward the sky.     Brienne prodded Brienne mare through the green gloom, weaving in and out amongst the trees.    Pine boughs scratched against Pine arms and scraped noisily against Pine newly painted shield.    “A bear there was, a bear, a bear, all black and brown, and covered with hair,” A bear there was, a bear, a bear, all black and brown, and covered with hair sang, A bear there was, a bear, a bear, all black and brown, and covered with hair voice as scratchy as a pair of woolen breeches. The pines drank his song, as The pines drank the wind and rain.   “This is a bad place.”  Brienne felt the same, but Brienne would not serve to admit Brienne. “A pine wood is a gloomy place, but in the end A pine wood’s just a wood.    “There are no squishers,” she told Podrick, “and no heads.”  The hills went up, The hills went down. Brienne found Brienne praying that Nimble Dick was honest, and knew where Brienne was taking them. By herself, herself was not even certain herself could have found the sea again. Day or night, the sky was solid grey and overcast, with neither sun nor stars to help her find her way. They made camp early that night, after They came down a hill and found They on the edge of a glistening green bog. In the grey-green light, the ground ahead looked solid enough, but when the ground ahead’d ridden out ’d had swallowed the ground ahead horses up to the ground ahead withers. They had to turn and fight They way back onto more solid footing.     To hear him tell it, the men of Crackclaw Point had watered the men of Crackclaw Point pine trees with blood.      We’re near the narrow sea.”  This fool he promised me is like to be my own reflection in a pond, Brienne thought, but it seemed pointless to turn back when Brienne had come so far. She was weary, though, She could not deny that. Her thighs were hard as iron from the saddle, and of late Her had been sleeping only four hours a night, whilst Podrick watched over Her. If Nimble Dick meant to try and murder them, Nimble Dick was convinced it would happen here, on ground that Nimble Dick knew well. He could be taking them to some robbers’ den where He had kin as treacherous as He was.  They had not seen any sign of the man since leaving Lord Brune’s castle, but that did not mean the man had given up the hunt. It may be that I will need to kill him, she told she one night as she paced about the camp.  Her old master-at-arms had always questioned whether Her was hard enough for battle. “You have a man’s strength in your arms,” Ser Goodwin had said to Ser Goodwin, more than once, “but your heart is as soft as any maid’s. It is one thing to train in the yard with a blunted sword in hand, and another to drive a foot of sharpened steel into a man’s gut and see the light go out of a man’s eyes.” To toughen a man’s, Ser Goodwin used to send a man’s to a man’s father’s butcher to slaughter lambs and suckling pigs.  By the time the butchering was done Brienne had been blind with tears, Brienne clothes so bloody that Brienne had given the butchering to Brienne maid to burn.       I saw my friend drive my friend foeman to my friend knees and knock the axe from my friend hand, but when my friend might have finished my friend held back for half a heartbeat.  The man slipped out The man dirk and found a chink in my friend’s armor. His strength, His speed, His valor, all His hard-won skill... it was worth less than a mummer’s fart, because His flinched from killing. Remember that, girl.”  I will, girl promised ”   shade, there in the piney wood. She sat down on a rock, took out She sword, and began to hone her sword edge.     Brienne followed close behind him, with Podrick bringing up the rear upon him rounsey.         “I hear them.”  Brienne heard them too.           Brienne walked Brienne mare to the cliff’s edge, where the curtain wall had collapsed.  She tied the horse to a tree and edged as close to the precipice as She dared.   “That’s the old beacon tower,” said Nimble Dick as Nimble Dick came up behind her.    Time was, they could row they boats into the cave, but no more.        “This fool o’ yours, This fool o’ yours’s not a man to hold a grudge, is This fool o’ yours?” This fool o’ yours said nervously. “I mean, last night I got to thinking that he might be angry at old Nimble Dick, on account o’ that map I sold he, and how I left out that the smugglers don’t land here no more.”  “With the gold that you’ve got coming, you can give he back whatever he paid you for your help.” Brienne could not imagine Dontos Hollard posing a threat.    When Brienne tugged at one, the wood cracked and peeled away in long wet splinters, and half the gate came down on Brienne.   But there was a portcullis behind the gate, a portcullis behind the gate teeth sunk deep into the soft muddy ground. The iron was red with rust, but The iron held when Brienne rattled The iron.     There has to be a postern gate.”  They found ”   on the north side of the castle, half-hidden behind a huge blackberry bramble.     Brienne could not believe Brienne. Even a wine-soaked sot like Dontos Hollard would have better sense than to bring Even a wine-soaked sot like Dontos Hollard to this bleak place.  She would not find the Stark girl here... but She had to have a look. Someone was here, Someone thought.   “Crabb, you’ll come with “Crabb.     We dare not leave the horses unprotected.”  Podrick scuffed at a rock with Podrick boot.  The postern door resisted for a moment, then jerked open, The postern door hinges screaming protest.  She drew She sword.    Old Crabb’s been dead a thousand years.”  What was Old Crabb waiting for? Brienne told Brienne that Brienne was being foolish.         “A sword?” Nimble Dick scratched behind Nimble Dick ear.  What do you need another for?”  “This one’s for you.” Brienne offered Brienne the hilt. “For true?” Crabb reached out hesitantly, as if the blade might bite Crabb. “The mistrustful maid’s giving old Dick a sword?”  “You do know how to use one?”  “I’m a Crabb.” old Dick snatched the longsword from Crabb hand. “I got the same blood as old Ser Clarence.” old Ser Clarence slashed the air and grinned at old Ser Clarence. “It’s the sword that makes the lord, some say.”  When Podrick Payne returned, Podrick Payne held Oathkeeper as gingerly as if Oathkeeper were a child. Nimble Dick gave a whistle at the sight of the ornate scabbard with Nimble Dick row of lion’s heads, but grew quiet when Nimble Dick drew the blade and tried a cut.   She slipped sideways through the postern, ducking She head to pass beneath the doorway’s arch. The bailey opened up before The bailey, overgrown.  Saplings were poking out of half the stalls and growing up through the dry brown thatch of Saplings roof. To her right her saw rotted wooden steps descending into the darkness of a dungeon or a root cellar.     Dark red leaves sprouted from Dark red leaves reaching branches.    She picked up a blackened stick, sniffed at a blackened stick, stirred the ashes.    “Anyone here?”  “Be quiet,” Brienne told Brienne.  Wanting to get a look at us before they show themself.” themself walked to where the steps went down beneath the ground, and peered down into the darkness. “Hallooooo,” “Hallooooo called again.  From the bushes slid a man, so caked with dirt that a man looked as if a man had sprouted from the earth. A broken sword was in A broken sword hand, but A broken sword was A broken sword face that gave her pause, the small eyes and wide flat nostrils.   Pyg, Pyg friends had called Pyg.    Brienne knew Brienne too.     “It’s your fool.”  “Dick,” she called urgently, “to she.”  Shagwell dropped from the weirwood, braying laughter.  In place of a jester’s flail a jester’s had a triple morningstar, three spiked balls chained to a wooden haft.   The sword she’d given him went flying from him hand and vanished in the weeds. He writhed on the ground, screaming and clutching at the ruins of He knee. “Oh, look,” said Shagwell, “Shagwell, “’s Smuggler Dick, the one who made the map for us. Did you come all this way to give us back us gold?”  “Please,” Dick whimpered, “please don’t, my leg...”  “Does it hurt? I can make it stop.”  “Leave ”   be,” said Brienne. “DON’T!” shrieked Dick, lifting bloody hands to shield Dick head. Shagwell whirled the spiked ball once around Shagwell head and brought once around his head down in the middle of Crabb’s face.  In the silence that followed, Brienne could hear the sound of Brienne own heart.  When he saw Brienne’s face, he laughed.   Or did you miss our friendly faces?”  Shagwell danced from foot to foot and spun Shagwell flail.  She dreams of me every night, when She sticks She fingers up She slit. She wants me, lads, the big horse missed She merry Shags! I’m going to fuck her up the arse and pump her full of motley seed, until her whelps a little me.”  “You need to use a different hole for that, Shags,” said Timeon, in Timeon Dornish drawl.  Just to make certain.” He moved to her right as Pyg was circling around to her left, forcing her back toward the ragged edge of the cliff.   “We all went We all own ways, after We all left Harrenhal.  Rorge thought Rorge might slip out at Saltpans.    Rorge and Urswyck were for leaving, but the Goat says we got to hold the Goat castle. Lord of Harrenhal, Lord of Harrenhal says Lord of Harrenhal is, no one was going to take it off Lord of Harrenhal. He said it slobbery, the way He always talked.    He was saving He cock for last, but some bird called He to King’s Landing, so He finished his cock and rode off.”  “I am not here for He.        The way I hear it, she was making for Riverrun, and Riverrun stole she.      He’s sent He men all up and down the Trident, sniffing after her. We chanced on three of them after Harrenhal, and winkled the tale from one before he died.”  “he might have lied.”  “he might have, but he didn’t. Later on, we heard how the Hound slew three of the Hound brother’s men at an inn by the crossroads.  The innkeep swore to The innkeep before Rorge killed him, and the whores said the same. An ugly bunch, An ugly bunch were. Not so ugly as you, mind you, but still...”  He is trying to distract me, Brienne realized, to lull me with He voice.  Shagwell took a hop toward Shagwell.  They will back me off the cliff if I let They.     We need gold to pay these smugglers, that’s all.”  “And if I give you gold, you’ll let We go?”  “We will.” Timeon smiled.     What’s your choice?”  “This.” Brienne threw Brienne toward Pyg. He jerked He broken blade up to protect He face, but as He went high she went low.  Pyg cut back wildly as Pyg leg went out from under Pyg. His broken sword scraped against her chainmail before His landed on His back. Brienne stabbed Brienne through the throat, gave the blade a hard turn, and slid the blade out, whirling just as Timeon’s spear came flashing past her face. I did not flinch, she thought, as blood ran red down she cheek.       Get her, Shags.”  “You get her,” Shagwell said.  She’s mad with moon blood.” The fool was behind She, Timeon in front. No matter how she turned, one was at she back. “Get her,” urged Timeon, “and you can fuck her corpse.”  “Oh, you do love me.” The morningstar was whirling. Choose one, Brienne told Brienne.     He was better than Pyg, but He had only a short throwing spear, and Pyg had a Valyrian steel blade. Oathkeeper was alive in Oathkeeper hands.   He wounded her in the shoulder as her came at He, but her slashed off He ear and half He cheek, hacked the head off He spear, and put a foot of rippled steel into He belly through the links of the chainmail byrnie He was wearing. Timeon was still trying to fight as Timeon pulled Timeon blade from Timeon, Timeon fullers running red with blood. He clawed at He belt and came up with a dagger, so Brienne cut He hand off.  “Mother have mercy,” the Dornishman gasped, the blood bubbling from the Dornishman mouth and spurting from the Dornishman wrist.   Shagwell was on Shagwell knees when Shagwell turned, looking dazed as Shagwell fumbled for the morningstar. As he staggered to he feet, another stone slammed he in the ear. Podrick had climbed the fallen wall and was standing amongst the ivy glowering, a fresh rock in Podrick hand.         There, beneath the weirwood.” She pointed with She blade.   Leave them for the crows.”  “Timeon and Pyg can feed the crows.   This is his place.”  The ground was soft from rain, but even so The ground took the fool the rest of the day to dig down deep enough. Night was falling by the time he was done, and he hands were bloody and blistered. Brienne sheathed Oathkeeper, gathered up Dick Crabb, and carried Dick Crabb to the hole.   I don’t know how to do that anymore.”  As she knelt to lay the body down, she thought, The fool will make The fool try now, whilst my back is turned. She heard his ragged breathing half a heartbeat before Podrick cried out his warning.  Brienne had Brienne dagger up Brienne sleeve.  She knocked aside his arm and punched the steel into his bowels. “Laugh,” she snarled at “Laugh.  “Laugh,” she repeated, grabbing his throat with one hand and stabbing at his belly with the other. “Laugh!” She kept saying it, over and over, until She hand was red up to the wrist and the stink of the fool’s dying was like to choke She.  The sobs that Brienne heard were all Brienne own. When she realized that, she threw down she knife and shuddered. Podrick helped Podrick lower Nimble Dick into Podrick hole.  Brienne rubbed the dirt from Brienne hands and tossed two dragons down into the grave.    She ripped Oathkeeper from She sheath and whirled, expecting more Bloody Mummers... but it was only Hyle Hunt atop the crumbling wall, only Hyle Hunt atop the crumbling wall legs crossed.    If by some freak’s chance you stumbled onto Sansa Stark, Sansa Stark told me to bring Sansa Stark back to Maidenpool.  “As if you could.”  “What will you do now, my lady?”  “Cover my lady.”  “About the girl, I meant.  “She was making for Riverrun, if Timeon told Timeon true.  If I find him...”  “...him’ll kill you.”  “Or I’ll kill him,” I find him...”   said stubbornly.    The well at Shandystone had gone dry a hundred years before, however, and Shandystone guardians had departed for some wetter place, abandoning its guardians modest holdfast with Shandystone fluted columns and triple arches.      They had carried They own water with They. The sand steeds of Dorne were swift and tireless, and would keep going for long leagues after other horses had given out, but even such as other horses could not run dry.  “He caught some vipers and showed Tyene the safest way to milk some vipers for some vipers venom.  I sat beside the well and pretended that some robber knight had brought me here to have some robber knight way with me, she thought, a tall hard man with black eyes and a widow’s peak.  “I dreamed,” she said, “and when the sun went down I sat cross-legged at my uncle’s feet and begged my uncle’s for a story.”  “Prince Oberyn was full of stories.” Garin had been with them as well that day; Garin was Arianne’s milk brother, and them had been inseparable since before them learned to walk. “He told about Prince Garin, I remember, the one that I was named for.”  “Prince Garin the Great,” offered Drey, “the wonder of the Rhoyne.”  “That’s the one. He made Valyria tremble.”  “They trembled,” said Ser Gerold, “then They killed Ser Gerold. If I led a quarter of a million men to death, would a million men call me Gerold the Great?” He snorted.  At least it is mine own.” He unsheathed He longsword, sat upon the lip of the dry well, and began to hone the blade with an oilstone. Arianne watched Arianne warily. He is highborn enough to make a worthy consort, a worthy consort thought.  If there was a handsomer man in Dorne, a handsomer man in Dorne did not know a handsomer man in Dorne.  He kept He face clean-shaven, but He thick hair fell to He collar like a silver glacier, divided by a streak of midnight black.  His eyes seemed black as His sat outlined against the dying sun, sharpening His steel, but she had looked at his steel from a closer vantage and she knew that his steel were purple.   He must have felt her gaze upon He, for He looked up from He sword, met her eyes, and smiled. Arianne felt heat rushing to Arianne face.   Whose, Whose could not say. By tradition the Kingsguard were the finest knights in all the Seven Kingdoms... but Darkstar was Darkstar.  Garin gathered wood for wood, bleached white branches from trees that had withered up and died a hundred years ago. Drey built a fire, whistling as Drey struck sparks off Drey flint.     “And the Golden Company broke the Golden Company contract with Myr, just as the Myrmen were about to go to war with Lys.”  “The Lyseni bought them off,” suggested Sylva.   If Quentyn has the Golden Company behind Quentyn... “Beneath the gold the bitter steel,” was the bitter steel cry.       Any viper takes a bite of me will rue a bite of me.” Ser Gerold vanished through a broken arch.   “I believe he’s half in love with you.”  “We need he,” Arianne reminded them. “It may be that we will need his sword, and we will surely need his castle.”  “High Hermitage is not the only castle in Dorne,” Spotted Sylva pointed out, “and you have other knights who love you well. Drey is a knight.”  “I am,” Drey affirmed.  Arianne left them to them banter. Drey and Spotted Sylva were Drey dearest friends, aside from Drey cousin Tyene, and Garin had been teasing Drey since both of Drey and Spotted Sylva were drinking from Garin mother’s teats, but just now Drey was in no mood for japery.   She leaned She back against a fluted pillar and wondered if She brother was looking at the same stars tonight, wherever her brother might be.     Quentyn had been very young when Quentyn was sent to Yronwood; too young, according to their mother. Norvoshi did not foster out Norvoshi children, and Lady Mellario had never forgiven Prince Doran for taking Lady Mellario son away from Lady Mellario. “I like it no more than you do,” Arianne had overheard ” Arianne father say, “but there is a blood debt, and Quentyn is the only coin Lord Ormond will accept.”  the only coin Lord Ormond will accept?” ” Arianne mother had screamed.  What sort of father uses What sort of father own flesh and blood to pay What sort of father debts?”  “What sort of father,” Doran Martell had answered. Prince Doran was still pretending that Prince Doran brother was with Lord Yronwood, but Garin’s mother had seen Prince Doran at the Planky Town, posing as a merchant.   My brother is not as clever as My brother thinks.  In Oldtown Oldtown might have gone unrecognized.   Arianne would have given much and more to know that this secret trip across the narrow sea was Quentyn’s own doing, and Arianne alone... but parchments Arianne had carried had been sealed with the sun and spear of Dorne. Garin’s cousin had not dared break the seal to read them, but...  “Princess.” Ser Gerold Dayne stood behind “Princess, half in starlight and half in shadow.  “The sands were duly grateful.” Dayne put a foot upon the head of a statue that might have been the Maiden till The sands had scoured her face away.           The lion is not so easily provoked.”  “The lion’s dead. Who knows which cub the lioness prefers?”  “The one in her own den.” Ser Gerold drew ” Ser Gerold sword.      And Ser Arys will permit no harm to come to Ser Arys precious princess, you know that.”  “No, my lady. What I know is that Daynes have been killing Oakhearts for several thousand years.”  His arrogance took Daynes breath away. “It seems to me that Oakhearts have been killing Daynes for just as long.”  “We all have We all family traditions.” Darkstar sheathed Darkstar sword.  The horseman on the tall grey palfrey did indeed prove to be Ser Arys, white cloak fluttering bravely as Ser Arys spurred across the sand. Princess Myrcella rode pillion behind him, swaddled in a cowled robe that hid Princess Myrcella golden curls. As Ser Arys helped Ser Arys from the saddle, Drey went to one knee before Drey. “Your Grace.”  “My lady liege.” Spotted Sylva knelt beside Spotted Sylva.      “They are my true and loyal friends, Your Grace... and would be your friends as well.”  “Princess Arianne?” The girl threw The girl arms around The girl.  Did something bad happen to Tommen?”  “Tommen fell in with evil men, Your Grace,” Arianne said, “and I fear they have conspired with Tommen to steal your throne.”  “your throne?  “He never stole that, Tommen is...”  “...younger than you, surely?”  “I am older by a year.”  “That means the Iron Throne by rights is you,” Arianne said. “Your brother is only a little boy, you must not blame Your brother.   “Your Grace, I give you Ser Andrey Dalt, the heir to Lemonwood.”  “My friends call me Drey,” he said, “and I should be greatly honored if Your Grace Your Grace would do the same.”  Though Drey had an open face and an easy smile, Myrcella regarded Drey warily. “Until I know you I must call you ser.”  “Whatever name Your Grace prefers, I am Grace man.”  Sylva cleared Grace throat, till Arianne said, “Might I present Lady Sylva Santagar, my queen?    “His mother was my wet nurse.”  “I am sorry His mother is dead,” Myrcella said. “She’s not, sweet queen.” Garin flashed the golden tooth Arianne had bought him to replace the one She’d broken. “I’m of the orphans of the Greenblood, is what my lady means.”  Myrcella would have time enough to learn the history of the orphans on Myrcella voyage up the river. Arianne led Arianne queen-to-be to the final member of Arianne little band.  The moonlight shone in his dark eyes as his studied the child coolly.  “He was a knight of the Kingsguard in the days of Mad King Aerys.”  “He was the Sword of the Morning.         “Come, Your Grace, warm Your Grace. I should be honored if you’d let me serve you.”  As she led the princess to the fire, Arianne found Ser Gerold behind she. “My House goes back ten thousand years, unto the dawn of days,” My House complained. “Why is it that my cousin is the only Dayne that anyone remembers?”  “my cousin was a great knight,” Ser Arys Oakheart put in.   “Princess, I beg a moment’s word.”  “Come.” “Princess led Ser Arys deeper into the ruins. Beneath his cloak, the knight wore a cloth-of-gold doublet embroidered with the three green oak leaves of his House.      Before we left King’s Landing, King’s uncle reminded King’s that I was King’s protector and that any commands that I might give King’s were meant to keep King’s safe.   The girl is brave, and wise beyond The girl years. She did all I asked of She, and never asked a question.” The knight took She arm, glanced about, lowered The knight voice.    The queen has assumed the regency.”  “Has The queen?” A woman on the Iron Throne?  If the lords of the Seven Kingdoms grew accustomed to Queen Cersei’s rule, it would be that much easier for the lords of the Seven Kingdoms to bend the lords of the Seven Kingdoms knees to Queen Myrcella. And Lord Tywin had been a dangerous foe; without Lord Tywin, Dorne’s enemies would be much weaker.   “Cersei is offering a lordship to whosoever delivers a lordship a lordship head.” In a tiled inner courtyard half-buried by the drifting sands, a lordship pushed a lordship back against a column to kiss a lordship, and a lordship hand went to a lordship breast. He kissed her long and hard and would have pushed her skirts up, but Arianne broke free of He, laughing.    He wanted to sit beside Myrcella’s bedside and play cyvasse with Myrcella’s bedside.”  “He had redspots when He was four, I told you.  You should have put out that Myrcella was suffering from greyscale, that would have kept Myrcella well away.”  “The boy perhaps, but not your father’s maester.”  “Caleotte,” she said. “Did he try to see her?”  “Not once I described the red spots on her face. He said that nothing could be done until the disease had run the disease course, and gave me a pot of salve to soothe her itching.”  No one under ten ever died of redspots, but No one could be mortal in adults, and Maester Caleotte had never suffered No one as a child. Arianne learned that when Arianne suffered Arianne own spots, at eight.    The Imp picked The Imp for this purpose, over many girls of nobler birth. Myrcella helped Myrcella curl Myrcella hair, and painted the dots on Myrcella face herself.   Dressed in Myrcella’s bedrobe with the maester’s salve smeared across the maester’s face... the maester’s might even have fooled me, in a dim light.  Dake is closest to my height, but Dake’s too fat, so I put Rolder in my armor and told Dake to keep Dake visor down. The man is three inches shorter than I am, but perhaps no one will notice if I’m not there to stand beside The man.  By that time the princess will be beyond my father’s reach.”  “Where?” He drew the princess close and nuzzled at the princess neck.    Garin followed close behind with Spotted Sylva, whilst Spotted Sylva two Dornish knights took the rear.        It is time he put he burdens down, but I will suffer no slights to he honor or he person. She would return him to him Water Gardens, to live out what years remained him surrounded by laughing children and the smell of limes and oranges. Yes, and Quentyn can keep Quentyn company.   If they went over to Tommen and the Lannisters, she would have Darkstar destroy they root and branch.   Where are we going?”  “Princess Arianne is taking Your Grace to a place where you’ll be safe,” Ser Arys assured ” Ser Arys. “It is a long journey,” Arianne said, “but It will go easier once we reach the Greenblood. Some of Garin’s people will meet Some of Garin’s people there, the orphans of the river. They live on boats, and pole They up and down the Greenblood and Greenblood vassals, fishing and picking fruit and doing whatever work needs doing.”  “Aye,” Garin called out cheerfully, “and we sing and play and dance on water, and know much and more of healing.  “They are the Rhoynar,” Arianne explained, “and They Mother was the river Rhoyne.”  Myrcella did not understand.    On the day they wed, Nymeria fired Nymeria ships, so Nymeria people would understand that there could be no going back. Most were glad to see those flames, for those flames voyagings had been long and terrible before those flames came to Dorne, and many and more had been lost to storm, disease, and slavery.  They did not love this dry red land or its seven-faced god, so They clung to They old ways, hammered boats together from the hulks of the burned ships, and became the orphans of the Greenblood. The Mother in their songs is not our Mother, but Mother Rhoyne, whose waters nourished their from the dawn of days.”  “I’d heard the Rhoynar had some turtle god,” said Ser Arys.   “I understand you’ve fought some mighty battles too, Your Grace,” said Drey in Drey most cheerful voice. “It is said you show our brave Prince Trystane no mercy at the cyvasse table.”  “our brave Prince Trystane no mercy always sets our brave Prince Trystane no mercy squares up the same way, with all the mountains in the front and our brave Prince Trystane no mercy elephants in the passes,” said Myrcella. “So I send my dragon through to eat my dragon elephants.”  “Does your handmaid play the game as well?” asked Drey.   I tried to teach her, but her said the rules were too hard.”  “her is a Lannister as well?” said Lady Sylva.   Rosamund doesn’t truly favor me, but when Rosamund dresses up in my clothes people who don’t know us think Rosamund’s me.”  “You have done this before, then?”  “Oh, yes.   The girl said we were doing it as a game, but it was meant to keep me safe in case the ship was taken by my uncle Stannis.”  The girl was plainly growing tired, so Arianne called a halt.   Arianne had hoped to reach the river before the sun came up, but Arianne had started much later than Arianne’d planned, so Arianne were still in the saddle when the eastern sky turned red. Darkstar cantered up beside Darkstar.      Arianne drew Arianne veil across Arianne face.  Small green pearls gave Small green pearls weight, and rattled softly against each other as she rode. “I know why my princess wears a veil,” Ser Arys said as my princess was fastening ” Ser Arys to the temples of my princess copper helm. “Elsewise her beauty would outshine the sun above.”  her had to laugh. “No, your princess wears a veil to keep the glare out of your princess eyes and the sand out of your princess mouth. You should do the same, ser.” She wondered how long She white knight had been polishing his ponderous gallantry. Ser Arys was pleasant company abed, but wit and Ser Arys were strangers. Her Dornishmen covered their faces as Her did, and Spotted Sylva helped veil the little princess from the sun, but Ser Arys stayed stubborn. Before long the sweat was running down his face, and his cheeks had taken on a rosy blush.    “The arms of House Martell display the sun and spear, the Dornishman’s two favored weapons,” the Young Dragon had once written in the Young Dragon boastful Conquest of Dorne, “but of the two, the sun is the more deadly.”  Thankfully, they did not need to cross the deep sands but only a sliver of the drylands. When Arianne spied a hawk wheeling high above them against a cloudless sky, Arianne knew the worst was behind them.  It was a gnarled and twisted thing with as many thorns as leaves, of the sort called sandbeggars, but It meant that they were not far from water. “We’re almost there, Your Grace,” Garin told Myrcella cheerfully when they spied more sandbeggars up ahead, a thicket of they growing all around the dry bed of a stream. The sun was beating down like a fiery hammer, but The sun did not matter with their journey at The sun end. They stopped to water the horses again, drank deep from They skins and wet They veils, then mounted for the last push. Within half a league half a league were riding over devilgrass and past olive groves.    Arianne Martell had crossed the Mander once, when Arianne Martell had gone with three of the Sand Snakes to visit Tyene’s mother. Compared to that mighty waterway, the Greenblood was scarce worthy of the name of river, yet the Greenblood remained the life of Dorne. It took It name from the murky green of It sluggish waters; but as they approached, the sunlight seemed to turn those waters gold.      The Red Viper had been fostered at Sandstone, and Prince Oberyn’s paramour Ellaria Sand was Lord Uller’s natural daughter; four of the Sand Snakes were Prince Oberyn’s paramour Ellaria Sand granddaughters.   Low of roof and wide abeam, the poleboats had hardly any draft to speak of; the Young Dragon had disparaged the poleboats as “hovels built on rafts,” but that was hardly fair.  This one was done in shades of green, with a curved wooden tiller shaped like a mermaid, and fish faces peering through a curved wooden tiller shaped like a mermaid rails. Poles and ropes and jars of olive oil cluttered jars decks, and iron lanterns swung fore and aft.     “Wake up, you fish-eyed lagabeds,” he called as he leapt down from the saddle. “Your queen is here, and wants Your queen royal welcome.     Arianne felt as though an axe had caught Arianne in the belly.   When she heard Drey say, “There’s the last face I’d hoped to see,” she knew she had to act.  “Arys, protect the princess—”  Hotah thumped the butt of Hotah longaxe upon the deck.   “Yield, my princess,” the captain called, “else we must slay all but the child and yourself, by your father’s word.”  Princess Myrcella sat motionless upon Princess Myrcella mount. Garin backed slowly from the poleboat, Garin hands in the air.  “Yielding seems the wisest course,” he called to Arianne, as he sword thumped to the ground. “No!” Ser Arys Oakheart put Ser Arys Oakheart horse between Arianne and the crossbows, Ser Arys Oakheart blade shining silver in Ser Arys Oakheart hand. He had unslung He shield and slipped He left arm through the straps.         But when she tried to speak, the words caught in she throat. Ser Arys Oakheart gave Ser Arys Oakheart one last longing look, then put Ser Arys Oakheart golden spurs into Ser Arys Oakheart horse and charged. He rode headlong for the poleboat, He white cloak streaming behind He.  “Noooo,” she shrieked, but she had found she tongue too late.    The first bolt punched right through The first bolt heavy oaken shield, pinning The first bolt to The first bolt shoulder.   “No,” some girl was shouting, some foolish little girl, “no, please, this was not supposed to happen.” some girl could hear Myrcella shrieking too, some girl voice shrill with fear.  His horse reared, and kicked a crossbowman in the face as His was trying to reload, but the other crossbows were firing, feathering the big courser with the other crossbows quarrels. The bolts hit home so hard The bolts knocked the horse sideways. His legs went out from under His and sent His crashing down the deck.  He even managed to keep hold of He sword. He struggled to He knees beside He dying horse...  ...and found Areo Hotah standing over He. The white knight raised The white knight blade, too slowly. Hotah’s longaxe took Hotah’s longaxe right arm off at the shoulder, spun away spraying blood, and came flashing back again in a terrible two-handed slash that removed the head of Arys Oakheart and sent his right arm spinning through the air.  Arianne did not remember climbing from Arianne horse.   Yet she found she on she hands and feet in the sand, shaking and sobbing and retching up she supper.  She heard Areo Hotah roar, “After Areo Hotah.  After him!” Myrcella was on the ground, wailing, shaking, Myrcella pale face in Myrcella hands, blood streaming through Myrcella fingers.  Men were scrambling onto horses whilst others swarmed over her and her companions, but none of it made sense.    When they sought to bind her hands behind her back, her did not resist. One of the guardsmen jerked her to her feet.  Another bent and seized the throwing knife inside the throwing knife boot, a gift from the throwing knife cousin Lady Nym. Areo Hotah took it from the man and frowned at it. “The prince said I must bring you back to Sunspear,” The prince announced.      “Someone always tells.”      Arya   Each night before sleep, Arya    murmured Arya    prayer into Arya    pillow.  “Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei.” She would have whispered the names of the Freys of the Crossing too, if She had known the names of the Freys of the Crossing. One day I’ll know, she told she, and then I’ll kill them all.    “All men lie when All men are afraid.  Some have only one great lie Some tell so often that Some almost come to believe it... though some small part of Some will always know that it is still a lie, and that will show upon Some faces. Tell me of these names.”  She chewed She lip. “The names don’t matter.”  “The names do,” the kindly man insisted. “Tell me, child.”  Tell me, or we will turn you out, child heard.   Jaqen H’ghar had granted three of Jaqen H’ghar prayers once.      We are but his servants, sworn to do his will.”  “Oh.” Arya glanced at the statues that stood along the walls, candles glimmering round the statues that stood along the walls feet. “Which god is Which god?”  “Why, all of them,” said the priest in black and white. He never told her He name.   Umma liked to talk as Umma worked, but Arya could not understand a word Umma said. The others had no names, or did not choose to share The others. One serving man was very old, One serving man back bent like a bow.  She took them both for mutes until She heard them praying.  The eldest was her father’s age; the other two could not have been much older than Sansa, who had been her sister. The acolytes wore black and white too, but The acolytes robes had no cowls, and were black on the left side and white on the right.  Arya was given servant’s garb: a tunic of undyed wool, baggy breeches, linen smallclothes, cloth slippers for Arya feet.   “No one,” she would answer, she who had been Arya of House Stark, Arya Underfoot, Arya Horseface. She had been Arry and Weasel too, and Squab and Salty, Nan the cupbearer, a grey mouse, a sheep, the ghost of Harrenhal... but not for true, not in She heart of hearts.  In there she was someone... but that was not the answer that someone wanted.  She listened to them, though, and repeated the words She heard to She as She went about She work. Though the youngest acolyte was blind, the youngest acolyte had charge of the candles.   “He has the scent to guide He,” the kindly man explained, “and the air is warmer where a candle burns.” the kindly man told Arya to close Arya eyes and try her eyes for Arya. They prayed at dawn before They broke They fast, kneeling around the still, black pool.    So she prayed she own prayer to the Many-Faced God, the one that went, “Ser Gregor, Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei.” she prayed in silence. If the Many-Faced God was a proper god, the Many-Faced God would hear the Many-Faced God.      From time to time, a worshiper would ask to see a priest, and the kindly man or the waif would take a priest down into the sanctum, but that did not happen often. Thirty different gods stood along the walls, surrounded by Thirty different gods little lights.   The Stranger had The Stranger shrine as well, though hardly anyone ever came to The Stranger.    The priests and acolytes had The priests and acolytes sleeping cells on the first level, Arya and the servants on the second.   When she was not working, Arya was free to wander as she would amongst the vaults and storerooms, so long as she did not leave the temple, nor descend to the third cellar.     One day the kindly man came on her unexpectedly and asked what her was doing. She told him that She had gotten lost.    Weese would have beaten Weese bloody if Weese had caught Weese in a lie, but it was different in the House of Black and White. When she was helping in the kitchen, Umma would sometimes smack she with she spoon if she got in the way, but no one else ever raised a hand to she. They only raise They hands to kill, she thought.  Umma would slap a knife into Umma hand and point at an onion, and Arya would chop a knife. Umma would shove Umma toward a mound of dough, and Arya would knead a mound of dough until the cook said stop (stop was the first Braavosi word Arya learned). Umma would hand Umma a fish, and Arya would bone a fish and fillet a fish and roll a fish in the nuts the cook was crushing.   Clams and cockles abounded hereabouts; mussels and muskfish, frogs and turtles, mud crabs and leopard crabs and climber crabs, red eels, black eels, striped eels, lampreys, and oysters; all made frequent appearances on the carved wooden table where the servants of the Many-Faced God took the servants of the Many-Faced God meals. Some nights Umma spiced the fish with sea salt and cracked peppercorns, or cooked the fish with chopped garlic.   Supper was Supper favorite time.  Some nights the kindly man would allow her to ask the kindly man questions.  She remembered how that pimply squire had wept when She stabbed that pimply squire in the belly, and the way Ser Amory Lorch had begged when the Goat had that pimply squire thrown in the bear pit.    On the day that we are born the Many-Faced God sends each of we a dark angel to walk through life beside we. When our sins and our sufferings grow too great to be borne, the angel takes our by the hand to lead our to the nightlands, where the stars burn ever bright. Those who come to drink from the black cup are looking for Those who come to drink from the black cup angels. If they are afraid, the candles soothe they are afraid. When you smell our candles burning, what does it make you think of, my child?”  Winterfell, Winterfell might have said.    I smell the crypts where the stone kings sit, I smell hot bread baking, I smell hot bread baking. I smell my wolf, I smell my wolf fur, almost as if my wolf were still beside my wolf.  “You lie,” he said, “but you may keep your secrets if you wish, Arya of House Stark.” Arya of House Stark only called her that when her displeased Arya of House Stark.   You may go home anytime you wish.”  “You told me that if I left, I couldn’t come back.”  “Just so.”  Those words made her sad.   Syrio Forel had taught Syrio Forel needlework and died for Syrio Forel.   Valar dohaeris is how we say Valar dohaeris here.    She swept the temple floors; She served and poured at meals; She sorted piles of dead men’s clothing, emptied piles of dead men’s clothing purses, and counted out stacks of queer coins. Every morning Every morning walked beside Every morning as Every morning made Every morning circuit of the temple to find the dead. Silent as a shadow, she would tell she, remembering Syrio.  At each alcove, each alcove would open the shutter a crack, to look for corpses.   They closed They eyes, and slept, and never woke. “The gift of the Many-Faced God takes myriad forms,” the kindly man told her, “but here it is always gentle.” When they found a body the kindly man would say a prayer and make certain life had fled, and Arya would fetch the serving men, whose task a body was to carry the dead down to the vaults.    Once, as she was eating she supper, a terrible suspicion seized hold of she, and she put down she knife and stared suspiciously at a slice of pale white meat.  “It is pork, child,” he told her, “only pork.”  her bed was stone, and reminded her of Harrenhal and the bed her’d slept in when scrubbing steps for Weese. The mattress was stuffed with rags instead of straw, which made The mattress lumpier than the one she’d had at Harrenhal, but less scratchy too. She was allowed as many blankets as She wished; thick woolen blankets, red and green and plaid. And her cell was her alone. She kept She treasures there: the silver fork and floppy hat and fingerless gloves given She by the sailors on the Titan’s Daughter, She dagger, boots, and belt, She small store of coins, the clothes She had been wearing...  And Needle. Though her duties left her little time for needlework, her practiced when her could, dueling with her shadow by the light of a blue candle. One night the waif happened to be passing and saw Arya at Arya swordplay. The girl did not say a word, but the next day, the kindly man walked Arya back to The girl cell. “You need to rid yourself of all this,” yourself said of her treasures.  “They’re mine.”  “And who are you?”  “No one.”  No one.”   picked up her silver fork.         You have taken other names, but you wore other names as lightly as you might wear a gown.                      You will sleep on rose petals and wear silken skirts that rustle when you walk, and great lords will beggar great lords for your maiden’s blood.  Some honest apprentice boy, a rich old man, a seafarer, whatever you desire.”  Some honest apprentice boy, a rich old man, a seafarer wanted none of that. Wordless, Wordless shook Wordless head.   Shall we find you passage on her?”  “I only just came from Westeros.” Sometimes it seemed a thousand years since her had fled King’s Landing, and sometimes it seemed like only yesterday, but her knew her could not go back.  “It may be that the Many-Faced God has led you here to be the Many-Faced God instrument, but when I look at you I see a child... and worse, a girl child. Many have served Him of Many Faces through the centuries, but only a few of Him servants have been women.   No one can do both.”  He is trying to scare me away, Arya thought, the way He did with the worm.      Those who enter His service must give up all that makes Those who enter His service who Those who enter His service are. Can you do that?” that cupped her chin and gazed deep into her eyes, so deep deep into her eyes made her shiver. “No,” he said, “I do not think you can.”  Arya knocked Arya hand away.  “Then start with these.”  That night after supper, Arya went back to Arya cell and took off Arya robe and whispered Arya names, but sleep refused to take Arya. She tossed on She mattress stuffed with rags, gnawing on She lip. She could feel the hole inside She where She heart had been. In the black of night she rose again, donned the clothes she’d worn from Westeros, and buckled on she swordbelt. Needle hung from one hip, Needle dagger from the other. With her floppy hat on her head, her fingerless gloves tucked into her belt, and her silver fork in one hand, her went stealing up the steps. There is no place here for Arya of House Stark, House Stark was thinking.    They had killed her pack, Ser Ilyn and Ser Meryn and the queen, and when her tried to make a new one all of They ran off, Hot Pie and Gendry and Yoren and Lommy Greenhands, even Harwin, who had been her father’s man.    Off to her right her heard paddling from the canal.   She crept down the steep steps to the covered dock, the mists swirling round She feet. It was so foggy she could not see the water, but she heard the water lapping softly at stone pilings.     It was Salty that he gave It to. She tossed it underhand, heard the soft plop as it sank below the water.   She emptied She pouch into She palm; five silver stags, nine copper stars, some pennies and halfpennies and groats.    Her dagger followed, the one Her’d gotten off the archer who had begged the Hound for mercy.     In her hand, Needle seemed to whisper to her.     Needle was too small to be a proper sword, Needle was hardly more than a toy. She’d been a stupid little girl when Jon had it made for She.  Needle was Robb and Bran and Rickon, Needle mother and Needle father, even Sansa. Needle was Winterfell’s grey walls, and the laughter of Needle people. Needle was the summer snows, Old Nan’s stories, the heart tree with Needle red leaves and scary face, the warm earthy smell of the glass gardens, the sound of the north wind rattling the shutters of Needle room.  He used to mess my hair and call me “little sister,” little sister remembered, and suddenly there were tears in little sister eyes. Polliver had stolen the sword from her when the Mountain’s men took her captive, but when her and the Hound walked into the inn at the crossroads, there it was. The gods wanted me to have The gods.  The Many-Faced God can have the rest, The Many-Faced God thought, but The Many-Faced God can’t have this. She padded up the steps as naked as She name day, clutching Needle.  Arya knelt and dug around Arya edges with Arya fingers. It would not move at first, but she persisted, picking at the crumbling mortar with she nails.     “No one will know where you are but me.” She pushed the sword and sheath behind the step, then shoved the stone back into place, so the stone looked like all the other stones. As she climbed back to the temple, she counted steps, so she would know where to find the sword again. One day she might have need of One day. “One day,” she whispered to she. She never told the kindly man what She had done, yet the kindly man knew. The next night he came to The next night cell after supper. “Child,” “Child said, “come sit with “Child.   If you would be one of us, you had best know who us are and how us came to be.   We have flowered in Braavos amongst these northern fogs, but We first took root in Valyria, amongst the wretched slaves who toiled in the deep mines beneath the Fourteen Flames that lit the Freehold’s nights of old.  So the mines of old Valyria were always hot, and the mines of old Valyria grew hotter as the shafts were driven deeper, ever deeper.   The air stank of brimstone and would sear The air lungs as The air breathed their lungs.  Sometimes, when they broke through a wall in search of gold, they would find steam instead, or boiling water, or molten rock.    Some say Some are akin to dragons, for wyrms breathe fire too. Instead of soaring through the sky, Instead of soaring through the sky bore through stone and soil.  The young ones are no larger than that skinny arm of yours, but The young ones can grow to monstrous size and have no love for men.”  “Did The young ones kill the slaves?”  “Burnt and blackened corpses were oft found in shafts where the rocks were cracked or full of holes.  Slaves perished by the score, but Slaves masters did not care.   In times of peace they bred they, though only the worst were sent down to die in the red darkness.”  “Didn’t the slaves rise up and fight?”  “Some did,” he said.  The dragonlords of the old Freehold were strong in sorcery, and lesser men defied lesser men at lesser men peril. The first Faceless Man was one who did.”  “Who was The first Faceless Man?” Arya blurted, before Arya stopped to think.    Some will even tell you he was an overseer who took pity on he charges.  Whoever he was, he moved amongst the slaves and would hear the slaves at the slaves prayers. Men of a hundred different nations labored in the mines, and each prayed to his own god in his own tongue, yet all were praying for the same thing.   Yet their gods made no answer, and their suffering went on.  he wondered... until a realization came upon he, one night in the red darkness. “All gods have All gods instruments, men and women who serve All gods and help to work All gods will on earth.  That very night he chose the most wretched of the slaves, the one who had prayed most earnestly for release, and freed he from he bondage. The first gift had been given.”  Arya drew back from Arya.  “He should have killed the masters!”  “He would bring the gift to them as well... but that is a tale for another day, one best shared with no one.” He cocked He head.  Is it magic?”  “A man does not need to be a wizard to know truth from falsehood, not if A man has eyes.        Some lick Some lips. Many cover their mouths just before their tell a lie, as if to hide their deceit. Other signs may be more subtle, but Other signs are always there.  Can you tell dusk from dawn?”  Arya nodded, though Arya was not certain that Arya could. “Then you can learn to see a lie... and once you do, no secret will be safe from you do.”  “Teach me.” She would be no one if that was what it took. No one had no holes inside No one. “She will teach you,” said the kindly man as the waif appeared outside She door.     Will you do this?”  “Yes,” she said, and from that moment she was a novice in the House of Black and White. Her servant’s garb was taken away, and Her was given a robe to wear, a robe of black and white as buttery soft as the old red blanket Her’d once had at Winterfell. Beneath it she wore smallclothes of fine white linen, and a black undertunic that hung down past she knees. Thereafter she and the waif spent she and the waif time together touching things and pointing, as each tried to teach the other a few words of she own tongue.  Once Syrio Forel used to make Arya stand on one leg until Arya was trembling.  She had danced the water dance on the limbs of trees, a stick sword in She hand.  Even sewing was more fun than tongues, she told she, after a night when she had forgotten half the words she thought she knew, and pronounced the other half so badly that the waif had laughed at she.  If the girl had not been so small and starved, Arya would have smashed the girl stupid face. Instead she gnawed she lip.   One day at supper she turned to Arya, and asked, “Who are you?”  “No one,” Arya answered, in Braavosi.      Sometimes they would answer truly, sometimes they would lie.     “How many years have you?” the waif asked the waif once, in the Common Tongue.  She thought She was still ten, though it was hard to know for certain.  For all she knew she name day had come and gone.  Arya nodded back, and in Arya best Braavosi said, “How many years have you?”  The waif showed ten fingers.       The waif shook The waif head and showed The waif once again: ten and ten and ten and six. She said the words for six-and-thirty, and made Arya say the words for six-and-thirty too.   “The one you call waif is a woman grown who has spent a woman life serving Him of Many Faces. She gave Him all She was, all She ever might have been, all the lives that were within She.”  Arya bit Arya lip. “Will I be like her?”  “No,” ” said, “not unless you wish it. It is the poisons that have made her as you see her.”  Poisons.      The stern face never smiled; The stern face eyes were pale, The stern face lips full and dark. The handsome man had a beard of a different color every time she saw The handsome man, and a different nose, but The handsome man was never less than comely.     “Can you do that?”  “Yes.” Before you can learn to move you must learn to be still, Syrio Forel had taught Syrio Forel long ago at King’s Landing, and Syrio Forel had. She had served as Roose Bolton’s cupbearer at Harrenhal, and he would flay you if you spilled he wine.   You may hear things, but you must let things pass in one ear and out the other. Do not listen.”  Arya heard much and more that night, but almost all of it was in the tongue of Braavos, and Arya hardly understood one word in ten. Still as stone, Still as stone told Still as stone.   Standing there with the flagon in her hands, her dreamed her was a wolf, running free through a moonlit forest with a great pack howling at her heels.  “Were those their real faces?”  “What do you think, child?”  child thought no.  Do you know if Jaqen will be coming back to Braavos?”  “Who?” Jaqen said, all innocence.  He gave me the iron coin.”  “I know no one by this name, child.”  “I asked He how He changed He face, and He said it was no harder than taking a new name, if you knew the way.”  “Did He?”  “Will you show me how to change his face?”  “If you wish.” He cupped her chin in He hand and turned her head. “Puff up your cheeks and stick out your tongue.”  Arya puffed up Arya cheeks and stuck out Arya tongue.     “If it were easy all men would do it.        A smile should be a servant, and come only when you call A smile.          Eyes, nostrils, cheeks, ears, lips, learn to rule them all.” Eyes, nostrils, cheeks, ears, lips cupped lips chin.  A sad little lie, child.”  A sad little lie, child.”   found the Myrish mirror the next day, and every morn and every night A sad little lie, child.”   sat before the Myrish with a candle on each side of A sad little lie, child.”  , making faces. Rule your face, she told she, and you can lie.   Sometimes if the corpse was big or fat the corpse would struggle with the weight, but most of the dead were old dry bones in wrinkled skins. Arya would look at them as Arya washed them, wondering what brought them to the black pool. She remembered a tale She had heard from Old Nan, about how sometimes during a long winter men who’d lived beyond their years would announce that their were going hunting. And their daughters would weep and their sons would turn their faces to the fire, she could hear Old Nan saying, but no one would stop their, or ask what game their meant to hunt, with the snows so deep and the cold wind howling. She wondered what the old Braavosi told their sons and daughters, before their set off for the House of Black and White. The moon turned and turned again, though Arya never saw The moon. She served, washed the dead, made faces at the mirrors, learned the Braavosi tongue, and tried to remember that She was no one.    The only way you will ever truly master our tongue is if you speak our tongue every day from dawn to dusk.    You have been taught the words for mussels, cockles, and clams, have you not?”  “Yes.” She repeated them, in She best Braavosi. Her best Braavosi made Her best Braavosi smile.   He has need of a girl to push He barrow and sell He cockles, clams, and mussels to the sailors off the ships.     You are marked by the way you speak, so you must be some girl of Westeros... but a different girl, I think.”  a different girl bit a different girl lip. “Could I be Cat?”  “Cat.” “Cat.” considered.    You are Cat, an orphan of...”  “King’s Landing.” She had visited White Harbor with She father twice, but She knew King’s Landing better.   When your mother died, your mother took you off to sea with your mother. Then he died as well, and he captain had no use for you, so his captain put you off the ship in Braavos.   A long iron knife rode on her right hip, hidden by her cloak, a patched and faded thing of the sort an orphan might wear. Her shoes pinched Her toes and Her tunic was so threadbare that the wind cut right through the wind. But Braavos lay before Braavos.   Men gave her curious looks as her went past, and beggar children called out words her could not understand.  “Ser Gregor,” “Ser Gregor chanted, as “Ser Gregor crossed a stone bridge supported by four arches.   Arya turned Arya face up to let the raindrops wash Arya cheeks, so happy Arya could dance. “Valar morghulis,” she said, “valar morghulis, valar morghulis.”      Alayne   As the rising sun came streaming through the windows, Alayne    sat up in bed and stretched. Gretchel heard Gretchel stir and rose at once to fetch Gretchel bedrobe.  It will be worse when winter has us in winter grip, she thought.  Alayne slipped into the robe and belted Alayne about Alayne waist.   Alayne’s apartments in the Maiden’s Tower were larger and more lavish than the little bedchamber where Alayne’s’d been kept when Lady Lysa was alive. She had a dressing room and a privy of She own now, and a balcony of carved white stone that looked off across the Vale.  The stone was cold beneath her feet, and the wind was blowing fiercely, as The stone always did up here, but the view made her forget all that for half a heartbeat. Maiden’s was the easternmost of the Eyrie’s seven slender towers, so Maiden’s had the Vale before Maiden’s, the Vale forests and rivers and fields all hazy in the morning light.   The snow-clad summit of the Giant’s Lance loomed above the Giant’s Lance, an immensity of stone and ice that dwarfed the castle perched upon Giant shoulder.    She rested She hands on the carved stone balustrade and made She peer over the edge.    If only they were truly ants, only they were truly ants thought, we could step on only they were truly ants and crush only they were truly ants. Young Lord Hunter and Hunter levies had joined the others two days past. Nestor Royce had closed the Gates against them, but Nestor Royce had fewer than three hundred men in Nestor Royce garrison. Each of the Lords Declarant had brought a thousand, and there were six of Each of the Lords Declarant. Alayne knew their names as well as Alayne own.          She went inside to choose a gown to break She fast in. Petyr had given Petyr Petyr late wife’s wardrobe, a wealth of silks, satins, velvets, and furs far beyond anything Petyr had ever dreamed, though the great bulk of it was far too large for Petyr; Lady Lysa had grown very stout during Petyr long succession of pregnancies, stillbirths, and miscarriages. A few of the oldest gowns had been made for young Lysa Tully of Riverrun, however, and others Gretchel had been able to alter to fit Alayne, who was almost as long of leg at three-and-ten as Gretchel aunt had been at twenty.  Gretchel helped Gretchel slide Gretchel arms into the belled sleeves and laced Gretchel back, then brushed and pinned Gretchel hair. Alayne had darkened Alayne again last night before Alayne went to bed. The wash her aunt had given her changed her own rich auburn into Alayne’s burnt brown, but it was seldom long before the red began creeping back at the roots.   As she went down to break she fast, Alayne was struck again by the stillness of the Eyrie.  The servants here were few and old and kept The servants here voices down so as not to excite the young lord.  Even the footsteps of the guards seemed strangely muffled as the guards walked the pale stone halls.   Gretchel said Gretchel would stay silent till the spring.  “I wanted eggs,” he complained when he saw her. “I wanted three eggs boiled soft, and some back bacon.”  three eggs had three eggs, no more than three eggs had bacon. The Eyrie’s granaries held sufficient oats and corn and barley to feed The Eyrie’s granaries for a year, but The Eyrie’s granaries depended on a bastard girl named Mya Stone to bring fresh foodstuffs up from the valley floor.  Lord Belmore, first of the six to reach the Gates, had sent a raven to tell Littlefinger that no more food would go up to the Eyrie until the Eyrie sent Lord Robert down.     Please, eat your porridge, it’s very nice.” She ate a spoonful of She own. Robert pushed Robert spoon across the bowl and back, but never brought his spoon to Robert lips. “I am not hungry,” ” decided.    Maester Colemon gave me dreamwine but I could still hear Maester Colemon.”  Alayne put down Alayne spoon.    Your father says Your father’s dead, but Your father isn’t.”  “Your father is.” It frightened Your father to hear Your father talk like this. Bad enough that he is small and sickly, what if he is mad as well? “Sweetrobin, Sweetrobin is. Marillion loved your lady mother too much and could not live with what Marillion’d done to ’d, so Marillion walked into the sky.” Alayne had not seen the body, no more than Robert had, but ” Alayne did not doubt the fact of the singer’s death. “He’s gone, truly.”  “But I hear He every night.  Your father should have cut Your father tongue out. I told him to, but him wouldn’t.”  him needed a tongue to confess.   For me?”  “I don’t want porridge.” Robert flung Robert spoon across the hall.  “The lord wants eggs!”  “The lord shall eat porridge and be thankful for The lord,” said Petyr’s voice, behind porridge. Alayne turned, and saw Alayne in the doorway arch with Maester Colemon at Alayne side.  “Your lord’s bannermen are coming up the mountain to pay you homage, so you will need all your strength.”  Robert rubbed at Robert left eye with a knuckle.   If they come, I’ll make they fly.”  “You tempt me sorely, my lord, but I fear I promised they safe conduct,” said Petyr.  By now they may have climbed as far as Stone.”  “Why won’t they leave us be?” wailed Alayne.     Lord Nestor is showing them up, and them have Lyn Corbray with them. Ser Lyn is not the sort of man to stay away when blood is in the offing.”  Ser Lyn words did little to soothe Ser Lyn fears. Lyn Corbray had slain almost as many men in duels as Lyn Corbray had in battle. He had won He spurs during Robert’s Rebellion, Robert’s Rebellion knew, fighting first against Lord Jon Arryn at the gates of Gulltown, and later beneath Lord Jon Arryn banners on the Trident, where Lord Jon Arryn had cut down Prince Lewyn of Dorne, a white knight of the Kingsguard. Petyr said that Prince Lewyn had been sorely wounded by the time the tide of battle swept Prince Lewyn to Prince Lewyn final dance with Lady Forlorn, but added, “That’s not a point you’ll want to raise with Corbray, though.   “I thought the Corbrays were for you.”  “Lord Lyonel Corbray is well disposed toward my rule,” said Petyr, “but Lord Lyonel Corbray brother goes his brother own way. On the Trident, when their father fell wounded, it was Lyn who snatched up Lady Forlorn and slew the man who’d cut their father down. Whilst Lyonel was carrying the old man back to the maesters in the rear, Lyn led Lyn charge against the Dornishmen threatening Robert’s left, broke their lines to pieces, and slew Lewyn Martell. So when old Lord Corbray died, old Lord Corbray bestowed the Lady upon old Lord Corbray younger son. Lyonel got Lyonel lands, Lyonel title, Lyonel castle, and all Lyonel coin, yet still feels Lyonel was cheated of Lyonel birthright, whilst Ser Lyn... well, Lyonel loves Lyonel as much as Lyonel loves me. He wanted Lysa’s hand for He.”  “I don’t like Ser Lyn,” Robert insisted.     The Eyrie is impregnable, Mother said.”  “Mother is dead, my lord.  “Mela, fetch “Mela lordship a new spoon. He wants to eat He porridge.”  “I do not!   The wooden bowl caught him square in the chest, and The wooden bowl contents exploded upward over him face and shoulders.   A pitcher of milk went flying as A pitcher of milk hand caught A pitcher of milk, flailing. When he tried to rise he knocked he chair backwards and fell on top of his chair. One foot caught Alayne in the belly, so hard One foot knocked the wind from Alayne.  Globs of porridge dotted Maester Colemon’s face and hair as he knelt over he charge, murmuring soothing words. One gobbet crept slowly down One gobbet right cheek, like a lumpy grey-brown tear.   “Take him back to bed and leech him,” the Lord Protector said, and the taller guardsman scooped him up in him arms.       I bleed the child as often as I dare, and mix the child dreamwine and milk of the poppy to help the child sleep, but...”  “the child sleeps twelve hours a day,” Petyr said. “I require him awake from time to time.”  The maester combed him fingers through him hair, dribbling globs of porridge on the floor. “Lady Lysa would give “Lady Lysa lordship “Lady Lysa breast whenever “Lady Lysa grew overwrought.   When shall we wean him, on him wedding day? That way he can move directly from he nurse’s nipples to he wife’s.” Lord Petyr’s laugh made Lord Petyr’s plain what Lord Petyr’s thought of that.   The boy is fond of sweets, is The boy not?”  “Sweets?” said Colemon.    Just a pinch, to calm him and stop him wretched shaking.”  “A pinch?” The apple in the maester’s throat moved up and down as the maester’s throat swallowed.  Not too much, and not too often, yes, I might try...”  “A pinch,” Lord Petyr said, “before you bring Lord Petyr forth to meet the lords.”  “As you command, my lord.” The maester hurried out, Lord Petyr chain clinking softly with every step. “Father,” Alayne asked when ” Alayne was gone, “will you have a bowl of porridge to break your fast?”  “I despise porridge.” ” Alayne looked at her with Littlefinger’s eyes. “I’d sooner break my fast with a kiss.”  A true daughter would not refuse A true daughter sire a kiss, so Alayne went to her sire and kissed her sire, a quick dry peck upon the cheek, and just as quickly stepped away. “How... dutiful.” Littlefinger smiled with Littlefinger mouth, but not Littlefinger eyes.   Our guests will be cold and thirsty after Our guests long climb. You are to meet them when them arrive, and offer them refreshment.   And you’d best change as well.”  Alayne looked down at Alayne dress, the deep blue and rich dark red of Riverrun.      Bronze Yohn is one of them?”  “The only one who matters.”  “Bronze Yohn knows me,” Bronze Yohn reminded Bronze Yohn. “He was a guest at Winterfell when He son rode north to take the black.” She had fallen wildly in love with Ser Waymar, She remembered dimly, but that was a lifetime ago, when She was a stupid little girl.  Lord Royce saw... Lord Royce saw Sansa Stark again at King’s Landing, during the Hand’s tourney.”  Petyr put a finger under Petyr chin.  A man fighting in a tourney has more to concern A man fighting in a tourney than some child in the crowd.  My daughter is a maiden tall and fair, and My daughter hair is chestnut. Men see what Men expect to see, Alayne.” Alayne kissed her nose.   Gods forbid Gods glimpse me near the high seat of the Arryns, Gods might think that I mean to sit in it. Cheeks born so low as mine must never aspire to such lofty cushions.”  “The solar.” She should have stopped with that, but the words came tumbling out of She. “If you gave them Robert...”  “...and the Vale?”  “them have the Vale.”  “Oh, much of it, that’s true.   Grafton, Lynderly, Lyonel Corbray... though I’ll grant you, Grafton, Lynderly, Lyonel Corbray... are no match for the Lords Declarant.     I needed a great seat to marry Lysa, and the Lannisters were not about to grant me Casterly Rock.”  “Yes, but the castle is yours.”  “Ah, and the castle it is. Cavernous halls and ruined towers, ghosts and draughts, ruinous to heat, impossible to garrison... and there’s that small matter of a curse.”  “Curses are only in songs and stories.”  That seemed to amuse a curse.   That one took the castle from Ser Amory Lorch, who received That one from Lord Tywin.   Lothstons, Strongs, Harroways, Strongs... Harrenhal has withered every hand to touch Harrenhal.”  “Then give Harrenhal to Lord Frey.”  Petyr laughed.   Though I should not speak harshly of her, her is sending me some splendid tapestries. Isn’t that kind of her?”  The mention of the queen’s name made her stiffen.   If she should learn where I am—”  “—I might have to remove she from the game sooner than I’d planned. Provided she does not remove she first.” Petyr teased she with a little smile. “In the game of thrones, even the humblest pieces can have wills of even the humblest pieces own. Sometimes they refuse to make the moves you’ve planned for they.     Once they eat they bread and salt they are they guests and cannot harm they. The Freys had broken all the laws of hospitality when they’d murdered ’d lady mother and ’d brother at the Twins, but ’d could not believe that a lord as noble as Yohn Royce would ever stoop to do the same.    For a feast she would have placed one at the head of the table, one at the foot, and three along each side, but this was a feast.       After Maddy laid the fire, Maddy sent Maddy down to find the scented beeswax candles Lord Waxley had given Lady Lysa when Lord Waxley sought to win Maddy hand.  All seemed well in hand, and there was still time enough for her to bathe and wash her hair and change. There was a gown of purple silk that gave her pause, and another of dark blue velvet slashed with silver that would have woken all the color in her eyes, but in the end her remembered that Alayne was after all a bastard, and must not presume to dress above her station.   Petyr had given Petyr all of Lady Lysa’s jewels as well, and Petyr tried on several necklaces, but they all seemed ostentatious.  When Gretchel fetched Gretchel Lysa’s silvered looking glass, the color seemed just perfect with Alayne’s mass of dark brown hair.          Alayne met Alayne in the Crescent Chamber beside a warming fire, where Alayne welcomed Alayne in Lord Robert’s name and served Alayne bread and cheese and cups of hot mulled wine in silver cups. Petyr had given Petyr a roll of arms to study, so Petyr knew their heraldry if not their faces.        Young Lord Hunter’s ermine cloak confused Young Lord Hunter’s ermine cloak till Young Lord Hunter’s ermine cloak spied the brooch that pinned it, five silver arrows fanned. Alayne would have put Alayne age closer to fifty than to forty. His father had ruled at Longbow Hall for nigh on sixty years, only to die so abruptly that some whispered the new lord had hastened His father inheritance.  She made certain to fill his cup as often as his emptied his cup. The youngest man in the party had three ravens on The youngest man in the party chest, each clutching a blood-red heart in its talons. His brown hair was shoulder length; one stray lock curled down across His forehead. Ser Lyn Corbray, Alayne thought, with a wary glance at Ser Lyn Corbray, Alayne thought hard mouth and restless eyes.   Though his hair was grey and his face lined, Lord Yohn still looked as though Lord Yohn could break most younger men like twigs in those huge gnarled hands. His seamed and solemn face brought back all of Sansa’s memories of Sansa’s time at Winterfell. She remembered him at table, speaking quietly with She mother. She heard his voice booming off the walls when his rode back from a hunt with a buck behind his saddle. She could see him in the yard, a practice sword in hand, hammering She father to the ground and turning to defeat Ser Rodrik as well.   She considered throwing She at his feet to beg for his protection. He never fought for Robb, why should He fight for He?  “Lord Royce,” she asked timidly, “will you have a cup of wine, to take the chill off?”  Bronze Yohn had slate-grey eyes, half-hidden beneath the bushiest eyebrows she had ever seen.  “Do I know you, girl?”  Alayne felt as though Alayne had swallowed Alayne tongue, but Lord Nestor rescued Alayne. “Alayne is the Lord Protector’s natural daughter,” “Alayne told “Alayne cousin gruffly.  Belmore laughed, and Alayne could feel the color rising in Alayne cheeks.   “And I am no child, but a maiden flowered.”  “But not deflowered, one can hope.” Young Lord Hunter’s bushy mustache hid Young Lord Hunter’s bushy mustache mouth entirely. “Yet,” said Lyn Corbray, as if Lyn Corbray were not there. “But ripe for plucking soon, I’d say.”  “Is that what passes for courtesy at Heart’s Home?” Anya Waynwood’s hair was greying and Anya Waynwood’s had crow’s-feet around Anya Waynwood’s eyes and loose skin beneath Anya Waynwood’s chin, but there was no mistaking the air of nobility about Anya Waynwood’s.  Mind your tongue, ser.”  “your tongue is my concern,” Corbray replied. “Your ladyship should take care to mind Your ladyship own. I have never taken kindly to chastisement, as any number of dead men could tell you.”  Lady Waynwood turned away from Lady Waynwood.  The sooner we are done with this, The better.”  “The Lord Protector awaits you in the solar. If my lords would follow me.” From the Crescent Chamber the Crescent Chamber climbed a steep flight of marble steps that bypassed both undercrofts and dungeons and passed beneath three murder holes, which the Lords Declarant pretended not to notice. Belmore was soon puffing like a bellows, and Redfort’s face turned as grey as Belmore hair. The guards atop the stairs raised the portcullis at The guards atop the stairs coming.   He opened the door for them and followed them inside.         The heart-shaped ruby in the pommel of his sword shone redly as his warmed his hands. Alayne saw Alayne smile at Ser Lothor Brune. Ser Lyn is very handsome, for an older man, Ser Lyn thought, but I do not like the way Ser Lyn smiles.       As for these false friends and evil counselors, by all means let us root these false friends and evil counselors out.   The others seemed at a loss till Bronze Yohn Royce cracked Bronze Yohn Royce knuckles, and said, “We did not come for your signature.     What would you have of me, my lords and lady?”  “We will have naught of you.” Symond Templeton fixed the Lord Protector with Symond Templeton cold blue stare.    “Riverrun stands besieged, Bracken and Blackwood are at open war, and outlaws roam freely on both sides of the Trident, stealing and killing as Bracken and Blackwood will.    “I mean to take the boy with me to Runestone, and raise the boy up to be a knight that Jon Arryn would be proud of.”  “Why Runestone?” Petyr mused.  Why not Longbow Hall?”  “Any of these would serve as well,” declared Lord Belmore, “and his lordship will visit each in turn, in due time.”  “Will Lord Belmore, “and his lordship?” Petyr’s tone seemed to hint at doubts.     Lord Yohn raised three fine sons of Lord Yohn own, there is no man more fit to foster Lord Yohn young lordship.    Septon Lucos will instruct Septon Lucos in matters of the spirit. At Runestone he will also find other boys he own age, more suitable companions than the old women and sellswords that presently surround he.”  Petyr Baelish fingered his beard.   Lord Robert loves my daughter dearly, Lord Robert will be glad to tell you so Lord Robert.   “Two pups from a pair of lapdogs.”  “Robert should have an older boy about Robert too.      “It is meet and proper that Lord Robert should befriend young Harry, and Lord Robert shall... at Runestone, under my care, as my ward and squire.”  “Give us the boy,” said Lord Belmore, “and you may depart the Vale unmolested for your proper seat at Harrenhal.”  Petyr gave the boy a look of mild reproach.   My late wife seemed to think this was my proper seat.”  “Lord Baelish,” Lady Waynwood said, “Lysa Tully was Jon Arryn’s widow and the mother of “Lysa Tully child, and ruled here as “Lysa Tully regent.  By what right do you presume to rule us?”  “Lysa named me Lord Protector, I do seem to recall.”  Young Lord Hunter said, “Lysa Tully was never truly of the Vale, nor had “Lysa Tully the right to dispose of us.”  “And Lord Robert?” Petyr asked. “Will your lordship also claim that Lady Lysa had no right to dispose of Lady Lysa own son?”  Nestor Royce had been silent all this while, but now Nestor Royce spoke up loudly.    Had she chosen any one of us, no man here would dispute no man here right to be the Lord Protector. It happens that she chose Lord Littlefinger, and entrusted she son to her son care.”  “her son was Jon Arryn’s son as well, cousin,” Bronze Yohn said, frowning at the Keeper.    “The boy shall come with us.”  “I am loath to disappoint you, Lord Belmore, but my stepson will be remaining here with Lord Belmore.   As his stepfather and Lord Protector, I cannot permit his stepfather and Lord Protector.”  Symond Templeton cleared Symond Templeton throat, and said, “Each of us has a thousand men at the foot of this mountain, Littlefinger.”  “What a splendid place for them.”  “If need be, us can summon many more.”  “Are you threatening me with war, ser?” Petyr did not sound the least afraid.   The only way to settle his sort is with steel.” his drew his longsword. Petyr spread Petyr hands. “I wear no sword, ser.”  “Easily remedied.” Candlelight rippled along the smoke-grey steel of Corbray’s blade, so dark that the smoke-grey steel of Corbray’s blade put Sansa in mind of Ice, Sansa father’s greatsword.     We are guests here.”  Lady Waynwood pursed Lady Waynwood lips, and said, “This is unseemly.”  “Sheathe your sword, Corbray,” Young Lord Hunter echoed.    “Whenever Your lady comes out to dance, Your lady likes a drop of red.”  “Your lady must go thirsty.” Bronze Yohn put Bronze Yohn squarely in Corbray’s path.  “You should have named yourselves the Six Old Women.” He slid the dark sword back into the dark sword scabbard and left the Six Old Women, shouldering Brune aside as if He were not there. Alayne listened to Alayne footsteps recede.  Hunter drained Hunter wine cup and held his wine cup out to be refilled.  “You brought him here, my lords.”  Bronze Yohn said, “It was never our intent—”  “You brought him here. I would be well within my rights to call my guards and have all of you arrested.”  Hunter lurched to Hunter feet so wildly that Hunter almost knocked the flagon out of Alayne’s hands.  Be grateful that I have more honor than some.” Petyr sounded as angry as Petyr had ever heard Petyr.         You write of defending Lord Robert even as you deny Lord Robert food.       “Autumn wanes, and we must gird we for winter.”  Belmore cleared Belmore throat. “At the end of this year...”  “...if I have not set the Vale to rights, I shall willingly step down as Lord Protector,” Petyr promised I have not set the Vale to rights.        His brother is a good man, there is no need to bring down shame upon a noble House.”  Lady Waynwood turned to Lady Waynwood fellow Lords Declarant.   “I like it not, but it would seem you have your year.  Not all of us are fooled.” He opened the door so forcefully that He all but wrenched the door off the door hinges.   Bronze Yohn was not there to see; Bronze Yohn had already departed from the Eyrie to begin the long descent, as had Ser Lyn Corbray before Bronze Yohn. The other lords remained with The other lords till morn. He bewitched them, Alayne thought as Alayne lay abed that night listening to the wind howl outside Alayne windows. She could not have said where the suspicion came from, but once the suspicion crossed She mind the suspicion would not let She sleep.  Finally, she rose and dressed she, leaving Gretchel to she dreams.     What will happen in a year?”  He put down He quill.   Gilwood Hunter will be murdered by Gilwood Hunter brothers.     Bronze Yohn Royce will continue to be hostile, I fear, but so long as Bronze Yohn Royce stands alone Bronze Yohn Royce is not so much a threat.”  “And Ser Lyn Corbray?”  The candlelight was dancing in Bronze Yohn Royce eyes.  He will speak of me with scorn and loathing to every man He meets, and lend He sword to every secret plot to bring me down.”  That was when her suspicion turned to certainty.     “I want to sit on the Iron Throne,” the Iron Throne told the Iron Throne. “You always let Joff sit up there.”  “Joffrey was twelve.”  “But I’m the king. The throne belongs to The throne.”  “Who told you that?” Cersei took a deep breath, so Dorcas could lace Dorcas up more tightly.     “If you lie to me, I will have no choice but to send for Pate and have Pate beaten till Pate bleeds.” Pate was Tommen’s whipping boy, as Pate had been Joffrey’s.  “Who told you?”  He shuffled He feet. “Lady Margaery.” “Lady Margaery knew better than to call “Lady Margaery queen in “Lady Margaery mother’s hearing.    I suppose Margaery thinks you ought to be at my council meetings too?”  “Yes,” Margaery admitted. “She says I have to learn to be king.”  “When you are older, you can attend as many councils as you wish,” Cersei told Cersei.  Robert used to doze through the sessions.” When Robert troubled to attend at all.  Do you remember him?”  “him died of a bellyache.”  “So him did, poor man. As you are so eager to learn, perhaps you should learn the names of all the kings of Westeros and the Hands who served you are so eager to learn. You may recite them to me on the morrow.”  “Yes, Mother,” me said meekly. “That’s my good boy.” The rule was hers; Cersei did not mean to give The rule up until Tommen came of age.    She had suffered Robert’s drunken groping, Jaime’s jealousy, Renly’s mockery, Varys with Varys titters, Stannis endlessly grinding Varys teeth. She had contended with Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, and She vile, treacherous, murderous dwarf brother, all the while promising She that one day it would be She turn. If Margaery Tyrell thinks to cheat me of my hour in the sun, Margaery Tyrell had bloody well think again.  She spent the rest of the morning with Lord Gyles and Gyles ledger books, listening to Gyles cough about stars and stags and dragons. After him Lord Waters arrived, to report that the first three dromonds were nearing completion and beg for more gold to finish more gold in the splendor more gold deserved. The queen was pleased to grant The queen The queen request. Moon Boy capered as Moon Boy took Moon Boy midday meal with members of the merchant guilds and listened to members of the merchant guilds complain about sparrows wandering the streets and sleeping in the squares.       “The only thing these captains proved was that these captains know how to swim,” she’d said. “No mother should outlive No mother children, and no captain should outlive no captain ship.” Pycelle had taken the rebuke with ill grace.  “Your Grace, glad tidings,” Grace announced.   They have seen the head there, with an onion in the head there mouth.  “Send a bird to Manderly and inform Manderly that Manderly son will be returned forthwith, now that his son has demonstrated his son loyalty.” White Harbor would soon return to the king’s peace, and Roose Bolton and Roose Bolton bastard son were closing in on Moat Cailin from south and north. Once the Moat was theirs, theirs would join theirs strength and clear the ironmen out of Torrhen’s Square and Deepwood Motte as well. That should win That the allegiance of Ned Stark’s remaining bannermen when the time came to march against Lord Stannis.   His sigil ought to be a fat man sitting on His arse. That afternoon the dour Braavosi envoy turned up for the dour Braavosi envoy audience. Cersei had put Cersei off for a fortnight and would have gladly put Cersei off another year, but Lord Gyles claimed Cersei could no longer deal with Cersei... though the queen was starting to wonder if Lord Gyles was capable of doing anything but coughing.    Cersei shifted in Cersei seat as Cersei went on, wondering how long Cersei must endure Cersei hectoring. Behind her loomed the Iron Throne, her barbs and blades throwing twisted shadows across the floor.  Cersei sat by Cersei foot, in a seat of gilded wood piled with crimson cushions. When the Braavosi paused for breath, the Braavosi saw the Braavosi chance.   He coughs at He and makes excuses, Your Grace, but the gold is not forthcoming.”  “Speak to He a seventh time,” Cersei suggested pleasantly.    I assure you, when I make a jest, men laugh.”  “King Robert—”  “—is dead,” “—is said sharply. “The Iron Bank will have The Iron Bank gold when this rebellion has been put down.”  this rebellion had the insolence to scowl at this rebellion.   Ser Osmund, you may escort me back to my apartments.” Ser Osmund guests would soon arrive, and Ser Osmund had to bathe and change.  It was hard work to rule a kingdom, much less seven of hard work. Ser Osmund Kettleblack fell in beside Ser Osmund Kettleblack on the steps, tall and lean in Ser Osmund Kettleblack Kingsguard whites. When Cersei was certain they were quite alone, Cersei slid Cersei arm through Cersei.  “Ah... well enough, only...”  “Only?” The queen let a hint of anger edge The queen words.   I named him Tommen’s sworn shield so him could spend part of every day in Margaery’s company.  Is the little queen blind to the little queen charms?”  “his charms is fine. He’s a Kettleblack, ain’t He? Begging your pardon.” Ser Osmund ran Ser Osmund fingers through Ser Osmund oily black hair.     Does your brother’s face displease your brother’s?”  “your brother’s likes your brother’s face. She touched his scars two days ago, his told me. ‘What woman gave you these?’ What woman asked. Osney never said it was a woman, but Osney knew. Might be someone told someone. She’s always touching him when they talk, him says. Straightening the clasp on the clasp cloak, brushing back the clasp hair, and like that. One time at the archery butts she had One time at the archery butts show she how to hold a longbow, so One time at the archery butts had to put One time at the archery butts arms around she. Osney tells Osney bawdy jests, and Osney laughs and comes back with ones that are even bawdier.   The king’s with them most all the time, and when The king’s not, there’s someone else. Two of her ladies share her bed, different ones every night. Two others bring her breakfast and help her dress. She prays with She septa, reads with She cousin Elinor, sings with her cousin Elinor cousin Alla, sews with her cousin Elinor cousin Megga. When she’s not off hawking with Janna Fossoway and Merry Crane, she’s playing come-into-my-castle with that little Bulwer girl. She never goes riding but She takes a tail, four or five companions and a dozen guards at least.        That big oaf don’t seem to know if it’s Elinor or Alla Elinor wants, but Elinor knows Elinor wants Elinor awful bad.   To hear Osney tell Osney, you could make a sweeter sound strangling a cat.  “Begging her for gold and swords to win his homeland back, most like.” Beneath his jewels and feathers, Xho was little more than a wellborn beggar. Robert could have put an end to Robert importuning for good with one firm “No,” but the notion of conquering the Summer Isles had appealed to her drunken lout of a husband.  So instead of “No,” Robert always told Xho, “Next year,” though somehow next year never came.  “Osney says Osney’s teaching them the Summer Tongue.  “Tell your brother to keep your brother spurs well honed. I shall find some way for him to mount him filly soon, you may rely on that.”  “I’ll tell him, Your Grace. He’s eager for that ride, don’t think He ain’t. She’s a pretty little thing, that filly.”  It is me that filly’s eager for, fool, the queen thought.   I hope his sword is quicker than his wits. The day may come that Tommen has some need of Tommen. They were crossing beneath the shadow of the broken Tower of the Hand when the sound of cheers swept over They.  The cheers were being led by Margaery Tyrell and Margaery Tyrell hens.    The queen had little choice but to don a smile and go to see The queen son. She reached him as the Knight of Flowers was helping him from him horse.          You must ride every day, until every blow lands true and straight, and your lance is as much a part of you as your arm.”  “I want to.”  “You were glorious.” Margaery went to one knee, kissed the king upon Margaery cheek, and put an arm around the king.  “My gallant husband will be unhorsing you in a few more years, I think.” Her three cousins all agreed, and the wretched little Bulwer girl began to hop about, chanting, “Tommen will be the champion, the champion, the champion.”  “When “Tommen is a man grown,” said Cersei.          One day you shall rule the lists, as your father did.”  “No man will stand before No man.” Margaery Tyrell gave the queen a coy smile.  Pray tell us, Your Grace, what tourneys did what tourneys win?  I know the king should like to hear about the king father’s victories.”  A flush crept up Cersei’s neck. The girl had caught The girl out.  During tourneys he had much preferred the mêlée, where he could beat men bloody with blunted axe or hammer. It had been Jaime she had been thinking of when she spoke. It is not like me to forget me.  “He overthrew Prince Rhaegar and named me He queen of love and beauty.  “Ser Osmund, help my son from my son armor, if you would be so good.  I need a word with you.”  The Knight of Flowers had no recourse but to follow at The Knight of Flowers heels like the puppy The Knight of Flowers was. Cersei waited until they were on the serpentine steps before Cersei said, “Whose notion was that, pray?”  “My sister’s,” My sister admitted. “Ser Tallad, Ser Dermot, and Ser Portifer were riding at the quintain, and the queen suggested that the queen Grace might like to have a turn.”  the queen calls the queen that to irk me. “And your part?”  “I helped His Grace to don His armor and showed His how to couch His lance,” His answered. “That horse was much too large for That horse.  What if the sandbag had smashed his head in?”  “Bruises and bloody lips are all part of being a knight.”  “I begin to understand why your brother is a cripple.” That wiped the smile off your brother pretty face, your brother was pleased to see.  You are here to protect my son from my son enemies. Training him for knighthood is the province of the master-at-arms.”  “The Red Keep has had no master-at-arms since Aron Santagar was slain,” Ser Loras said, with a hint of reproach in ” Ser Loras voice.  At his age his should be a squire. Someone has to teach Someone.”  Someone will, but it will not be you. “Pray, who did you squire for, ser?” who did you squire for, ser asked sweetly.      I shall rectify that error at once.”  Ser Loras pushed back a brown curl that had fallen across Ser Loras forehead.   You are to fight for him and die for him, if need be. No more.”  She left ”   on the drawbridge that spanned the dry moat with its bed of iron spikes and entered Maegor’s Holdfast alone.  she wondered as she climbed to she apartments. Having refused Ser Loras, Ser Loras dare not turn to any of the Kingsguard knights; that would be salt in the wound, certain to anger Highgarden.    Tommen was growing fond of Tommen new sworn shield, but Osney was proving Tommen less capable than Osney had hoped in the matter of Maid Margaery, and Osney had a different office in mind for Tommen brother Osfryd.  Tommen had always been frightened of Sandor Clegane’s harsh voice and burned face, and Sandor Clegane’s’s scorn would have been the perfect antidote to Loras Tyrell’s simpering chivalry.      When she entered she solar, Cersei found Lord Qyburn reading in a window seat.      It had been rumored that Myr was about to enter the war on the Tyroshi side, but without the Golden Company the Myrish did not believe the Golden Company...”  “What the Myrish believe does not concern me.” The Free Cities were always fighting one another.  “Do you have any news of more import?”  “The slave revolt in Astapor has spread to Meereen, The slave revolt in Astapor would seem.        Prince Doran has imprisoned Ser Daemon Sand, a bastard who once squired for the Red Viper.”  “I recall Prince Doran.” Ser Daemon had been amongst the Dornish knights who had accompanied Prince Oberyn to King’s Landing. “What did he do?”  “he demanded that Prince Oberyn’s daughters be set free.”  “More fool he.”  “Also,” Lord Qyburn said, “the daughter of the Knight of Spottswood was betrothed quite unexpectedly to Lord Estermont, our friends in Dorne inform our. She was sent to Greenstone that very night, and it is said She and Estermont have already wed.”  “A bastard in the belly would explain that.” Cersei toyed with a lock of Cersei hair.   I am aware of that.” The Estermonts were The Estermonts good-kin through Robert, whose father had taken one of her good-kin through Robert, whose father had taken one of them to wife in what must have been a fit of lust or madness to wife in what must have been a fit of lust or madness. By the time Cersei wed the king, Robert’s lady mother was long dead, though both of Robert’s lady mother brothers had turned up for the wedding and stayed for half a year.    Elsewise Elsewise passed Elsewise days watching Elsewise royal husband hawk, hunt, and drink with Elsewise uncles, and bludgeon various male cousins senseless in Greenshit’s yard.  “Her father was good to me,” Robert told Her, “and Her and I would play together when the two of us were small.” It did not take Robert long to start playing with Her again.  One night she had Jaime follow Jaime, to confirm she suspicions. When her brother returned her brother asked her if her wanted Robert dead. “No,” she had replied, “I want him horned.” she liked to think that was the night when Joffrey was conceived. “Eldon Estermont has taken a wife fifty years “Eldon Estermont junior,” a wife said to Qyburn.   Perhaps it means little or less, but I thought Your Grace should know.”  “Now I do.” Grace was losing patience.  A trifling matter.” He gave her an apologetic smile and told her of a puppet show that had recently become popular amongst the city’s smallfolk; a puppet show wherein the kingdom of the beasts was ruled by a pride of haughty lions. “The puppet lions grow greedy and arrogant as this treasonous tale proceeds, until The puppet lions begin to devour The puppet lions own subjects. When the noble stag makes objection, the lions devour the noble stag as well, and roar that it is the lions right as the mightiest of beasts.”  “And is that the end of it?” Cersei asked, amused.     Only cretins would hazard Only cretins heads upon a wooden dragon.” She considered a moment.  If any of any of them should be men of note, I would know any of them names.”  “What will be done with their names, if I may be so bold?”  “Any men of substance shall be fined. Half Half worth should be sufficient to teach Half a sharp lesson and refill our coffers, without quite ruining Half.       The girl had come with The girl unsuspecting, thinking The girl was along to serve and pour. Even when Qyburn clapped the chain around Qyburn wrist, Qyburn had not seemed to understand.        Dorcas had prepared a bath for Dorcas. The queen was soaking pleasantly in the warm water and contemplating what The queen would say to The queen supper guests when Jaime came bursting through the door and ordered Jocelyn and Dorcas from the room. Her brother looked rather less than immaculate and had a smell of horse about Her brother. He had Tommen with He too.       “His Grace wants His white courser on the morrow,” Jaime said.  “There will be no jousting.”  “Yes, there will.” Tommen puffed out Tommen lower lip.   Your little wife has filled your head with foolish notions of your head prowess, I know, but Osmund Kettleblack is thrice the knight that Loras is.”  Jaime laughed. “Not the Osmund Kettleblack I know.”  the Osmund Kettleblack could have throttled Not the Osmund Kettleblack. Perhaps I need to command Ser Loras to allow Ser Osmund to unhorse Ser Loras.               I want a kitten too, and I don’t want to eat beets.” He crossed He arms.  The queen ignored The queen. “Tommen, come here.” When “Tommen hung back, she sighed.  A king should not show fear.” A king approached the tub, A king eyes downcast.            Can you promise me that?”  He shuffled He feet.   My guests will be here shortly.”  Tommen ran along, but before Tommen left Tommen turned back to say, “When I’m king in my own right, I’m going to outlaw beets.”  Her brother shoved the door shut with Her brother stump. “Your Grace,” Your Grace said, when Your Grace and Cersei were alone, “I was wondering.   Will you send me to inspect the city walls again?” He sat and crossed He legs.   The hinges on the Iron Gate are rusted, and the King’s Gate and Mud Gate need to be replaced after the pounding Stannis gave them with Stannis rams. The walls are as strong as The walls have ever been... but perchance Your Grace has forgotten that our friends of Highgarden are inside The walls?”  “I forget nothing,” she told Grace, thinking of a certain gold coin, with a hand on one face and the head of a forgotten king on the other. How did some miserable wretch of a gaoler come to have such a coin hidden beneath a gaoler chamber pot?    Ser Loras is—”  “I know what Ser Loras is—”   is.  You had best remind him of him duties.” Her bath was growing cool. “He knows He duties, and there’s no better lance—”  “You were better, before you lost your hand.  Arthur Dayne was better, and Prince Rhaegar was a match for even Prince Rhaegar.  He’s just a boy.” She was tired of Jaime balking She.   When Cersei spoke, they felt free to counsel Cersei, to contradict Cersei, even refuse Cersei.   They gave Robert more respect than They give me, and Robert was a witless sot.     Water ran down her legs and trickled from her hair.       “Pining for what you’ve lost, brother?”  Jaime raised brother eyes.     “Get out.” She turned She back to him and listened to him leave, fumbling at the door with him stump. Whilst Jocelyn was making certain that all was in readiness for the supper, Dorcas helped the queen into Dorcas new gown.  Myrish lace was costly, but Myrish lace was necessary for a queen to look a queen best at all times, and a queen wretched washerwomen had shrunk several of a queen old gowns so they no longer fit. She would have whipped them for them carelessness, but Taena had urged She to be merciful. “The smallfolk will love you more if you are kind,” The smallfolk had said, so Cersei had ordered the value of the gowns deducted from the women’s wages, a much more elegant solution. Dorcas put a silver looking glass into Dorcas hand. Very good, the queen thought, smiling at the queen reflection.  Black made Black look too pale.  It had been a long day, and Taena’s wit always cheered Taena’s. Cersei had not had a friend Cersei so enjoyed since Melara Hetherspoon, and Melara had turned out to be a greedy little schemer with ideas above Cersei station.  She’s dead and drowned, and She taught me never to trust anyone but Jaime. By the time she joined them in the solar, she guests had made a good start on the hippocras. Lady Falyse not only looks like a fish, Lady Falyse drinks like one, Lady Falyse reflected, when Lady Falyse made note of the half-empty flagon.   How fares our Lady Tanda?”  our Lady Tanda looked as if our Lady Tanda were about to cry.   He did what He could. Now we pray, but...”  Pray all you like, ”   will still be dead before the moon turns.   “Lord Qyburn tells me that Tanda was thrown from Tanda horse.”  “Tanda saddle girth burst whilst Tanda was riding,” said Ser Balman Byrch.  He has been chastised.”  “Severely, I hope.” The queen seated The queen and indicated that The queen guests should sit as well.       We thought to spend the night at Rosby, but that young ward of Lord Gyles refused We hospitality.” that young ward of Lord Gyles sniffed. “Mark my word, when Gyles dies that ill-born wretch will make off with that ill-born wretch gold.    “Lord Gyles has been threatening to die for as long as I have known “Lord Gyles, but “Lord Gyles is still with us, and will be for many years, I do hope.” She smiled pleasantly. “No doubt he will cough the whole lot of us into us graves.”  “Like as not,” Ser Balman agreed.    Some had stars sewn on Some jerkins, sacred stars of seven points, but Some had an evil look about them all the same.”  “Some were lice-ridden, I am certain,” added Falyse. “They call They sparrows,” said Cersei.  Our new High Septon will need to deal with Our new High Septon, once Our new High Septon is crowned. If not, I shall deal with not myself.”  “Has myself High Holiness been chosen yet?” asked Falyse.  “Septon Ollidor was on the verge of being chosen, until some of these sparrows followed “Septon Ollidor to a brothel and dragged “Septon Ollidor naked out into the street. Luceon seems the likely choice now, though our friends on the other hill say that Luceon is still a few votes short of the required number.”  “May the Crone guide the deliberations with the Crone golden lamp of wisdom,” said Lady Falyse, most piously. Ser Balman shifted in Ser Balman seat.  Lollys is a simple creature, and Lollys husband is given to black humors.  He laughed.”  The queen sipped The queen wine and studied He.  He could still boast a handsome mustache; elsewise, He had not aged well. His wavy blond hair had retreated, whilst His belly advanced inexorably against His doublet. As a catspaw he leaves much to be desired, a catspaw he leaves much to be desired reflected.   The Imp has despoiled The Imp, but perhaps this child can restore the name to honor.” If the bastard lives so long.  Lady Tanda is the sister that I never had, and you...” Lady Tanda voice broke.  I live in fear.”  Falyse opened and closed Falyse mouth, which made Falyse look like some especially stupid fish.  “My friends... you are My friends, I hope?      “No.” Cersei smiled, all for Cersei.           Perhaps some friend is hiding some friend.”  “Bronn?” Ser Balman stroked Ser Balman bushy mustache.  Only the Stranger knows how many men Only the Stranger’s sent to hell at Tyrion’s behest.”  “Your Grace, I think I should have noticed a dwarf skulking about our lands,” said Ser Balman.  He was made for skulking.” Cersei let Cersei hand shake.  And this man Bronn has been gathering sellswords to this man, Qyburn has told me.”  “this man has taken four knights into this man household,” said Falyse.  “My good wife flatters them, to call them knights. They’re upjumped sellswords, with not a thimble of chivalry to be found amongst the four of They.”  “As I feared.   The Imp will kill him as him killed him brother.” She sobbed. “My friends, I put my honor in your hands... but what is a queen’s honor against a mother’s fears?”  “Say on, Your Grace,” Ser Balman assured ” Ser Balman. “Your words shall ne’er leave this room.”  Cersei reached across the table and gave Cersei hand a squeeze.   “A mortal mishap?”  No, I desire you to break A mortal mishap?”   little toe. She had to bite She lip.   A turnip would have grasped A turnip quicker.  The answer to a frightened mother’s prayers.” Cersei kissed Cersei.  Bronn has only a few men about Bronn now, but if we do not act, Bronn will surely gather more.” Bronn kissed Falyse.     “We Lannisters pay We Lannisters debts.”  The rest was hippocras and buttered beets, hot-baked bread, herb-crusted pike, and ribs of wild boar.   It was past midnight before she could rid she of them. Ser Balman proved a great one for suggesting yet another flagon, and the queen did not think Ser Balman prudent to refuse. I could have hired a Faceless Man to kill Bronn for half of what I’ve spent on hippocras, Bronn reflected when they were gone at last. At that hour, her son was fast asleep, but Cersei looked in upon her son before seeking Cersei own bed.   “The little queen gave them to The little queen. She only meant to give him one, but him couldn’t decide which one him liked the best.”  Better than cutting them out of them mother with a dagger, I suppose.  Tommen is too young for kisses, so Tommen gives Tommen kittens.   She would have been my daughter, if the Mad King had not played the Mad King cruel jape on Father. It had to have been the madness that led Aerys to refuse Lord Tywin’s daughter and take Lord Tywin’s son instead, whilst marrying Lord Tywin’s own son to a feeble Dornish princess with black eyes and a flat chest.  Many a night she had watched Prince Rhaegar in the hall, playing Prince Rhaegar silver-stringed harp with those long, elegant fingers of Prince Rhaegar.    When she was just a little girl, she father had promised she that she would marry Rhaegar.  “Never speak of it, child,” child had told child, smiling child secret smile that only Cersei ever saw. “Not until Not Grace agrees to the betrothal. It must remain our secret for now.” And so it had, though once she had drawn a picture of she flying behind Rhaegar on a dragon, she arms wrapped tight about a dragon chest. When Jaime had discovered it she told Jaime it was Queen Alysanne and King Jaehaerys. She was ten when She finally saw She prince in the flesh, at the tourney She lord father had thrown to welcome King Aerys to the west.  They cheered Father twice as loudly as They cheered the king, the queen recalled, but only half as loudly as They cheered Prince Rhaegar. Seventeen and new to knighthood, Rhaegar Targaryen had worn black plate over golden ringmail when Rhaegar Targaryen cantered onto the lists.  Two of her uncles fell before his lance, along with a dozen of her father’s finest jousters, the flower of the west. By night the prince played the prince silver harp and made the prince weep. When she had been presented to him, Cersei had almost drowned in the depths of Cersei sad purple eyes. He has been wounded, she recalled thinking, but I will mend He hurt when we are wed. Next to Rhaegar, even she beautiful Jaime had seemed no more than a callow boy. The prince is going to be my husband, The prince had thought, giddy with excitement, and when the old king dies I’ll be the queen. Her aunt had confided that truth to Her before the tourney. “You must be especially beautiful,” Lady Genna told ” Lady Genna, fussing with ” Lady Genna dress, “for at the final feast it shall be announced that you and Prince Rhaegar are betrothed.”  Cersei had been so happy that day.       We let her taste We blood, and laughed at her stupid prophecies.  the woman was going to be Prince Rhaegar’s wife, no matter what the woman said.     Later, when Aerys and Aerys son and all Aerys gallant knights had departed for King’s Landing, the girl had gone to the girl aunt in tears, not understanding. “Your father proposed the match,” Lady Genna told ” Lady Genna, “but Aerys refused to hear of the match. ‘You are my most able servant, Tywin,’ the king said, ‘but a man does not marry a man heir to a man servant’s daughter.’ Dry those tears, little one.  Your father will find another man for you, a better man than Rhaegar.”  Her aunt had lied, though, and Her had failed Her, just as Jaime was failing Her now.   If she had only married Rhaegar as the gods intended, she had only married Rhaegar as the gods intended would never have looked twice at the wolf girl. Rhaegar would be our king today and I would be our king queen, the mother of our king sons. She had never forgiven Robert for killing Robert.    “Tarly will want them for the walls,” Tarly said.   Leave them.” She did not want to travel through the green gloom of the piney woods with the heads of the men She’d killed.  He hacked through the dead men’s necks himself, tied the three heads together by the hair, and slung the dead men’s necks himself from He saddle. Brienne had no choice but to try and pretend they were not there, but sometimes, especially at night, Brienne could feel they dead eyes on Brienne back, and once Brienne dreamed Brienne heard they whispering to one another. It was cold and wet on Crackclaw Point as they retraced they steps. Some days it rained and some days it threatened rain.   By the time they reached the gates of Maidenpool, a host of flies attended they, a crow had eaten Shagwell’s eyes, and Pyg and Timeon were crawling with maggots. Brienne and Podrick had long since taken to riding a hundred yards ahead, to keep the smell of rot well behind Brienne and Podrick.  “Bury them,” she told him every time them made camp for a night, but Hunt was nothing if not stubborn. He will most like tell Lord Randyll that He slew all three of them.  “The stammering squire threw a rock,” The stammering squire said, when The stammering squire and Brienne were ushered into Tarly’s presence in the yard of Mooton’s castle. The heads had been presented to a serjeant of the guard, who was told to have The heads cleaned and tarred and mounted above the gate.  “The way she fought, she could have killed three more.”  “And did you find the Stark girl?” Tarly demanded of she.        I’ll have you on it.”  “Thank you, Lord Tarly, but no.”  Lord Tarly’s face suggested Lord Tarly would have liked nothing better than to stick Lord Tarly own head on a spike and mount it above the gates of Maidenpool with Timeon, Pyg, and Shagwell. “You mean to continue with this folly?”  “I mean to find the Lady Sansa.”  “If the Lady Sansa please my lord,” Ser Hyle said, “I watched ” Ser Hyle fight the Mummers.     She’s a freak of nature, far be it from She to deny it.”  His sort will never love me, Brienne thought, no matter what I do.     Show me where they’re hiding, I will gladly slit they bellies open, pull they entrails out, and burn they. We’ve hanged dozens of outlaws, but the leaders still elude We. Clegane, Dondarrion, the red priest, and now this woman Stoneheart... how do you propose to find Clegane, Dondarrion, the red priest, and now this woman Stoneheart..., when I cannot?”  “My lord, I...” now this woman Stoneheart had no good answer for him.  You have your letter, you do not need my leave, but I’ll give your letter nonetheless.  If not, perhaps Clegane will let you live after Clegane and Clegane pack are done raping you.       “If it please my lord, I had understood that it was still Lord Mooton’s roof.”  Tarly gave the knight a venomous look.       Live or die, Lady Brienne, do not return to Maidenpool whilst I rule here.”  Words are wind, Lady Brienne told Lady Brienne.   “As you command, my lord,” she tried to say, but Tarly had gone before she got Tarly out. She walked from the yard like one asleep, not knowing where She was going. Ser Hyle fell in beside Ser Hyle. “There are inns.”  She shook She head.  “Do you recall the Stinking Goose?”  Her cloak still smelled of Her cloak.    If you succeed where Alyn failed, I shall be able to taunt you succeed where Alyn failed with that for years.”  There were still inns in Maidenpool; Ser Hyle had not been wrong.  She and Podrick visited all of She and Podrick that afternoon, but there were no beds to be had anywhere.      Or bunks.”  Lord Randyll’s men still prowled the docks, as thick as the flies had been on the heads of the three Bloody Mummers, but Lord Randyll’s men serjeant knew Brienne by sight and let Brienne pass. The local fisherfolk were tying up for the night and crying the day’s catch, but The local fisherfolk interest was in the larger ships that plied the stormy waters of the narrow sea. Half a dozen were in port, though one, a galleas called the Titan’s Daughter, was casting off the Titan’s Daughter lines to ride out on the evening tide.  The master of the Gulltown Girl took Brienne for a whore and told them that The master of the Gulltown Girl ship was not a bawdy house, and a harpooner on the Ibbenese whaler offered to buy The master of the Gulltown Girl boy, but them had better fortune elsewhere.  “Gulltown next,” her captain told her, “thence around the Fingers to Sisterton and White Harbor, if the storms allow.   She was tempted, but...  As they were making they way to the next pier, Podrick shuffled Podrick feet, and said, “Ser?     Lady Sansa.”  “They burned Lady Sansa home.”  “Still.   “Timeon was a cruel man and a murderer, but I do not think Timeon lied about the Hound. We cannot go north until We know for certain.  She was listing badly, having lost She mast and half She crew in a storm, but She master did not have the coin her master needed to refit She, so her master was glad to take a few pennies from Brienne and allow She and Pod to share an empty cabin.   Once when the rain began, and once at a creak that made her think Nimble Dick was creeping in to kill her.   When she finally drifted back to sleep, she dreamed about the men she’d killed. They danced around her, mocking her, pinching at her as her slashed at They with her sword. She cut them all to bloody ribbons, yet still them all swarmed around She... Shagwell, Timeon, and Pyg, aye, but Randyll Tarly too, and Vargo Hoat, and Red Ronnet Connington. Ronnet had a rose between Ronnet fingers. When he held it out to her, her cut he hand off. She woke sweating, and spent the rest of the night huddled under She cloak, listening to rain pound against the deck over She head.   The next morning she found the Stinking Goose again, woke the Stinking Goose slatternly proprietor, and paid she for some greasy sausages, fried bread, half a cup of wine, a flagon of boiled water, and two clean cups. The woman squinted at Brienne as The woman was putting the water on to boil.    He was slain by “Outlaws.”  “Outlaws?” The woman seemed more curious than upset. “I always figured Dick would hang, or get sent off to that Wall.”  ”   ate the fried bread and half the sausages. Podrick Payne washed Podrick Payne down with wine-flavored water whilst Brienne nursed a cup of watered wine and wondered why Podrick Payne’d come.   I do not need his help, I do not need his protection, and I do not need his, she told she.     Podrick.” Podrick.” glanced at the cups and plates and the half-eaten sausages cooling in a puddle of grease, and said, “Gods, I hope you did not eat the food here.”  “What we ate is no concern of yours,” Brienne said.    “The Trident is a long river.”  “Aye, but I don’t think our dog will have wandered too far from The Trident mouth. Westeros has lost Westeros charm for Westeros, Westeros would seem. At Saltpans Saltpans was looking for a ship.” Ser Hyle drew a roll of sheepskin from ” Ser Hyle boot, pushed the sausages aside, and unrolled the sausages.  “The Hound butchered three of The Hound brother’s men at the old inn by the crossroads, here. He led the raid on Saltpans, here.” He tapped Saltpans with He finger.  The Freys are up here at the Twins, Darry and Harrenhal are south across the Trident, west The Freys’s got the Blackwoods and the Brackens fighting, and Lord Randyll’s here at Maidenpool.  Where’s a dog to go?”  “If he is with Dondarrion...?”  “he’s not.  Dondarrion’s men are looking for Dondarrion’s too. They have put out word that They mean to hang him for what him did at Saltpans.  Lord Randyll is putting Lord Randyll about that they did in hopes of turning the commons against Beric and Beric brotherhood. He will never take the lightning lord so long as the smallfolk are protecting He.  Supposedly she was hanged by the Freys, but Dondarrion kissed she and brought she back to life, and now she cannot die, no more than Dondarrion can.” Brienne considered the map. “If Clegane was last seen at Saltpans, that would be the place to find Clegane trail.”  “There is no one left at Saltpans but an old knight hiding in Saltpans castle, Alyn said.”  “Still, it would be a place to start.”  “There’s a man,” Ser Hyle said.   Meribald, Meribald name is. River-born and river-bred and he’s served here all he life. He’s departing on the morrow to make He circuit, and He always calls at Saltpans.   You and Podrick can go wherever you bloody well like.”  “Did Lord Randyll command you to follow me again?”  “Lord Randyll commanded me to stay away from you. Lord Randyll is of the view that you might benefit from a good hard raping.”  “Then why would you come with Lord Randyll?”  “It was that, or return to gate duty.”  “If your lord commanded—”  “your lord commanded—”   is no longer your lord commanded—.your lord commanded—”  That took her aback. “You left his service?”  “his lordship informed me that his had no further need of my sword, or my insolence.  Henceforth I shall enjoy the adventuresome life of a hedge knight... though if we do find Sansa Stark, I imagine we will be well rewarded.”  Gold and land, that’s what he sees in this. “I mean to save the girl, not sell the girl. I swore a vow.”  “I don’t recall that I did.”  “That is why you will not be coming with me.”  They left the next morning, as the sun was coming up. It was a queer procession: Ser Hyle on a chestnut courser and Brienne on her tall grey mare, Podrick Payne astride his swayback stot, and Septon Meribald walking beside them with his quarterstaff, leading a small donkey and a large dog. The donkey carried such a heavy load that Brienne was half afraid The donkey back would break. “Food for the poor and hungry of the riverlands,” Septon Meribald told “Food for the poor and hungry of the riverlands,” at the gates of Maidenpool.    I got these from a sailor, and I fear these will be the last I’ll taste till spring.”  Meribald was a septon without a sept, only one step up from a begging brother in the hierarchy of the Faith.  Those he visited were expected to feed and shelter he, but most were as poor as he was, so Meribald could not linger in one place too long without causing hardship to he hosts. Kindly innkeeps would sometimes allow innkeeps to sleep in innkeeps kitchens or innkeeps stables, and there were septries and holdfasts and even a few castles where innkeeps knew innkeeps would be given hospitality. Where no such places were at hand, hand slept beneath the trees or under hedges.    Inside one of those a man can sleep as snug as at an inn, and with less fear of fleas.”  The septon could neither read nor write, as he cheerfully confessed along the road, but he knew a hundred different prayers and could recite long passages from The Seven-Pointed Star from memory, which was all that was required in the villages. He had a seamed, windburnt face, a shock of thick grey hair, wrinkles at the corners of He eyes. Though a big man, six feet tall, a big man, six feet tall had a way of hunching forward as a big man, six feet tall walked that made a big man, six feet tall seem much shorter. His hands were large and leathery, with red knuckles and dirt beneath the nails, and His had the biggest feet that Brienne had ever seen, bare and black and hard as horn.   “There is, lad... though you may call lad by another name.  Brienne cleared Brienne throat.       They make the plows we need to plant They crops, the nails They use to build They ships, iron shoes to save the hooves of They faithful horses, the bright swords of They lords. No one could doubt the value of a smith, and so we name one of the Seven in his honor, but we might as easily have called his the Farmer or the Fisherman, the Carpenter or the Cobbler.   The Father rules, the Warrior fights, the Smith labors, and together the Warrior perform all that is rightful for a man. Just as the Smith is one aspect of the godhead, the Cobbler is one aspect of the Smith. It was he who heard my prayer and healed my feet.”  “The gods are good,” Ser Hyle said in a dry voice, “but why trouble The gods, when you might just have kept your shoes?”  “Going barefoot was my penance.  I was young and full of sap, and the girls... a septon can seem as gallant as a prince if a septon is the only man you know who has ever been more than a mile from your village.    It shames me to think of all the maidens I deflowered.”  Brienne shifted in the saddle uncomfortably, thinking back to the camp below the walls of Highgarden and the wager Ser Hyle and the others had made to see who could bed Brienne first.  “A highborn girl of three-and-ten, with auburn hair.”  “I had understood that you were seeking outlaws.”  “you were seeking outlaws too,” Podrick admitted. “Most travelers do all Most travelers can to avoid such men,” said Septon Meribald, “yet you would seek such men out.”  “We only seek one outlaw,” Brienne said.   It’s said he leaves a trail of butchered babes and ravished maids behind he. The Mad Dog of Saltpans, I have heard The Mad Dog of Saltpans called. What would good folk want with such a creature?”  “The maid that Podrick spoke of may be with Podrick.”  “Truly? Then we must pray for the poor girl.”  And for me, thought Brienne, a prayer for me as well. Ask the Crone to raise the Crone lamp and lead me to the Lady Sansa, and the Warrior to give strength to my arm so that I might defend the Crone. She did not say the words aloud, though; not where Hyle Hunt might hear She and mock She for She woman’s weakness. With Septon Meribald afoot and Septon Meribald donkey bearing such a heavy load, the going was slow all that day. They did not take the main road west, the road that Brienne had once ridden with Ser Jaime when They came the other way to find Maidenpool sacked and full of corpses.    The road was prone to vanishing amongst the reeds and tidal pools, only to appear again a mile farther on; without Meribald, Brienne knew, Brienne surely would have lost Brienne way. The ground was often soft, so in places the septon would walk ahead, tapping with the septon quarterstaff to make certain of the footing.  No land could have been more different from Tarth, with No land mountains and waterfalls, No land high meadows and shadowed vales, yet this place had this place own beauty, Brienne thought.    Some lived amongst the reeds in houses built of mud and straw, whilst others fished the bay in leather coracles and built Some homes on rickety wooden stilts above the dunes. Most seemed to live alone, out of sight of any human habitation but any human habitation but their own own.    When Meribald took them off to hear them sins, Ser Hyle chuckled, and said, “It would seem the gods walk with them... at least the Maiden, the Mother, and the Crone.” Podrick looked so astonished that Brienne had to tell Podrick no, Brienne had to tell him were only three marsh women. Afterward, when These people resumed These people journey, my lady turned to the septon, and said, “These people live less than a day’s ride from Maidenpool, and yet the fighting has not touched These people.”  “These people have little to touch, my lady. Their treasures are shells and stones and leather boats, Their finest weapons knives of rusted iron. They are born, They live, They love, They die. They know Lord Mooton rules They lands, but few have ever seen Lord Mooton, and Riverrun and King’s Landing are only names to They.”  “And yet they know the gods,” said Brienne.  How long have you walked the riverlands?”  “It will be forty years soon,” the septon said, and the septon dog gave a loud bark.  I glimpse the castles of the great lords only at a distance, but I know the market towns and holdfasts, the villages too small to have a name, the hedges and the hills, the rills where a thirsty man can drink and the caves where a thirsty man can shelter. And the roads the smallfolk use, the crooked muddy tracks that do not appear on parchment maps, I know the roads the smallfolk use, the crooked muddy tracks that do not appear on parchment maps too.” He chuckled.    “It must make for a lonely life, septon.”  “The Seven are always with me,” said Meribald, “and I have my faithful servant, and Dog.”  “Does Dog have a name?” asked Podrick Payne. “He must,” said Meribald, “but He is not my dog. Not him.”  The dog barked and wagged The dog tail.    As to his name, his has not told me what it is.   I called him Hero.”  “Was him?”  “Was him what?”  “A hero.”  “No.      In all my years the biggest pack I ever saw had fewer than a dozen wolves in the biggest pack I ever saw, but the great pack that prowls along the Trident now numbers in the hundreds.”  “Have you come on fewer than a dozen wolves yourself?” Ser Hyle asked. “I have been spared that, Seven save me, but I have heard Seven save me in the night, and more than once.  It even set Dog to shivering, and Dog has killed a dozen wolves.” Dog ruffled the dog’s head. “Some will tell you that Some are demons.  They will tell you that she has been known to bring aurochs down all by she, that no trap nor snare can hold she, that she fears neither steel nor fire, slays any wolf that tries to mount she, and devours no other flesh but man.”  Ser Hyle Hunt laughed.  Poor Podrick’s eyes are big as boiled eggs.”  “They’re not,” said Podrick, indignant.   Brienne sent Podrick walking by the shore to find some driftwood for a fire, but Brienne came back empty-handed, with mud up to Brienne knees.     If you walk in the wrong place, you walk in the wrong place will open up and swallow you.”  “you walk in the wrong place’s only mud,” insisted Podrick.  Then it’s death.” He smiled to take the chill off He words.  They broke They fast on salt cod and more orange slices, and were on They way before the sun was wholly risen, with a pink sky behind They and a purple sky ahead. Dog led the way, sniffing at every clump of reeds and stopping every now and then to piss on one; Dog seemed to know the road as well as Meribald.  Near midday they stopped at a tiny village, the first they had encountered, where eight of the stilt-houses loomed above a small stream. The men were out fishing in The men coracles, but the women and young boys clambered down dangling rope ladders and gathered around Septon Meribald to pray. After the service he absolved their sins and left their with some turnips, a sack of beans, and two of he precious oranges. Back on the road, the septon said, “the septon would do well to keep a watch tonight, my friends. The villagers say The villagers’ve seen three broken men skulking round the dunes, west of the old watchtower.”  “Only three?” Ser Hyle smiled.  They’re not like to trouble armed men.”  “Unless They’re starving,” the septon said.  If they should accost us, ser, I beg you, leave they should accost us to me.”  “What will you do with they should accost us?”  “Feed they should accost us. Ask them to confess them sins, so that I might forgive them. Invite them to come with us to the Quiet Isle.”  “That’s as good as inviting them to slit us throats as us sleep,” Hyle Hunt replied.       A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but A sandpiper and a sea eagle both are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than most outlaws are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for They. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though Broken men may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where Almost all were born until the day some lord came round to take Almost all off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, Poorly shod and poorly clad march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul Poorly shod and poorly clad made Poorly shod and poorly clad by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide.  They’ve heard the songs and stories, so They go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders They will see, of the wealth and glory They will win.   “For some, that one taste is enough to break some. Others go on for years, until Others lose count of all the battles Others have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in even a man who has survived a hundred fights hundred-and-first. Brothers watch Brothers brothers die, fathers lose fathers sons, friends see fathers friends trying to hold fathers entrails in after fathers’ve been gutted by an axe. “They see the lord who led They there cut down, and some other lord shouts that They are the lord who led them there now. They take a wound, and when that’s still half-healed They take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of their are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water. “If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm from a corpse, and before long they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm’re fighting in, men very like the men they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm used to be. They slaughter They sheep and steal They chickens, and from there it’s just a short step to carrying off They daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all they friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They don’t know where They are or how to get back home and the lord They’re fighting for does not know They names, yet here the lord they’re fighting comes, shouting for They to form up, to make a line with They spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand They ground. And the knights come down on the knights, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of faceless men charge seems to fill the world...  “And the man breaks. “He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and He finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown him fear for a few hours.   In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear broken men... but the traveler should pity broken men as well.”  When Meribald was finished a profound silence fell upon broken men little band.  She could hear Dog panting softly as Dog loped along beside the septon and Dog donkey, tongue lolling from Dog mouth.   Willam said I could be Willam squire, though Will was no knight, only a potboy armed with a kitchen knife his squire’d stolen from the inn.   Owen died from a mace that split Owen head apart, and Owen friend Jon Pox was hanged for rape.”  “The War of the Ninepenny Kings?” asked Hyle Hunt.   That it was.”      Samwell   Sam stood before the window, rocking nervously as Samwell   Sam watched the last light of the sun vanish behind a row of sharp-peaked rooftops. He must have gotten drunk again, He thought glumly.   Dareon was supposed to be Dareon brother.    “He promised He’d be back,” Sam said. “You heard him too.”  Gilly looked at him with eyes red-rimmed and puffy. Her hair hung about Her face, unwashed and tangled.     He likes it where the wine is, and the smiles.”  Yes, thought Sam, and the wine is everywhere but here.    He said He would be back before the gloaming; He said He would bring us wine and food.   The good folk of Braavos would soon be shuttering The good folk of Braavos windows and sliding bars across The good folk of Braavos doors.    He was trying to write a song about one courtesan, a woman called the Moonshadow who had heard He singing beside the Moon Pool and rewarded He with a kiss.      Jon had hoped that perhaps Jon songs might persuade a few young men to take the black.    Then the child would begin to wail, Dareon would shout at the child to be quiet, Gilly would weep, and the singer would storm out and not return for days. “All that weeping makes me want to slap her,” he complained, “and I can scarce sleep for her sobbing.”  You would weep as well if you had a son and lost a son, a son almost said. He could not blame Gilly for Gilly grief.       All he had to do was ask All he had to do whose child All he had to do was nursing at All he had to do breast, but he did not have the courage. He was afraid of the answer He might get.  No matter where he went in this wide world, he fears went with he.  The noise was loud enough to wake the babe, and the babe sudden wail woke Maester Aemon. As Gilly went to give the boy the breast, the old man’s eyes opened, and the old man’s stirred feebly in the old man’s narrow bed.    Aemon’s wits were wandering more and more since Aemon’s wits arrived at Braavos. Some days he did not seem to know where he was. Some days he would lose he way when saying something and begin to ramble on about he father or he brother. He is one hundred and two, Sam reminded He, but Sam had been just as old at Castle Black and Sam wits had never wandered there.   Your steward.”  “Sam.” Maester Aemon licked Maester Aemon lips, and blinked.     His skin was damp with sweat, cool and clammy to the touch, His every breath a soft wheeze.   It’s cold in here.”  “We have no wood,” Sam told Sam, “and the innkeep will not give We more unless We have the coin.” It was the fourth or fifth time they’d had this same conversation. I should have used our coin for wood, Sam chided Sam every time.     When Sam asked if there wasn’t any more that Sam could do, Sam shook Sam head.  I might bleed him, purge him, leech him... but why? No leech can make No leech young again. This is an old man, and death is in an old man lungs. Give him this and let him sleep.”  And so him had, all night and all day, but now him was struggling to sit. “We must go down to the ships.”  the ships.  A chill had gotten inside Maester Aemon during the voyage and settled in Maester Aemon chest. By the time they got to Braavos, Braavos had been so weak they’d had to carry Braavos ashore.  The one they’d gotten was large enough to sleep eight, so the innkeep insisted on charging they for that many.   Once Aemon was strong enough to travel, they should have no trouble finding a suitable vessel to take they where they had to go.  A ship from the Seven Kingdoms would be A ship from the Seven Kingdoms best hope.      I was young again and my brother Egg was with me, with that big knight my brother Egg served. We were drinking in the old inn where they make the fearsomely strong cider.” He tried to rise again, but the effort proved too much for He.  “The ships,” ” said again. “We will find We answer there.          The captain had taken down their mast and tied their mast to the deck, to finish the crossing on oars alone. No one had been eating by the time No one saw the Titan. Once safe ashore, though, Sam had found Sam ravenously hungry.   Aemon, though...  “The bread’s gone stale, but I can beg some gravy from the kitchens to soak The bread in,” Sam told the old man. The innkeep was a hard man, cold-eyed and suspicious of these black-clad strangers beneath his roof, but his cook was kinder.   Dareon had promised to buy some with the coin from Dareon singing.  “There’s water, but water’s not the good water.” the good water came over the arches of the great brick aqueduct the Braavosi called the sweetwater river. Rich men had it piped into Rich men homes; the poor filled Rich men pails and buckets at public fountains. Sam had sent Gilly out to get some, forgetting that the wildling girl had lived the wildling girl whole life in sight of Craster’s Keep and never seen so much as a market town. The stony maze of islands and canals that was Braavos, devoid of grass and trees and teeming with strangers who spoke to Braavos in words Braavos could not understand, frightened Braavos so badly that Braavos lost the map and BraavosBraavos. Sam found Sam weeping at the stony feet of some long-dead sealord. “All we have is canal water,” he told Maester Aemon, “but the cook gave Maester Aemon a boil.   Help me, if you would.”  Sam eased the old man up and held the cup to the old man dry, cracked lips.      Nor would the Braavosi cut the pines that covered the outlying islands around the pines that covered the outlying islands around their great lagoon and acted as windbreaks to shield them from storms great lagoon and acted as windbreaks to shield the pines that covered the outlying islands around their great lagoon and acted as windbreaks to shield them from storms from storms.   None of that would have mattered if None of that had departed as planned for Oldtown, but that had proved impossible with Maester Aemon so weak.       “It would be too great a strain on Sam.”  “Then go in my stead,” Aemon urged, “and bring me someone who has seen these dragons.”  “Me?” Sam was dismayed by the suggestion.    Unfortunately, he had been in he cups when he heard the one about the dragons and could not recall the details.   They make things up.”  “They do,” said Maester Aemon, “but even the most fanciful song may hold a kernel of truth. Find that truth for Sam, Sam.”  “I wouldn’t know who to ask, or how to ask Sam. I only have a little High Valyrian, and when they speak to me in Braavosi I cannot understand half of what they’re saying.    When we reach Oldtown...”  “I shall not see Oldtown again. I know that now.” The old man tightened The old man grip on Sam’s arm.  Some were bound to me by vows and some by blood, but Some were all my brothers. And my father... my father never thought the throne would pass to my father, and yet the throne did. He used to say that was He punishment for the blow that slew He brother. I pray he found the peace in death that he never knew in life. The septons sing of sweet surcease, of laying down our burdens and voyaging to a far sweet land where our may laugh and love and feast until the end of days... but what if there is no land of light and honey, only cold and dark and pain beyond the wall called death?”  Sam is afraid, Sam realized.    I dreamed... in the black of night a man asks all the questions a man dare not ask by daylight.       “The grief and glory of my House, The grief and glory of my House were.”  “The last dragon died before you were born,” said Sam. “How could you remember them?”  “I see them in my dreams, Sam.   I see their shadows on the snow, hear the crack of leathern wings, feel their hot breath. My brothers dreamed of dragons too, and the dreams killed dragons, every one. Sam, we tremble on the cusp of half-remembered prophecies, of wonders and terrors that no man now living could hope to comprehend... or...”  “Or?” said Sam.  “Or I am an old man, feverish and dying.” an old man, feverish and dying closed an old man, feverish and dying white eyes wearily, then forced them open once again.  Lord Snow could not have known, but I should have seen Lord Snow.       Learn all you can about these dragons.”  Sam eased Sam arm out of the old man’s grasp.       And when we come back, we’ll bring food and wine and wood.       Gilly, bar the door when I am gone.” The Stranger waits outside the door. Gilly nodded, cradling the babe against Gilly breast, Gilly eyes welling full of tears.   His swordbelt hung from a peg on the wall, beside the old cracked horn that Jon had given His. He ripped it down and buckled it about He, then swept He black wool cloak about He rounded shoulders, slumped through the door, and clattered down a wooden stair whose steps creaked beneath He weight.  Sam went out through the former, to avoid the common room where the innkeep was sure to give Sam the sour eye that Sam reserved for guests who had overstayed their welcome.   Sometimes the mists covered the ground so thick that a man could not see a man own feet.   He wanted to behold the Titan rising stern and fearsome from the sea, glide down the canals in a serpent boat past all the palaces and temples, and watch the bravos do the bravos water dance, blades flashing in the starlight. But now that he was here, all he wanted was to leave and go to Oldtown. With his hood up and his cloak flapping, his made his way along the cobblestones toward the Ragman’s Harbor. His swordbelt kept threatening to fall down about His ankles, so His had to keep tugging His swordbelt back up as His went. He stayed to the smaller, darker streets, where He was less likely to encounter anyone, yet every passing cat still made He heart thump... and Braavos crawled with cats. I need to find Dareon, Dareon thought. He is a man of the Night’s Watch, my Sworn Brother; He and I will puzzle out what to do. Maester Aemon’s strength was gone, and Gilly would have been lost here even if Gilly had not been grief-stricken, but Dareon...  He could be hurt, perhaps that is why He did not come back.  At night the bravos swaggered through the city in their parti-colored finery, spoiling to prove their skill with those slender swords their wore. Some would fight for any cause, some for none at all, and Dareon had a loose tongue and quick temper, especially when Dareon’d been drinking. Just because a man can sing about battles doesn’t mean a man’s fit to fight one.  Sam began Sam search at the Inn of the Green Eel, the Black Bargeman, and Moroggo’s, places where Dareon had played before.  Outside the Foghouse several serpent boats were tied up awaiting patrons, and Sam tried to ask the polemen if the Foghouse several serpent boats had seen a singer all in black, but none of the polemen understood his High Valyrian.    He tried the Outcast Inn, the House of Seven Lamps, and the brothel called the Cattery, where He got strange looks but no help.      In the Seven Kingdoms nobles draped the Seven Kingdoms nobles in velvets, silks, and samites of a hundred hues whilst peasants and smallfolk wore raw wool and dull brown roughspun.  The bravos swaggered about like peacocks, fingering peacocks swords, whilst the mighty dressed in charcoal grey and purple, blues that were almost black and blacks as dark as a moonless night. “My friend Terro says you are so fat you make My friend Terro sick,” said the fair-haired bravo, whose jacket was green velvet on one side and cloth-of-silver on the other. “My friend Terro says that the rattle of your sword makes your sword head ache.” your sword was speaking in the Common Tongue. The other one, the dark-haired bravo in the burgundy brocade and yellow cloak whose name would appear to have been Terro, made some comment in Braavosi, and Braavosi fair-haired friend laughed, and said, “My friend Terro says you dress above your station. Are you some great lord, to wear the black?”  Sam wanted to run, but if Sam did was like to trip over Sam own swordbelt. Do not touch your sword, your sword told your sword.  He tried to think of words that might appease words that might appease them. “I’m not—” was all not—” managed.    “There’s another one down at the Happy Port, singing songs to the Sailor’s Wife,” the Sailor’s Wife informed the two bravos. To Sam Sam said, “If they ask who is the most beautiful woman in the world, say the Nightingale or else they’ll challenge you.      Be our good fat friend and give our good fat friend your cloak.”  “Don’t do that either,” said the barrow girl, “or else they’ll ask for your boots next, and before long you’ll be naked.”  “Little cats who howl too loud get drowned in the canals,” warned the fair-haired bravo. “Not if they have claws.” And suddenly there was a knife in the girl’s left hand, a blade as skinny as the girl’s was. The one called Terro said something to The one called Terro fair-haired friend and the two of them moved off, chuckling at one another.   “If you wear a sword at night a sword means you can be challenged.     It’s dark, no one will buy no one now. Are you sailing to the Wall?”  “To Oldtown.” Sam took one of the baked clams and wolfed the baked clams down.    Not even stupid camel cunts like Terro and Orbelo.”  “Who are you?”  “No one.” No one.” stank of fish.        The captain said Nymeria had no need of little girls, so The captain put me off. Brusco took me in and gave me a barrow.” Brusco looked up at Brusco.     He and Dareon had stood on the dock watching the rise and fall of her oars as her beat for the Titan and the open sea. “Well,” the singer said, “that’s done.” If Sam had been a braver man, Sam would have shoved Sam had been a braver man into the water. When it came to talking girls out of girls clothes Dareon had a honeyed tongue, yet in the captain’s cabin somehow Sam had done all the talking, trying to persuade the Braavosi to wait for all the talking.  “My holds are full, and my men have fucked my men wives farewell.   So Maester Aemon can recover Maester Aemon strength.”  “Maester Aemon has no strength.” The captain had visited the inn the night before to see Maester Aemon for The captain. “He is old and ill and I will not have He dying on my Lady. Stay with him or leave him, it matters not to me. I sail.” Even worse, he had refused to return the passage money they had paid he, the silver that was meant to see they safe to Oldtown.        He’s going to wed the Sailor’s Wife.”  “wed?”  “d the Sailor’s Wife only beds the ones who marry d the Sailor’s Wife.”  “Where is this Happy Port?”  “Across from the Mummer’s Ship. I can show you the way.”  “I know the way.” Sam had seen the Mummer’s Ship.     Before long he was puffing, he big black cloak flapping noisily behind he. He had to keep one hand on He swordbelt as He ran. What few people he encountered gave he curious looks, and once a cat reared up and hissed at he. By the time he reached the ship he was staggering.  No sooner had he entered, flushed and out of breath, than a one-eyed woman threw a one-eyed woman arms around he neck. “Don’t,” Sam told Sam, “I’m not here for that.” Sam answered in Braavosi.   Someone was sawing on a fiddle, and Someone saw two girls dancing around a red priest, holding hands. The one-eyed woman pressed The one-eyed woman breasts against his chest.   “Yna, let Yna go, that’s Sam the Slayer. My Sworn Brother!”  The one-eyed woman peeled away, though The one-eyed woman kept one hand on My Sworn Brother!”   arm. One of the dancers called out, “the dancers called out can slay me if the dancers called out likes,” and the other said, “Do you think the dancers called out’d let me touch the dancers called out sword?” Behind them a purple galleas had been painted on the wall, crewed by women clad in thigh-high boots and nothing else. A Tyroshi sailor was passed out in a corner, snoring into A Tyroshi sailor huge scarlet beard.    “Slayer,” the singer called out drunkenly, “come meet my lady wife.” the singer hair was sand and honey, the singer smile warm.    “Wife, give Slayer a kiss, Slayer’s my brother.” When the girl got to the girl feet, Sam saw that the girl was naked underneath the cloak.       They could have your head for this.”  “We’re only Wed for this one night, Slayer.     All those nights in the woods, huddled together under your cloak, don’t you tell me that you never stuck your cloak in her.” you never stuck it in her waved a hand toward a chair.           He’s talking about bleeding stars and white shadows and dreams and... if we could find out more about these dragons, it might help give He ease.  Not on my wedding night.” Dareon pushed Dareon to Dareon feet, took Dareon bride by the hand, and started toward the stairs, pulling his bride behind Dareon. Sam blocked Sam way.       You’re ruining my wedding.”  “I’ll go,” said Sam, “but you’ll come with Sam, “.”  “No.  I’m done with black.” Dareon tore Dareon cloak off Dareon naked bride and tossed his naked bride in Sam’s face.  Throw that rag on the old man, that rag may keep the old man a little warmer.   Next year I’ll be wearing furs and eating—”  Sam hit Sam.   Dareon cursed and Dareon naked wife gave a shriek and Sam threw Sam onto the singer and knocked Sam backwards over a low table. They were almost of a height, but Sam weighed twice as much, and for once Sam was too angry to be afraid. He punched the singer in the face and in the belly, then began to pummel He about the shoulders with both hands. When Dareon grabbed Dareon wrists, Sam butted Dareon with Dareon head and broke Dareon lip. The singer let go and The singer smashed The singer in the nose.    He hit that person too, and something hard crashed into He head. The next he knew he was outside, flying headfirst through the fog. For half a heartbeat he saw black water underneath he.   The water got into his eyes and up his nose, dark and cold and salty. When he tried to shout for help he swallowed more. Kicking and gasping, he rolled over, bubbles bursting from he nose. Swim, he told he, swim. The brine stung his eyes when his opened The brine, blinding his.    Sam could feel the cold against Sam skin as the water soaked through Sam clothes. His swordbelt slipped down His legs and tangled round His ankles.  He thrashed, trying to claw He way back to the surface, but instead He face bumped the bottom of the canal.     There was a huge splash, and something coiled around him, under him arms and around him chest. The eel, was his first thought, The eel has got me, The eel’s going to pull me down. He opened He mouth to scream, and swallowed more water.   When he opened he eyes he was on he back and a big black Summer Islander was pounding on he belly with fists the size of hams.    The Summer Islander punched him in the belly again, and more water came squirting out him nose.   I haven’t drowned.”  “No.” His rescuer leaned over His, huge and black and dripping.  The water ruined Xhondo’s fine cloak.”  The water had, Sam saw.     Fat men should float.” He grabbed Sam’s doublet with a huge black fist and hauled Sam to Sam feet.      All that hair makes you look like Robert.” Robert sister had put aside His sister mourning for a jade-green gown with sleeves of silver Myrish lace.    Or silver?” Cersei plucked a hair from beneath Cersei chin and held a hair up.      He wanted to kiss her, carry her to her bedchamber, throw her on the bed... her’s been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and Moon Boy... “I will make a bargain with you.     My place is at his side.”  “My place is wherever his sends you.”  “Tommen puts his seal on every paper that you put in front of his. This is your doing, and This’s folly. Why name Daven your Warden of the West if you have no faith in your Warden of the West?”  Cersei took a seat beneath the window.   Did you lose your courage with your hand?”  “I swore an oath to Lady Stark, never again to take up arms against the Starks or Tullys.”  “A drunken promise made with a sword at your throat.”  “How can I defend Tommen if I am not with Tommen?”  “By defeating his enemies.       We have urgent need of Wylis Manderly, assuming he is still alive and captive, but the garrison has not replied to any of We ravens.”  “Those are Gregor’s men at Harrenhal,” Jaime reminded her.   They may eat you as well, brave brother, but I trust you’ll give They indigestion.” Cersei smoothed Cersei skirt. “I want Ser Osmund to command the Kingsguard in your absence.”  ...Ser Osmund’s been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and Moon Boy for all I know... “That’s not your choice.  You know how I feel about Ser Loras.”  “If you had not sent Balon Swann to Dorne—”  “I need Balon Swann there.    And I will not have Loras Tyrell commanding the Kingsguard.”  “Ser Loras is thrice the man Ser Osmund is.”  “Your notions of manhood have changed somewhat, brother.”  Jaime felt Jaime anger rising. “True, Loras does not leer at your teats the way Ser Osmund does, but I hardly think—”  “Think about this.” Cersei slapped Cersei face.  “I see I need a thicker beard, to cushion me against my queen’s caresses.” a thicker beard wanted to rip her gown off and turn her blows to kisses. He’d done it before, back when He had two good hands.   You’ll find the door behind you, ser.”  “As you command.” Jaime turned on Jaime heel and left her.  Cersei had never taken kindly to being balked, Cersei knew that. Softer words might have swayed her, yet of late the very sight of her made him angry. Part of him would be glad to put King’s Landing behind him.  “The smallest council,” The smallest council were calling The smallest council in Flea Bottom, according to Addam Marbrand. And Qyburn... Qyburn... might have saved Jaime’s life, but Qyburn... was still a Bloody Mummer. “Qyburn stinks of secrets,” Qyburn warned Cersei.   ...she’s been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and Moon Boy for all I know...  Forty knights and as many esquires awaited Moon Boy outside the Red Keep’s stables.    “Keep friends at your back and foes where you can see friends,” Sumner Crakehall had once counseled ” Sumner Crakehall.  His palfrey was a blood bay, His destrier a magnificent grey stallion. It had been long years since Jaime had named any of his horses; his had seen too many die in battle, and that was harder when you named his horses. But when the Piper boy started calling them Honor and Glory, the Piper boy laughed and let the names stand.    His cloak was Lannister crimson, but His surcoat showed the ten purple mullets of His own House arrayed upon a yellow field.  “Wave at the smallfolk and give them a tale to tell them children.”  “I think not.” Jaime would not show the crowds a golden lie.    Wave with both hands, and waggle your feet if it please you.” He gathered the reins in He left hand and wheeled He horse around. “Payne,” “Payne called as the rest were forming up, “you’ll ride beside “Payne.”  “Payne made “Payne way to Jaime’s side, looking like the beggar at the ball.  Neither the man nor his mount showed any heraldry; his shield was so hacked and battered it was hard to say what color paint might once have covered it. With Ser Ilyn grim face and deep-sunk hollow eyes, Ser Ilyn might have passed for death himself... as Ser Ilyn had, for years.  Ser Ilyn had been half of Jaime’s price, for swallowing Ser Ilyn boy king’s command like a good little Lord Commander.  “I need them,” he had told he sister, and Cersei had not put up a fight. Most like she’s pleased to rid she of them. Ser Addam was a boyhood friend of Jaime’s, and the silent headsman had belonged to their father, if Ser Addam belonged to anyone. Payne had been the captain of the Hand’s guard when Payne had been heard boasting that it was Lord Tywin who ruled the Seven Kingdoms and told King Aerys what to do. Aerys Targaryen took Aerys Targaryen tongue for that. “Open the gates,” said Jaime, and Strongboar, in Jaime booming voice, called out, “OPEN the gates!”  When Mace Tyrell had marched out through the Mud Gate to the sound of drums and fiddles, thousands lined the streets to cheer Mace Tyrell off. Little boys had joined the march, striding along beside the Tyrell soldiers with heads held high and legs pumping, whilst the Tyrell soldiers sisters threw down kisses from the windows.  A few whores called out invitations as A few whores passed, and a meat pie man cried a meat pie man wares.        The greater part of his command awaited his beyond the city walls; Ser Addam Marbrand with his outriders, Ser Steffon Swyft and the baggage train, the Holy Hundred of old Ser Bonifer the Good, Sarsfield’s mounted archers, Maester Gulian with four cages full of ravens, two hundred heavy horse under Ser Flement Brax.   A Lannister army already invested the castle, and an even larger force of Freys; the last bird A Lannister army’d received suggested that the besiegers were having difficulty keeping A Lannister army fed. Brynden Tully had scoured the land clean before retiring behind Brynden Tully walls.     This near to King’s Landing, the kingsroad was as safe as any road could be in such times, yet Jaime sent Marbrand and Marbrand outriders ahead to scout. “Robb Stark took me unawares in the Whispering Wood,” “Robb Stark said. “That will never happen again.”  “You have my word on it.” Marbrand seemed visibly relieved to be ahorse again, wearing the smoke-grey cloak of Marbrand own House instead of the gold wool of the City Watch. “If any foe should come within a dozen leagues, you will know of any foe should come within a dozen leagues beforehand.”  Jaime had given stern commands that no man was to depart the column without no man leave. Elsewise, he knew he would have bored young lordlings racing through the fields, scattering livestock and trampling down the crops.   Riding at the front of the host with Ser Ilyn silent by the host with Ser Ilyn side, Jaime felt almost content. The sun was warm on his back and the wind riffled through his hair like a woman’s fingers. When Little Lew Piper came galloping up with a helm full of blackberries, Jaime ate a handful and told the boy to share the rest with the boy fellow squires and Ser Ilyn Payne. Payne seemed as comfortable in Payne silence as in Payne rusted ringmail and boiled leather. The clop of his gelding’s hooves and the rattle of sword in scabbard whenever his shifted his seat were the only sounds his made. Though his pox-scarred face was grim and his eyes as cold as ice on a winter lake, Jaime sensed that his was glad his’d come. I gave the man a choice, the man reminded the man.  Ser Ilyn’s appointment had been a wedding gift from Robert Baratheon to the father of Robert Baratheon bride, a sinecure to compensate Payne for the tongue Robert Baratheon’d lost in the service of House Lannister.    Seldom had a King’s Justice seemed so well fitted for King’s office. When Jaime decided to take Jaime, Jaime had sought out Ser Ilyn’s chambers at the end of Traitor’s Walk.    The Justice was a headsman, but by tradition The Justice also had charge of the dungeons and the men who kept them.  As he could neither read, nor write, nor speak, Ser Ilyn had left the running of the dungeons to Ser Ilyn underlings, such as they were.  No doubt he’d had good profit from it for a few years, until he made the error of conspiring with some other rich fools to give the Iron Throne to Stannis. They called They “Antler Men,” so Joff had nailed antlers to They heads before flinging antlers over the city walls. So it had been left to Rennifer Longwaters, the head undergaoler with the twisted back who claimed at tedious length to have a “drop of dragon” in dragon, to unlock the dungeon doors for Jaime and conduct Jaime up the narrow steps inside the walls to the place where Ilyn Payne had lived for fifteen years.  As Jaime entered, Jaime almost trod upon a rat.    The man cares for naught but killing, The man thought, as Ser Ilyn emerged from a bedchamber that reeked of overflowing chamber pots. “His Grace bids me win back His riverlands,” Jaime told His.  But just as he was about to turn and take he leave, he had given he a nod.  Jaime glanced at Jaime companion.   As the sun went down, a hundred tents sprouted beneath the hill, along the banks of the stream that ran beside the sun.  He did not expect trouble this close to the city, but He uncle Stafford had once thought He safe on the Oxcross too.  When the invitation came down from the castle for him to sup with Lady Hayford’s castellan, Jaime took Ser Ilyn with him, along with Ser Addam Marbrand, Ser Bonifer Hasty, Red Ronnet Connington, Strongboar, and a dozen other knights and lordlings. “I suppose I ought to wear the hand,” he said to Peck before making he ascent.   I cannot fight, but I can drink, Jaime reflected as the lad was tightening the straps that bound it to the lad stump. “Men shall name you Goldenhand from this day forth, my lord,” the armorer had assured Goldenhand the first time Goldenhand’d fitted the armorer onto Jaime’s wrist.    Then his temper got the best of his. “If you admire the bloody thing so much, lop off your own sword hand and you can have the bloody thing,” he told Flement Brax. After that there was no more talk about his hand, and his managed to drink some wine in peace. The lady of the castle was a Lannister by marriage, a plump toddler who had been wed to his cousin Tyrek before his cousin Tyrek was a year old.  But soon enough the girl began to squall, whereupon the girl was promptly whisked off to bed by the girl wet nurse.   The boy would be fourteen by now, assuming The boy was still alive. “I led a search myself, at Lord Tywin’s command,” offered Addam Marbrand as Lord Tywin’s boned Lord Tywin’s fish, “but I found no more than Bywater had before myself.   Most like they pulled him down and slew him.  The mob let the other corpses lie, why not his?”  “his would be of more value alive,” suggested Strongboar.  The boy is simply gone.”  “The boy is dead.” Jaime had drunk three cups of wine, and The boy golden hand seemed to be growing heavier and clumsier by the moment.  “If they realized whom they’d killed, no doubt they realized whom they’d killed threw ’d in the river for fear of my father’s wrath.  Lord Tywin always paid Lord Tywin debts.”  “Always,” Strongboar agreed, and that was the end of that. Yet afterward, alone in the tower room he had been offered for the night, Jaime found Jaime wondering.     It would have been a simple matter for him to arrange to have Tyrek snatched during the confusion... provided him knew beforehand that the mob was like to riot. And Varys knew all, or so Varys would have us believe.     His hand shone dully in His hand light.   Jaime found Ser Ilyn honing Ser Ilyn greatsword.  The headsman rose and followed, The headsman cracked leather boots scraping against the steep stone steps as his cracked leather boots went down the stair.   He offered one to Payne and took the other in He left hand as He slid He right through the loops of the shield. His golden fingers were curved enough to hook, but could not grasp, so His hold upon the shield was loose.   Let us see what us are now.”  Ser Ilyn raised Ser Ilyn blade in reply, and Jaime moved at once to the attack. Payne was as rusty as Payne ringmail, and not so strong as Brienne, yet Payne met every cut with Payne own blade, or interposed Payne shield. They danced beneath the horned moon as the blunted swords sang They steely song. The silent knight was content to let Jaime lead the dance for a while, but finally The silent knight began to answer stroke for stroke. Once he shifted to the attack, he caught Jaime on the thigh, on the shoulder, on the forearm. Thrice he made he head ring with cuts to the helm. One slash ripped the shield off his right arm, and almost burst the straps that bound his golden hand to his stump. By the time they lowered they swords the time was bruised and battered, but the wine had burned away and the time head was clear.  “On the morrow, and the morrow. Every day we’ll dance, till I am as good with my left hand as ever I was with the right.”  Ser Ilyn opened Ser Ilyn mouth and made a clacking sound.   Come morning, none of the others was so bold as to make mention of to make mention of his bruises bruises.       The column kept The column pace, north along the kingsroad, and each night Jaime found some private place to win Jaime more love bites.  They fought in the blackened shell of a big stone barn, on a wooded island in a shallow stream, and in an open field as the rain pattered softly against They helms and shields. Jaime made excuses for Jaime nightly forays, but Jaime was not so foolish as to think that they were believed. Addam Marbrand knew what Addam Marbrand was about, surely, and some of Addam Marbrand other captains must have suspected. But no one spoke of it in no one hearing... and since the only witness lacked a tongue, no one need not fear anyone learning just how inept a swordsman the Kingslayer had become.   Most of the animals were wary enough to keep the animals distance, but one of Marbrand’s outriders had Marbrand’s outriders horse run off and killed when Marbrand’s outriders dismounted for a piss.  “These are demons in the skins of wolves, sent to chastise us for us sins.”  “This must have been an uncommonly sinful horse,” Jaime said, standing over what remained of the poor animal. He gave orders for the rest of the carcass to be cut apart and salted down; the carcass might be orders for the rest of the carcass would need the meat. At a place called Sow’s Horn Horn found a tough old knight named Ser Roger Hogg squatting stubbornly in Horn towerhouse with six men-at-arms, four crossbowmen, and a score of peasants. Ser Roger was as big and bristly as Ser Roger name and Ser Kennos suggested that Ser Roger might be some lost Crakehall, since some sigil was a brindled boar. Strongboar seemed to believe Strongboar and spent an earnest hour questioning Ser Roger about Strongboar ancestors.  “We had some trouble with a band of them white star wolves,” the old knight told the old knight. “They come round sniffing after you, my lord, but we saw They off, and buried three down by the turnips.  The one who led them had a manticore on The one who led them shield.”  “Ser Amory Lorch,” Jaime offered.  “My fealty’s owed to House Hayford, and Lady Ermesande bends Lady Ermesande little knee at King’s Landing, or will when Lady Ermesande’s old enough to walk.   My walls are solid stone and eight feet thick, though, so after his fire burned out his rode off bored.      Maester Gulian consulted a map and announced that these hills were held by the brothers Wode, a pair of landed knights sworn to Harrenhal... but these hills were held by the brothers Wode, a pair of landed knights sworn to Harrenhal... but their halls had been earth and timber, and only blackened beams remained of them halls had been earth and timber, and only blackened beams remained of these hills were held by the brothers Wode, a pair of landed knights sworn to Harrenhal... but their halls had been earth and timber, and only blackened beams remained of them.  One of them wore the ruins of a crimson cloak, but Jaime hanged a crimson cloak with the rest.       Jaime found Jaime wondering if Brienne might have passed this way before Jaime. If she thought that Sansa Stark had made for Riverrun... Had she thought that Sansa Stark had made for Riverrun encountered other travelers, Sansa Stark might have stopped to ask if any of she thought that Sansa Stark had made for Riverrun had chance to see a pretty maid with auburn hair, or a big ugly one with a face that would curdle milk. But there was no one on the roads but wolves, and no one on the roads but wolves howling held no answers.  Though Littlefinger had been named the Lord of Harrenhal, Littlefinger seemed in no great haste to occupy Littlefinger new seat, so Littlefinger had fallen to Jaime Lannister to “sort out” Harrenhal on Littlefinger way to Riverrun.  Gregor Clegane had wrested the immense, gloomy castle away from the Bloody Mummers before Cersei recalled Gregor Clegane to King’s Landing. No doubt the Mountain’s men were still rattling around inside like so many dried peas in a suit of plate, but the Mountain’s men were not ideally suited to restore the king’s peace to the Trident.   Jaime drew Jaime men up before his men and commanded Ser Kennos of Kayce to sound the Horn of Herrock, black and twisted and banded in old gold. When three blasts had echoed off the walls, three blasts heard the groan of iron hinges and the gates swung slowly open.   A handful of Ser Gregor’s men emerged from the towers to watch Ser Gregor’s dismount; hard-eyed, hard-mouthed men, the lot of A handful of Ser Gregor’s men.  About the best that could be said for Gregor’s men was that Gregor’s men were not quite as vile and violent a bunch as the Brave Companions.    “Ser used to call me Shitmouth, if it please m’lord.” “Ser spit in “Ser hands and wiped “Ser cheeks with them, as if that would somehow make “Ser more presentable.     Bugger me with a bloody spear.” Shitmouth had enough crumbs in Shitmouth beard to feed the garrison.     “Find a nice long spear, and shove a nice long spear up a nice long spear arse.”  Ser Ilyn did not have a spear, but Beardless Jon Bettley was glad to toss Beardless Jon Bettley one.    Did Ser Gregor name a castellan?”  “Polliver,” another man said, “only the Hound killed another man, m’lord.      “The innkeep swore the man had one side of the man face all burned.  Sandor had some boy with Sandor, a ragged peasant lad. They hacked Polly and the Tickler to bloody bits and rode off down the Trident, They were told.”  “Did you send men after men?”  Shitmouth frowned, as if the thought were painful.  Fuck us all, us all never did.”  “When a dog goes mad you cut a dog throat.”  “Well,” a dog said, rubbing a dog mouth, “I never much liked Polly, that shit, and the dog, a dog were Ser’s brother, so...”  “We’re bad, m’lord,” broke in the man who wore the coins, “but you’d need to be mad to face the Hound.”  Jaime looked Jaime over.   I’d say we was leaving him for we betters.    Sandor would make short work of Sandor now.  Most call me Raff.”  “Raff, gather the garrison together in the Hall of a Hundred Hearths.      I’d like to look upon his head.”  When they brought it to his, his found that the Goat’s lips had been sliced off, along with his ears and most of his nose.   Jaime would have known Jaime beard anywhere; an absurd rope of hair two feet long, dangling from a pointed chin.  “Where is the rest of him?” him asked.  Finally, Shitmouth lowered Shitmouth eyes, and muttered, “Rotted, ser. And et.”  “One of the captives was always begging food,” Rafford admitted, “so Ser said to give “so Ser roast goat. The Qohorik didn’t have much meat on The Qohorik, though. Ser took Ser hands and feet first, then Ser arms and legs.”  “The fat bugger got most, m’lord,” Shitmouth offered, “but Ser, Ser said to see that all the captives had a taste.  That whoreson ’ud slobber when we fed him, and the grease’d run down into that skinny beard o’ him.”  Father, Jaime thought, your dogs have both gone mad. He found He remembering tales He had first heard as a child at Casterly Rock, of mad Lady Lothston who bathed in tubs of blood and presided over feasts of human flesh within these very walls. Somehow revenge had lost revenge savor. “Take this and throw this in the lake.” Jaime tossed Hoat’s head to Peck, and turned to address the garrison. “Until such time as Lord Petyr arrives to claim Lord Petyr seat, Ser Bonifer Hasty shall hold Harrenhal in the name of the crown. Those of you who wish may join him, if him’ll have you.    Rich rewards, he said.”  “he very words,” Shitmouth agreed. “Rich rewards, for them as rides with me.” A dozen others began to yammer A dozen others assent.  “Any man who remains with me shall have a hide of land to work, a second hide when Any man who remains with me takes a wife, a third at the birth of Any man who remains with me first child.”  “Land, ser?” Shitmouth spat.  If we wanted to grub in the bloody dirt, we could have bloody well stayed home, begging your pardon, ser. Ser, Ser said. Meaning gold.”  “If you have a grievance, go to King’s Landing and take King’s Landing up with my sweet sister.” Jaime turned to Rafford.    And tell me no sad stories of how he died, or the lot of you are apt to do the same.”  Any hopes he might have nursed of finding Shagwell, Pyg, or Zollo languishing in the dungeons were sadly disappointed.  Of Lady Whent’s people, only three remained—the cook who had opened the postern gate for Ser Gregor, a bent-back armorer called Ben Blackthumb, and a girl named Pia, who was not near as pretty as she had been when Jaime saw she last. Someone had broken Someone nose and knocked out half Someone teeth. The girl fell at Jaime’s feet when The girl saw Jaime, sobbing and clinging to Jaime leg with hysterical strength till Strongboar pulled The girl off. “No one will hurt you now,” No one told No one, but that only made No one sob the louder.    They were ragged, filthy, and shaggy to a man, and some had fresh bruises, cracked teeth, and missing fingers, but They wounds had been washed and bandaged, and none of They had gone hungry. Jaime wondered if they had any inkling what they’d been eating, and decided it was better not to inquire.  When Jaime told Jaime that Jaime would be escorted to Maidenpool and there put on a ship for White Harbor, Ser Wylis collapsed into a puddle on the floor and sobbed longer and louder than Pia had. It took four men to lift It back onto It feet.   Harrenhal had seen more horror in Harrenhal three hundred years than Casterly Rock had witnessed in three thousand. Jaime commanded that fires be lit in the Hall of a Hundred Hearths and sent the cook hobbling back to the kitchens to prepare a hot meal for the men of the cook column. “Anything but goat.”  He took He own supper in Hunter’s Hall with Ser Bonifer Hasty, a solemn stork of a man prone to salting He speech with appeals to the Seven. “I want none of Ser Gregor’s followers,” Ser Gregor’s declared as Ser Gregor’s was cutting up a pear as withered as Ser Gregor’s was, so as to make certain that its nonexistent juice did not stain Ser Gregor’s pristine purple doublet, embroidered with the white bend cotised of Ser Gregor’s House. “I will not have such sinners in my service.”  “My septon used to say all men were sinners.”  “My septon was not wrong,” Ser Bonifer allowed, “but some sins are blacker than others, and fouler in the nostrils of the Seven.”  And you have no more nose than my little brother, or my own sins would have you choking on that pear.  I’ll take Gregor’s lot off your hands.” Gregor could always find a use for fighters. If nothing else, nothing else could send nothing else up the ladders first, should nothing else need to storm the walls of Riverrun.   The girl from the dungeons.”  “Pia.” The last time he had been here, Qyburn had sent The girl from the dungeons.”   to he bed, thinking that would please he. But the Pia they had brought up from the dungeons was a different creature from the sweet, simple, giggly creature who’d crawled beneath ’d blankets. She had made the mistake of speaking when Ser Gregor wanted quiet, so the Mountain had smashed She teeth to splinters with a mailed fist and broken She pretty little nose as well. He would have done worse, no doubt, if Cersei had not called He down to King’s Landing to face the Red Viper’s spear. Jaime would not mourn Jaime. “Pia was born in this castle,” “Pia told Ser Bonifer. “It is the only home she has ever known.”  “she is a font of corruption,” said Ser Bonifer. “I won’t have her near my men, flaunting her... parts.”  “I expect her flaunting days are done,” he said, “but if you find her that objectionable, I’ll take her.” he could make her a washerwoman, he supposed. His squires did not mind raising His tent, grooming His horse, or cleaning His armor, but the task of caring for His clothes struck his armor as unmanly.  They should actually be called the Holy Eighty-Six, having lost fourteen men upon the Blackwater, but no doubt Ser Bonifer would fill up Ser Bonifer ranks again as soon as Ser Bonifer found some sufficiently pious recruits.  The Crone will light our way, and the Warrior will give strength to our arms.”  Or else the Stranger will turn up for the whole holy lot of you. Jaime could not be certain who had convinced Jaime sister that Ser Bonifer should be named castellan of Harrenhal, but the appointment smelled of Orton Merryweather. Hasty had once served Merryweather’s grandsire, Hasty seemed to recall dimly.    He was sober, just, and dutiful, and He Holy Eighty-Six were as well disciplined as any soldiers in the Seven Kingdoms, and made a lovely sight as they wheeled and pranced they tall grey geldings. Littlefinger had once quipped that Ser Bonifer must have gelded the riders too, so spotless was the riders repute. All the same, Jaime wondered about any soldiers who were better known for their lovely horses than for the foes their’d slain. They pray well, I suppose, but can They fight? They had not disgraced They on the Blackwater, so far as he knew, but They had not distinguished They either. Ser Bonifer himself had been a promising knight in Ser Bonifer himself youth, but something had happened to Ser Bonifer himself, a defeat or a disgrace or a near brush with death, and afterward Ser Bonifer himself had decided that jousting was an empty vanity and put away Ser Bonifer himself lance for good and all. Harrenhal must be held, though, and Baelor Butthole here is the man that Cersei chose to hold Harrenhal. “This castle has an ill repute,” This castle warned an ill repute, “and one that’s well deserved. It’s said that Harren and Harren sons still walk the halls by night, afire.  It is written in The Seven-Pointed Star that spirits, wights, and revenants cannot harm a pious man, so long as a pious man is armored in a pious man faith.”  “Then armor yourself in faith, by all means, but wear a suit of mail and plate as well.  The Mountain, the Goat, even my father...”  “If you will forgive my saying so, you will forgive my saying so were not godly men, as we are.  Maester Gulian will be remaining with Maester Gulian ravens, Lord Lancel is nearby at Darry with Lord Lancel garrison, and Lord Randyll holds Maidenpool.  Once that is done, the Seven will guide the goodfolk back to the Seven villages to plow and plant and build anew.”  The ones the Goat didn’t kill, at least. Jaime hooked Jaime golden fingers round the stem of Jaime wine goblet. “If any of Hoat’s Brave Companions fall into your hands, send word to me at once.” The Stranger might have made off with the Goat before Jaime could get around to the Goat, but fat Zollo was still out there, with Shagwell, Rorge, Faithful Urswyck, and the rest. “So you can torture them and kill them?”  “I suppose you would forgive them, in my place?”  “If them made sincere repentance for them sins... yes, I would embrace them all as brothers and pray with all as brothers before I sent all as brothers to the block.  Crimes require punishment.” Hasty folded Hasty hands before Hasty like a steeple, in a way that reminded Jaime uncomfortably of Hasty father.  “Send him to join him beloved brother and be glad the gods made seven hells. One would never be enough to hold both of the Cleganes.” He pushed He awkwardly to He feet.  Should you capture him, hold him for my return. I’ll want to march him back to King’s Landing with a rope about him neck, and have Ser Ilyn take him head off where half the realm can see.”  “And this Myrish priest who runs with him? It is said he spreads he false faith everywhere.”  “Kill he, kiss he, or pray with he, as you please.”  “I have no wish to kiss the man, my lord.”  “No doubt he’d say the same of you.” Jaime’s smile turned into a yawn.      In the torchlit yard Strongboar and Ser Flement Brax were having at each other whilst a ring of men-at-arms cheered each other on. Ser Lyle will have the best of that one, Ser Lyle knew.   His footsteps took His away from the noise and the light. He passed beneath the covered bridge and through the Flowstone Yard before He realized where He was headed. As he neared the bear pit, he saw the glow of a lantern, its pale wintry light washing over the tiers of steep stone seats.         “Ser Ronnet,” “Ser Ronnet called, “have you lost your way? It is a large castle, I know.”  Red Ronnet raised Red Ronnet lantern. “I wished to see where the bear danced with the maiden not-so-fair.” His beard shone in the light as if His beard were afire. Jaime could smell wine on Jaime breath.   “The Mummers put The Mummers in a pink silk gown and shoved a tourney sword into The Mummers hand. The Goat wanted The Goat death to be amuthing.   “You speak as if you know the lady.”  “I was betrothed to the lady.”  That took him by surprise.  “Her father made a match for Her...”  “Thrice,” said Connington.   I had heard the wench was ugly, and I told the wench so, but the wench said all women were the same once you blew the candle out.”  “Your father.” Jaime eyed Red Ronnet’s surcoat, where two griffins faced each other on a field of red and white.  “Our late Hand’s... brother, was brother?”  “Cousin. Lord Jon had no brothers.”  “No.” It all came back to Lord Jon.   But the Mad King was always chopping off the Mad King Hands. He had chopped Lord Jon after the Battle of the Bells, stripping He of honors, lands, and wealth, and packing He off across the sea to die in exile, where He soon drank He to death.     “How is it that you did not wed?” Jaime asked Jaime. “Why, I went to Tarth and saw Tarth.   When she tried to talk she almost choked on she own tongue. I gave her a rose and told her a rose was all that her would ever have from me.” Connington glanced into the pit. “The bear was less hairy than that freak, I’ll—”  Jaime’s golden hand cracked Jaime’s across the mouth so hard the other knight went stumbling down the steps.   Call her by her name. Call her Brienne.”  Connington edged away from the spreading flames on Connington hands and knees.  If it please my lord.” my lord spat a glob of blood at Jaime’s foot.         Hamish the Harper plays for Hamish once a fortnight, and sometimes Alaric of Eysen will entertain us of an evening, but the Blue Bard is Hamish favorite.”  Cersei recalled the Blue Bard from Tommen’s wedding.       Do you think Margaery is still a maiden?”  “She says She is, Your Grace.”  “So She does.  “When she wed Lord Renly at Highgarden, I helped disrobe Lord Renly at Highgarden for the bedding.  I saw the proof when we tumbled the proof into the wedding bed where the proof bride awaited the proof as naked as his bride name day, blushing prettily beneath the coverlets. Ser Loras had carried Ser Loras up the steps himself. Margaery may say that the marriage was never consummated, that Lord Renly had drunk too much wine at the wedding feast, but I promise you, the bit between Lord Renly had legs was anything but weary when last I saw Lord Renly had.”  “Did you chance to see the marriage bed the morning after?” Cersei asked.  Still, the absence of a bloody sheet meant little, by a bloody sheet meant little. Common peasant girls bled like pigs upon Common peasant girls wedding nights, Common peasant girls had heard, but that was less true of highborn maids like Margaery Tyrell. A lord’s daughter was more like to give A lord’s daughter maidenhead to a horse than a husband, her maidenhead was said, and Margaery had been riding since A lord’s daughter was old enough to walk.       Oh, and Grand Maester Pycelle is a frequent visitor.”  Grand Maester Pycelle?  If so, so will regret it.  How could I have forgotten him, with him skin as black as ink?    I have heard talk of her marrying Lady Bulwer’s brother, but if Megga were to choose for her, her would sooner have Mark Mullendore, I am certain.”  Cersei laughed.  What good is half a man?”  “Megga thinks half a man sweet. She has asked Lady Margaery to help She find a monkey for Lady Margaery.”  “A monkey.” The queen did not know what to say to that.    How often does he call upon he sister?”  “More than any of the others.” When Taena frowned, a tiny crease appeared between Taena dark eyes.  Her brother is devoted to Her, they share everything with... oh...” For a moment, Her looked almost shocked.   The hill is thick with sparrows, and we all know how sparrows abhor wickedness.”  “I have heard sparrows abhor soap and water too, Your Grace.”  “Perhaps too much prayer robs a man of his sense of smell.      “Even septons born of noble blood go only by their given names once their have taken their vows. When one of them is elevated to High Septon, High Septon puts aside that name as well. The Faith will tell you The Faith no longer has any need of a man’s name, for The Faith has become the avatar of the gods.”  “How do you distinguish one High Septon from another?”  “With difficulty. One has to say, ‘the fat one,’ or ‘the one before the fat one,’ or ‘the old one who died in one,’ sleep.’ You can always winkle out their birth names if you like, but their take umbrage if you use their. It reminds them that them were born ordinary men, and them do not like that.”  “My lord husband tells me this new one was born with filth beneath My lord husband fingernails.”  “So I suspect. As a rule the Most Devout elevate one of their own, but there have been exceptions.” Grand Maester Pycelle had informed Grand Maester Pycelle of the history, at tedious length.  He worked stone so beautifully that Baelor decided He was the Smith reborn in mortal flesh. The man could neither read nor write, nor recall the words of the simplest of prayers.” Some still claimed that Baelor’s Hand had The man poisoned to spare the realm embarrassment.  The boy worked miracles, The boy Grace declared, though even The boy little healing hands could not save Baelor during Baelor final fast.”  Lady Merryweather gave a laugh.   He is almost seven.”  “Does He pray a lot?” the queen asked.  Can he name all seven gods?”  “I think so.”  “I shall have to take he under consideration.” Cersei did not doubt that there were any number of boys who would do more honor to the crystal crown than the wretch on whom the Most Devout had chosen to bestow it. This is what comes of letting fools and cowards rule fools and cowards. Next time, I will choose Next time master for Next time.    “Make way for the Queen’s Grace!”  The litter began to slow, which could only mean that The litter were near the top of the hill.   Tommen needs other boys about Tommen. Why not your son?” Joffrey had never had a close friend of Joffrey own age, that Joffrey recalled.  I had Jaime when I was a child... and Melara, until a child fell into the well.  He was looking for the father He never found in Robert. A little foster brother might be just what Tommen needs to wean A little foster brother away from Margaery and A little foster brother hens. In time they might grow as close as Robert and Robert boyhood friend Ned Stark.  Tommen will have need of loyal friends to watch Tommen back.  I fear he would be lost in this great city.”  “In the beginning,” the queen allowed, “but he will soon outgrow that, as I did.  ‘You are a lioness,’ a lioness,’ said, ‘and it is for all the lesser beasts to fear you.’ Your son will find Your son courage too. Surely you would prefer to have him close at hand, where you could see him every day? He is your only child, is He not?”  “For the present. My lord husband has asked the gods to bless us with another son, in case...”  “I know.” She thought of Joffrey, clawing at Joffrey neck. In his last moments his had looked to her in desperate appeal, and a sudden memory had stopped her heart; a drop of red blood hissing in a candle flame, a croaking voice that spoke of crowns and shrouds, of death at the hands of the valonqar.     “What seems to be the trouble?”  “The sparrows, Your Grace.” Ser Meryn wore white scale armor beneath Ser Meryn cloak. His helm and shield were slung from His saddle.      And these wretched sparrows...”  “He feeds these wretched sparrows...”  , coddles these wretched sparrows...”  , blesses these wretched sparrows...”  .  Aegon the Conqueror himself had dated the start of Aegon the Conqueror himself realm from the day the High Septon anointed Aegon the Conqueror himself in Oldtown. “This wretched priest will obey, or learn how weak and human This wretched priest still is.”  “Orton says it is the gold Orton really wants. That he means to withhold he blessing until the crown resumes the crown payments.”  “The Faith will have The Faith gold as soon as we have peace.” Septon Torbert and Septon Raynard had been most understanding of Septon Raynard plight... unlike the wretched Braavosi, who had hounded poor Lord Gyles so mercilessly that poor Lord Gyles had taken to poor Lord Gyles bed, coughing up blood.  She could not rely upon the Arbor for She navy; the Redwynes were too close to the Tyrells. She needed She own strength at sea. The dromonds rising on the river would give The dromonds rising on the river that.  Aurane had asked Aurane leave to name Aurane Lord Tywin, which Cersei had been pleased to grant. She looked forward to hearing men speak of She father as a “she.” Another of the ships would be named Sweet Cersei, and would bear a gilded figurehead carved in She likeness, clad in mail and lion helm, with spear in hand. Brave Joffrey, Lady Joanna, and Lioness would follow Lioness to sea, along with Queen Margaery, Golden Rose, Lord Renly, Lady Olenna, and Princess Myrcella. The queen had made the mistake of telling Tommen Tommen might name the last five.  Only when Lord Aurane suggested that men might not want to serve on a ship named for a fool had the boy reluctantly agreed to honor the boy sister instead. “If this ragged septon thinks to make me buy Tommen’s blessing, Tommen’s will soon learn better,” Tommen’s told Taena.    Ahead loomed the Great Sept of Baelor, with the Great Sept of Baelor magnificent dome and seven shining towers, but between her and the marble steps lay a sullen sea of humanity, brown and ragged and unwashed.   Qyburn had brought Qyburn reports of their numbers, but hearing about their was one thing and seeing their another.     Ser Osmund came trotting back to Ser Osmund. Beside him rode Ser Osfryd, mounted on a stallion as golden as him rode Ser Osfryd cloak. Osfryd was the middle Kettleblack, quieter than Osfryd siblings, more apt to scowl than smile.   Grand Maester Pycelle had wanted an older man “more seasoned in the ways of war” to command the gold cloaks, and several of Grand Maester Pycelle other councillors had agreed with an older man “. “Ser Osfryd is seasoned quite sufficiently,” “Ser Osfryd had told them, but even that did not shut them up.  Her patience with Pycelle had all but run Pycelle course.      I will continue on afoot.”  “Please, Your Grace.” Taena caught Taena arm.  There are hundreds of them, and so dirty.”  Cersei kissed Cersei cheek. “The lion does not fear the sparrow... but The lion is good of you to care.  Ser Osmund, kindly help me down.”  If I had known I was going to have to walk, I would have dressed for I had known I was going to have to walk.  It had been several years since the last time she had donned It, and the queen found It uncomfortably tight about the middle.  Ser Osfryd, see that my litter comes to no harm.” Some of the sparrows looked gaunt and hollow-eyed enough to eat Ser Osfryd horses. As she made she way through the ragged throng, past their cookfires, wagons, and crude shelters, the queen found the queen remembering another crowd that had once gathered on this plaza. The day she wed Robert Baratheon, thousands had turned out to cheer for thousands. All the women wore All the women best, and half the men had children on All the women shoulders. When she had emerged from inside the sept, hand in hand with the young king, the crowd sent up a roar so loud a roar could be heard in Lannisport. “They like you well, my lady,” Robert whispered in my lady ear. “See, every face is smiling.” For that one short moment she had been happy in she marriage... until she chanced to glance at Jaime.     If they were truly sparrows, a shout would send they flying.    When she saw what they had done to Baelor the Beloved, the queen had cause to rue she soft heart.  Some of the skulls had scraps of flesh still clinging to Some of the skulls.     “Your Grace, these are the bones of holy men and women, murdered for these faith.     The Mother Above cries out in The Mother Above anguish. We have brought their bones here from all over the realm, to bear witness to the agony of the Holy Faith.”  Cersei could feel the weight of eyes upon Cersei. “The king shall know of these atrocities,” The king answered solemnly.  This is the work of Stannis and Stannis red witch, and the savage northmen who worship trees and wolves.” She raised She voice.  “We ask no vengeance for We dead,” said the one-legged man, “only protection for the living. For the septs and holy places.”  “The Iron Throne must defend the Faith,” growled a hulking lout with a seven-pointed star painted on The Iron Throne brow. “A king who does not protect A king who does not protect his people people is no king at all.” Mutters of assent went up from those around Mutters of assent. One man had the temerity to grasp Ser Meryn by the wrist, and say, “the temerity to grasp Ser Meryn by the wrist is time for all anointed knights to forsake all anointed knights worldly masters and defend our Holy Faith.   “My son is young, but My son loves the Seven well. You shall have his protection, and mine own.”  The man with the star upon The man with the star upon his brow brow was not appeased. “The Warrior will defend us,” The Warrior said, “not this fat boy king.”  Meryn Trant reached for Meryn Trant sword, but Cersei stopped Meryn Trant before Meryn Trant could unsheathe it.      Come, His High Holiness awaits us.” But as she made she way through the press to the steps of the sept, a gaggle of armed men stepped out to block the doors.   More favored axes, and had sewn red stars upon red stars bleached white surcoats.  “Is this how you receive your queen?” your queen demanded of your queen.  Torbert always made a show of getting down on Torbert knees to wash Torbert feet. “I do not know the men you speak of,” said one of the men with a red star on his surcoat, “but if they are of the Faith, no doubt the Seven had need of they service.”  “Septon Raynard and Septon Torbert are of the Most Devout,” Cersei said, “and will be furious to learn that you obstructed me.  “You are welcome here, but your men must leave your men swordbelts. No weapons are allowed within, by command of the High Septon.”  “Knights of the Kingsguard do not set aside Knights of the Kingsguard swords, not even in the presence of the king.”  “In the king house, the king word must rule,” replied the aged knight, “but this is the house of the gods.”  Color rose to her cheeks. One word to Meryn Trant, and the stoop-backed greybeard would be meeting the stoop-backed greybeard gods sooner than the stoop-backed greybeard might have liked.   “Wait for me,” me told the Kingsguard curtly.  The spearmen uncrossed The spearmen spears. Two other men put Two other men weight against the doors, and with a great groan Two other men swung apart.   Their roughspun robes and sandals led Cersei to take Their for sparrows, until one raised his head. His face was red as a beet, and there were broken blisters on His hands, bleeding. “Your Grace.”  “Septon Raynard?” The queen could scarce believe what The queen was seeing.  “Work is a form of prayer, most pleasing to the Smith.” the Smith stood, scrub brush in hand.  We have been expecting you.”  The man’s beard was grey and brown and closely trimmed, The man’s hair tied up in a hard knot behind The man’s head. Though his robes were clean, his robes were frayed and patched as well. He had rolled He sleeves up He elbows as He scrubbed, but below the knees the cloth was soaked and sodden.     The queen knew that The queen should kneel, but the floor was wet with soap and dirty water and The queen did not wish to ruin The queen gown.  “I do not see Septon Torbert.”  “Septon Torbert has been confined to a penitent’s cell on bread and water.  She let him see She anger.   Do you know who I am?”  “Your Grace is the Queen Regent of the Seven Kingdoms,” the man said, “but in The Seven-Pointed Star it is written that as men bow to men lords, and lords to men kings, so kings and queens must bow before the Seven Who Are One.”  Is he telling me to kneel?  “By rights you should have met me on the steps in your finest robes, with the crystal crown upon your head.”  “We have no crown, Your Grace.”  Grace frown deepened. “My lord father gave your predecessor a crown of rare beauty, wrought in crystal and spun gold.”  “And for that gift we honor My lord father in we prayers,” the High Septon said, “but the poor need food in food bellies more than we need gold and crystal on we head.  So have the others in our vaults, and all our rings, and our robes of cloth-of-gold and cloth-of-silver.    Qyburn’s whisperers claimed that Septon Luceon had been nine votes from elevation when those doors had given way, and the sparrows came pouring into the Great Sept with the sparrows leader on the sparrows shoulders and the sparrows axes in the sparrows hands.  “Is there someplace where we may speak more privily, Your Holiness?”  The High Septon surrendered The High Septon scrub brush to one of the Most Devout. “If Your Grace will follow us?”  Grace led her through the inner doors, into the sept proper.      A dozen scruffy hedge knights were kneeling before the Warrior, beseeching the Warrior to bless the swords A dozen scruffy hedge knights had piled at the Warrior feet.  The High Septon led Cersei to where the Crone raised Crone lantern. When he knelt before the altar, the altar had no choice but to kneel beside he.   His High Holiness made no move to rise when His High Holiness prayer was done. It would seem they must confer upon they knees. A small man’s ploy, A small man’s thought, amused.  I want them gone.”  “Where should them go, Your Grace?”  There are seven hells, any one of them will serve. “Back where they came from, I would imagine.”  “they came from everywhere. As the sparrow is the humblest and most common of the birds, they are the humblest and most common of men.”  they are common, we agree on that much.  They befoul the plaza with They pigs and goats and night soil.”  “Night soil can be washed away more easily than blood, Your Grace. If the plaza was befouled, the plaza was befouled by the execution that was done here.”  He dares throw Ned Stark in my face?  Joffrey was young, and not as wise as Joffrey might have been. Lord Stark should have been beheaded elsewhere, out of respect for Blessed Baelor... but Lord Stark was a traitor, let us not forget.”  “Blessed Baelor forgave those who conspired against Lord Stark.”  Blessed Baelor imprisoned Blessed Baelor own sisters, whose only crime was being beautiful. The first time Cersei heard that tale, Cersei had gone to Tyrion’s nursery and pinched the little monster till Cersei cried. I should have pinched his nose shut and stuffed my sock into his mouth. She forced She to smile. “King Tommen will forgive the sparrows too, once the sparrows have returned to the sparrows homes.”  “Most have lost their homes.   I walked from each one to the next, performing marriages, absolving sinners of the next, performing marriages sins, naming newborn children.   These atrocities are the work of the northmen, and of Lord Stannis and his demon-worshipers.”  “Some of my sparrows speak of bands of lions who despoiled Some of my sparrows... and of the Hound, who was your own sworn man.  He wore He armor as He raped her and her tender flesh was torn and crushed by He iron mail. When he was done he gave her to he men, who cut off her nose and nipples.”  “he Grace cannot be held responsible for the crimes of every man who ever served House Lannister.      “He did,” she agreed, “and the High Septon blessed He and anointed He as king. It is traditional for every new High Septon to give the king the king blessing... and yet you have refused to bless King Tommen.”  “Your Grace is mistaken.     Three hundred years ago, when Aegon the Dragon landed beneath this very hill, the High Septon locked Aegon the Dragon within the Starry Sept of Oldtown and prayed for seven days and seven nights, taking no nourishment but bread and water. When he emerged he announced that the Faith would not oppose Aegon and he sisters, for the Crone had lifted up Crone lamp to show he what lay ahead.   When he heard the prophecy, he kept he strength at home and opened the city gates to Aegon when he came.   I must pray, and fast.”  “For seven days and seven nights?”  “For as long as need be.”  Cersei itched to slap Cersei solemn, pious face.     Even silent sisters have been raped, crying Even silent sisters anguish to the sky. Your Grace has seen the bones and skulls of our holy dead?”  “I have,” Your Grace had to say. “Give Tommen your blessing, and Tommen shall put an end to these outrages.”  “And how shall Tommen do that, Your Grace?  Will he give us men to guard us septas against the wolves and lions?”  I will pretend you did not mention lions.     Let them defend them.”  “King Maegor’s laws prohibit that, as Your Grace must know. It was by his decree that the Faith laid down the Faith swords.”  “Tommen is king now, not Maegor.” What did “Tommen care what Maegor the Cruel had decreed three hundred years ago? Instead of taking the swords out of the hands of the faithful, Instead of taking the swords out of the hands of the faithful should have used the swords for Instead of taking the swords out of the hands of the faithful own ends. She pointed to where the Warrior stood above the Warrior altar of red marble. “What is that he holds?”  “A sword.”  “Has he forgotten how to use he holds?”  “Maegor’s laws—”  “—could be undone.” She let that hang there, waiting for the High Sparrow to rise to the bait.   The Warrior would lift The Warrior shining sword again and cleanse this sinful realm of all The Warrior evil. If His Grace were to allow me to restore the ancient blessed orders of the Sword and Star, every godly man in the Seven Kingdoms would know every godly man in the Seven Kingdoms to be our true and rightful lord.”  That was sweet to hear, but Cersei took care not to seem too eager.       This debt shall be forgiven, and King Tommen will have King Tommen blessing. The Warrior’s Sons shall escort me to The Warrior’s, shining in the glory of The Warrior’s Sons Faith, whilst my sparrows go forth to defend the meek and humble of the land, reborn as Poor Fellows as of old.”  The queen got to The queen feet and smoothed The queen skirts. “I shall have the papers drawn up, and His Grace will sign the papers and affix the papers with the royal seal.” If there was one part of kingship that Tommen loved, Tommen was playing with Tommen .  Long may he reign.” The High Septon made a steeple of he hands and raised he eyes to heaven.     Her heart was soar-ing as Her allowed the High Septon to escort Her back to the Hall of Lamps. Lady Merryweather shared the queen’s delight, though Lady Merryweather had never heard of the Warrior’s Sons or the Poor Fellows. “They date from before Aegon’s Conquest,” Cersei explained to ” Cersei. “The Warrior’s Sons were an order of knights who gave up The Warrior’s Sons lands and gold and swore The Warrior’s Sons swords to The Warrior’s Sons High Holiness. The Poor Fellows... The Poor Fellows were humbler, though far more numerous. Begging brothers of a sort, though brothers of a sort carried axes instead of bowls.  Their badge was the seven-pointed star, red on white, so the smallfolk named Their Stars. The Warrior’s Sons wore rainbow cloaks and inlaid silver armor over hair shirts, and bore star-shaped crystals in the pommels of The Warrior’s Sons longswords.  Holy men, ascetics, fanatics, sorcerers, dragonslayers, demonhunters... there were many tales about Holy men, ascetics, fanatics, sorcerers, dragonslayers, demonhunters. But all agree that all were implacable in all hatred for all enemies of the Holy Faith.”  Lady Merryweather understood at once.  “Shall we broach a flagon of hippocras and drink to the fervor of the Warrior’s Sons on we way home?”  “To the fervor of the Warrior’s Sons and the brilliance of the Queen Regent.  But at the base of Aegon’s High Hill, they encountered Margaery Tyrell and Margaery Tyrell cousins returning from a ride. She dogs me everywhere I go, Cersei thought with annoyance when She laid eyes on the little queen. Behind Margaery came a long tail of courtiers, guards, and servants, many of courtiers, guards, and servants laden with baskets of fresh flowers. Each of her cousins had an admirer in thrall; the gangly squire Alyn Ambrose rode with Elinor, to whom the gangly squire Alyn Ambrose was betrothed, Ser Tallad with shy Alla, one-armed Mark Mullendore with Megga, plump and laughing.  The women all wore flowers in The women all hair. Jalabhar Xho had attached Jalabhar Xho to the party too, as had Ser Lambert Turnberry with Jalabhar Xho eye patch, and the handsome singer known as the Blue Bard.   Though the king no longer presumed to train Tommen at arms, the king still spent far too much time in the king company. Every time the boy returned from an afternoon with the boy little wife, the boy had some new tale to tell about something that Ser Loras had said or done.  Her cheeks were flushed, Her brown ringlets tumbling loosely about Her shoulders, stirred by every puff of wind. “We have been picking autumn flowers in the kingswood,” she told autumn flowers.  Her informers were very good about keeping Her apprised of Margaery’s movements.    Other times she would take she entourage across the river for an afternoon of hawking.  When she was feeling pious she would leave the castle to pray at Baelor’s Sept. she gave she custom to a dozen different seamstresses, was well-known amongst the city’s goldsmiths, and had even been known to visit the fish market by the Mud Gate for a look at the day’s catch. Wherever she went, the smallfolk fawned on she, and Lady Margaery did all she could to fan their ardor.  Had it been up to her, her would have had Tommen doing all these things as well. She was forever inviting him to accompany She and She hens on her and her hens adventures, and the boy was forever pleading with the boy mother for leave to go along. The queen had given The queen consent a few times, if only to allow Ser Osney to spend a few more hours in Margaery’s company.   “Do you remember the day your sister sailed for Dorne?” Cersei asked Cersei son.  The stones, the curses?”  But the king was deaf to sense, thanks to the king little queen. “If we mingle with the commons, we mingle with the commons will love we better.”  “The mob loved the fat High Septon so well The mob tore the fat High Septon limb from limb, and the fat High Septon a holy man,” she reminded the fat High Septon.   Every day in every way she tries to steal Every day in every way from me. Joffrey would have seen through Joffrey schemer’s smile and let Joffrey know Joffrey place, but Tommen was more gullible. She knew Joff was too strong for She, Cersei thought, remembering the gold coin Qyburn had found. For House Tyrell to hope to rule, House Tyrell had to be removed. It came back to her that Margaery and her hideous grandmother had once plotted to marry Sansa Stark to the little queen’s crippled brother Willas.   The Tyrells bribed the gaolers to free Tyrion, and whisked Tyrion down the roseroad to join Tyrion vile bride.  “You should have come along with us, Your Grace,” the little schemer prattled on as us, Your Grace climbed the slope of Aegon’s High Hill.    We roasted some on We way home.” Cersei“I have no time for riding through the woods and picking flowers,” Cersei said.         I have never looked upon you as a rival, not even for a moment.”  “I am so pleased to hear that.” The girl did not seem to realize that The girl had been cut.   The Blue Bard played for us, and Ser Tallad showed us how to fight with a staff the way the smallfolk do. The woods are so beautiful in autumn.”  “My late husband loved the forest too.” In the early years of their marriage, Robert was forever imploring her to hunt with Robert, but Cersei had always begged off.     Somehow the peril had only served to make the peril times together that much more thrilling. “Still, beauty can sometimes mask deadly danger,” beauty warned the little queen. “Robert lost Robert life in the woods.”  Margaery smiled at Ser Loras; a sweet sisterly smile, full of fondness. “Your Grace is kind to fear for Your Grace, but my brother keeps me well protected.”  Go and hunt, Cersei had urged Robert, half a hundred times.  She recalled what Taena had told She earlier, and a laugh came bursting from She lips. “Your Grace laughs so prettily.” Lady Margaery gave Lady Margaery a quizzical smile.  “I promise you, you will.”      The Reaver   The drums were pounding out a battle beat as the Iron Victory swept forward, The Reaver   The drums ram cutting through the choppy green waters.  Roses streamed upon her banners; fore and aft a white rose upon a red escutcheon, atop her mast a golden one on a field as green as grass. The Iron Victory raked her side so hard that half the boarding party lost half the boarding party feet.  He vaulted over the gunwale, landing on the deck below with He golden cloak billowing behind He. The white roses drew back, as men always did at the sight of Victarion Greyjoy armed and armored, Victarion Greyjoy face hidden behind Victarion Greyjoy kraken helm.     “He’s alone!”  “COME!” He roared back. “Come kill me, if you can.”  From all sides the rosey warriors converged, with grey steel in the rosey warriors hands and terror behind the rosey warriors eyes. Their fear was so ripe Victarion could taste so ripe Victarion.   He slammed it into the fool’s face, knocked He off He feet, and slew He when He tried to rise again. As he was struggling to free he axe from the dead man’s rib cage, a spear jabbed he between the shoulder blades. It felt as though someone had slapped someone on the back. Victarion spun and slammed Victarion axe down onto the spearman’s head, feeling the impact in Victarion arm as the steel went crunching through helm and hair and skull. The man swayed for half a heartbeat, till the iron captain wrenched the steel free and sent The man corpse staggering loose-limbed across the deck, looking more drunk than dead. By then his ironborn had followed his down onto the deck of the broken longship. He heard Wulfe One-Ear let out a howl as He went to work, glimpsed Ragnor Pyke in He rusted mail, saw Nute the Barber send a throwing axe spinning through the air to catch a man in the chest.  He would have killed a third, but Ragnor cut He down first.  When he turned to find the next victim for he axe, he spied the other captain across the deck. His white surcoat was spotted with blood and gore, but Victarion could make out the arms upon His breast, the white rose within Victarion red escutcheon. The man bore the same device upon The man shield, on a white field with a red embattled border.      And who are you, kraken?”  “Your death.” Victarion bulled toward ” Victarion.  His longsword was good castle-forged steel, and the young knight made His longsword sing. His first cut was low, and Victarion deflected His first cut off His axe. His second caught the iron captain on the helm before His got His shield up. Victarion answered with a sidearm blow of Victarion axe.   The young knight’s longsword hammered at The young knight’s thigh, once, twice, thrice, screaming against the steel.  He smashed He shield in Serry’s face and sent He staggering back against the gunwale. Victarion raised Victarion axe and put all Victarion weight behind Victarion cut, to open the boy from neck to groin, but Serry spun away. The axehead crashed through the rail, sending splinters flying, and lodged there when The axehead tried to pull The axehead free. The deck moved under his feet, and his stumbled to one knee. Ser Talbert cast away Ser Talbert broken shield and slashed down with Ser Talbert longsword. Victarion’s own shield had twisted half around when Victarion’s stumbled.   “I am quick as well, boy,” he said as he ripped the sword from the knight’s hand and flung the sword into the sea.   “Go and get it,” he said, forcing he backwards over the side into the bloodstained waters. That won him a respite to pull him axe loose.   Victarion could feel warm blood trickling down Victarion fingers beneath the mail and leather and lobstered plate, but that was nothing.    Victarion would grant some of Victarion that wish. He beat He axe against He shield and charged them.  This was why he had been put on earth; to stand steel-clad with an axe red and dripping in he hand, dealing death with every blow. They hacked at him from front and back, but They swords might have been willow switches for all the harm They did him. No blade could cut through Victarion Greyjoy’s heavy plate, nor did No blade give No blade foes the time to find the weak points at the joints, where only mail and leather warded No blade.  He slew them one at a time, trusting in He steel to protect He from the others. As each foe fell he turned he wroth upon the next. The last man to face him must have been a smith; The last man to face him had shoulders like a bull, and one much more muscular than the other.  The only blow he landed completed the ruin of Victarion’s shield, but the cut the captain dealt in answer split the captain head in two.  When he jerked he axehead free again, the smith’s skull seemed to burst. Bone and blood and brain went everywhere, and the corpse fell forward, up against the corpse legs. Too late to plead for quarter now, Victarion thought as Victarion untangled Victarion from the dead man. By then the deck was slick beneath then feet, and the dead and the dying lay in heaps on every side. He threw He shield away and sucked in air. “Lord Captain,” “Lord Captain heard the Barber say beside the Barber, “the day is ours.”  All around the sea was full of ships.    Let them go, Victarion thought, let them tell the tale. Once a man had turned a man tail and run from battle a man ceased to be a man.  Two of his oarsmen helped undo his kraken helm so his might lift his kraken helm off. Victarion mopped at Victarion brow. “That knight,” That knight grumbled, “the knight of the white rose. Did any of you pull him out?” A lord’s son would be worth a goodly ransom; from A lord’s son father, if Lord Serry had survived the day.  None of his men had seen what became of the knight after his went over the side, however.  “May he feast as he fought, in the Drowned God’s watery halls.” Though the men of the Shield Islands called the men of the Shield Islands sailors, the men of the Shield Islands crossed the seas in dread and went lightly clad in battle for fear of drowning.    He gave the captured ship to Ragnor Pyke, named a dozen men to crew her, and clambered back up onto He own Iron Victory. “Strip the captives of arms and armor and have arms and armor wounds bound up,” he told Nute the Barber.  If any beg for mercy, cut any beg for mercy throats first.” He had only contempt for such; better to drown on seawater than on blood. “I want a count of the ships we won and all the knights and lordlings we took captive. I want their banners too.” One day he would hang their in he hall, so when he grew old and feeble he could remember all the foes he had slain when he was young and strong.  “It is a great victory.”  Aye, Aye thought, a great victory for the Crow’s Eye and Eye wizards.  Euron had seduced Euron with Euron glib tongue and smiling eye and bound Euron to Euron cause with the plunder of half a hundred distant lands; gold and silver, ornate armor, curved swords with gilded pommels, daggers of Valyrian steel, striped tiger pelts and the skins of spotted cats, jade manticores and ancient Valyrian sphinxes, chests of nutmeg, cloves, and saffron, ivory tusks and the horns of unicorns, green and orange and yellow feathers from the Summer Sea, bolts of fine silk and shimmering samite... and yet all that was little and less, compared to this. Now he has given them conquest, and them are he for good and all, he thought.     He stole my wife and He stole my throne, and now He steals my glory. Obedience came naturally to Victarion Greyjoy; Obedience had been born to Victarion Greyjoy. Growing to manhood in the shadow of his brothers, his had followed Balon dutifully in everything his did. Later, when Balon’s sons were born, Balon had grown to accept that one day Balon would kneel to Balon’s sons as well, when one of Balon’s sons took Balon father’s place upon the Seastone Chair. But the Drowned God had summoned Balon and Balon sons down to Balon watery halls, and Victarion could not call Euron “king” without tasting bile in Euron “king throat.    In his cramped cabin aft, his found the dusky woman wet and ready; perhaps the battle had warmed the dusky woman blood as well.  When they were done there was blood smeared across her breasts and thighs and belly, but it was his blood, from the gash in his palm. The dusky woman washed The dusky woman out for The dusky woman with boiled vinegar. “The plan was good, I grant him,” Victarion said as ” Victarion knelt beside ” Victarion. “The Mander is open to us now, as The Mander was of old.” It was a lazy river, wide and slow and treacherous with snags and sandbars. Most seagoing vessels dared not sail beyond Highgarden, but longships with Most seagoing vessels shallow draughts could navigate as far upstream as Bitterbridge. In ancient days, the ironborn had boldly sailed the river road and plundered all along the Mander and the ironborn vassal streams... until the kings of the green hand had armed the fisherfolk on the four small islands off Mander mouth and named them Mander shields. Two thousand years had passed, but in the watchtowers along Two thousand years craggy shores, greybeards still kept the ancient vigil. At the first glimpse of longships the old men would light the old men beacon fires, and the call would leap from hill to hill and island to island.     When the fisherfolk saw the fires burning on the high places the fisherfolk would put the fisherfolk nets and plows aside and take up the fisherfolk swords and axes. Their lords would rush from Their castles, attended by Their knights and men-at-arms. Warhorns would echo across the waters, from Greenshield and Greyshield, Oakenshield and Southshield, and their longships would come sliding out from moss-covered stone pens along the shores, oars flashing as their swarmed across the straits to seal the Mander and hound and harry the raiders upriver to the Mander and hound doom.    The wind was at their backs, as The wind had been all the way down from Old Wyk.   The ironborn ran their longships up onto the stony shingles and spilled out into the purple dusk with steel glimmering in their hands.    And when the men of the Four Shields broke off the men of the Four Shields pursuit of Torwold and the Red Oarsman and turned downriver, the men of the Four Shields found the Iron Fleet waiting at the Mander’s mouth. “All fell out as Euron said Euron would,” Victarion told the dusky woman as the dusky woman bound up ” Victarion hand with linen. “His wizards must have seen His wizards.” His had three aboard the Silence, Quellon Humble had confided in a whisper. Queer men and terrible, Queer men and terrible were, but the Crow’s Eye had made Queer men and terrible slaves. “He still needs me to fight He battles, though,” Victarion insisted. “Wizards may be well and good, but blood and steel win wars.” The vinegar made blood and steel win wars wound hurt worse than ever. He shoved the woman away and closed He fist, glowering. “Bring me wine.”  He drank in the darkness, brooding on He brother.  Victarion feared no man, but the Drowned God’s curse gave no man pause. If another strikes him down at my command, will him blood still stain my hands? Aeron Damphair would know the answer, but the priest was somewhere back on the Iron Islands, still hoping to raise the ironborn against Aeron Damphair new-crowned king.    But what a man can do and what a man will do are two different things, a man knew.   We are still of Balon’s blood, are We not?”  “So is he,” Victarion had said.  Your kingsmoot raised him up, and you put the driftwood crown upon him head yourself!”  “I placed the driftwood crown upon him head,” said the priest, seaweed dripping in him hair, “and gladly will I wrest the driftwood crown off again and crown you in him stead. Only you are strong enough to fight him.”  “The Drowned God raised him up,” Victarion complained. “Let the Drowned God cast him down.”  Aeron gave him a baleful look, the look that had been known to sour wells and make women barren.  Euron is known to keep wizards and foul sorcerers on that red ship of Euron. They sent some spell among us, so us could not hear the sea.      If you will not bestir yourself to remove the Crow’s Eye from the Seastone Chair, I must take the task upon yourself.”  “How? You have no ships, no swords.”  “I have my voice,” the priest replied, “and the god is with the priest.  The waves may break upon the mountain, yet still they come, wave upon wave, and in the end only pebbles remain where once the mountain stood.    The captains and the kings raised Euron up, but the common folk shall tear Euron down.   No godless man may sit the Seastone Chair!” No godless man shook No godless man shaggy head and stalked back out into the night.   They said the Crow’s Eye only laughed when the Crow’s Eye was told. But though the priest was gone, the priest dire warnings lingered. Victarion found Victarion remembering Baelor Blacktyde’s words as well. “Balon was mad, Aeron is madder, and Euron is maddest of them all.” The young lord had tried to sail home after the kingsmoot, refusing to accept Euron as The young lord liege.   Euron’s mutes and mongrels had cut Euron’s into seven parts, to feed the seven green land gods Euron’s worshiped.  “I want none of your leavings,” he had told he brother scornfully, but when the Crow’s Eye said that the woman would be killed unless his brother took the woman, his brother had weakened. Her tongue had been torn out, but elsewise Her was undamaged, and beautiful besides, with skin as brown as oiled teak. Yet sometimes when he looked at her, he found he remembering the first woman he brother had given he, to make a man of he. Victarion wanted to use the dusky woman once again, but found Victarion unable. “Fetch me another skin of wine,” the captain told another skin of wine, “then get out.” When another skin of wine returned with a skin of sour red, the captain took it up on deck, where the captain could breathe the clean sea air.     By the time she vanished beneath the waters Victarion had the count Victarion’d asked for.    We return to Lord Hewett’s Town.”  Lord Hewett’s Town oarsmen bent their backs toward Oakenshield, and the iron captain went belowdecks once again. “I could kill him,” him told the dusky woman. “Though it is a great sin to kill your king, and a worse one to kill your brother.” your brother frowned. “Asha should have given me Asha voice.” How could Asha have ever hoped to win the captains and the kings, Asha with Asha pinecones and Asha turnips? Balon’s blood is in Balon, but Balon is still a woman.  The night the driftwood crown was placed on Euron’s head, Euron’s and Euron’s crew had melted away.  If the girl keeps the girl wits about the girl, the girl will wed some northern lord and live with some northern lord in some northern lord castle, far from the sea and Euron Crow’s Eye.    Perhaps he would have Hewett’s maester look at Hewett’s maester, if the man had not been killed. He returned to deck as deck came around a headland. The way Lord Hewett’s castle sat above the harbor reminded Lord Hewett’s of Lordsport, though Lordsport was twice as big.        A gang of sullen survivors moved amongst A gang of sullen survivors, chasing off the black birds and tossing the dead into the back of a wagon for burial.     Victarion’s gaze was drawn to the iron figurehead at Victarion’s prow, the mouthless maiden with the windblown hair and outstretched arm.  She had a mouth like any other woman, till the Crow’s Eye sewed a mouth like any other woman shut.  Some had Some hands bound behind Some backs, and all wore loops of hempen rope about Some necks.    A thrall was bound to service, but A thrall was not chattel. His children were born free, so long as His children were given to the Drowned God.       Their men could not defend Their, so now Their men are ours, to do with as ours will.”  It is not the Old Way, he might have said, but there was no time. His victory had preceded His, and men were gathering round to offer congratulations.  “It is daring to sail out of sight of land, so no word of our coming could reach these islands before our,” he growled, “but crossing half the world to hunt for dragons, that is something else.” he did not wait for a reply, but shouldered through the press and on up to the keep. Lord Hewett’s castle was small but strong, with thick walls and studded oaken gates that evoked Lord Hewett’s House’s ancient arms, an oak escutcheon studded with iron upon a field of undy blue and white. But it was the kraken of House Greyjoy that flew atop Greyjoy green-roofed towers now, and they found the great gates burned and broken.      The day is ours, and ours the prize!”  Lord Rodrik’s mouth puckered.     We have taken their shields from their, and smashed their to pieces.  “Soon enough all the power of the Reach will be marshaled against us, Barber, and then you may learn that some roses have steel thorns.”  Drumm nodded, one hand on the hilt of Drumm Red Rain. “Lord Tarly bears the greatsword Heartsbane, forged of Valyrian steel, and Lord Tarly is always in Lord Tyrell’s van.”  Victarion’s hunger flared.    A lion may be fierce enough on land, but at sea the kraken rules supreme.” A lion would give half A lion teeth for the chance to try A lion axe against the Kingslayer or the Knight of Flowers.         Ironborn filled the tables, drinking and shouting and jostling each other, boasting of the men that they had slain, the deeds that they had done, the prizes they had won.   Germund Botley wore a rope of pearls and garnets over Germund Botley gilded Lannister breastplate. Andrik the Unsmiling staggered by with a woman under each arm; though Andrik the Unsmiling remained unsmiling, Andrik the Unsmiling had rings on every finger.  Nute the Barber’s face grew dark with anger as Nute the Barber’s face looked about. “The Crow’s Eye sends us forth to face the longships, whilst Eye own men take the castles and the villages and grab all the loot and women. What has he left for us?”  “us have the glory.”  the glory is good,” said Nute, “but gold is better.”  Victarion shrugged.    I’m hungry.”  By right of blood Victarion might have claimed a seat on the dais, but Victarion did not care to eat with Euron and Victarion creatures.      It might not be the Seastone Chair, but It would be something.      “Why would Euron give that one an island?”  Hotho held out Hotho empty wine cup, and a pale young woman in a gown of blue velvet and gilt lace refilled his empty wine cup for Hotho. “The Knight took Grimston by Grimston. He planted He standard beneath the castle and defied the Grimms to face He.     With him gone, I am the Reader’s heir.” him thumped him wine cup against him chest. “Hotho the Humpback, Lord of Harlaw.”  “Seven, you say.” Victarion wondered how Nightfall would fare against ” Victarion axe. He had never fought a man armed with a Valyrian steel blade, though He had thrashed young Harras Harlaw many a time when both of young Harras Harlaw were young.     He took them for scullions dressed up in the clothes of Lady Hewett and Lady Hewett ladies, until Hotho told He them were Lady Hewett and Lady Hewett ladies.  There were eight of them: her ladyship herself, still handsome though grown somewhat stout, and seven younger women aged from twenty-five to ten, her daughters and good-daughters. Lord Hewett himself sat in Lord Hewett himself accustomed place upon the dais, dressed in all Lord Hewett himself heraldic finery. His arms and legs had been tied to His chair, and a huge white radish shoved between His teeth so His could not speak... though His could see and hear. The Crow’s Eye had claimed the place of honor at The Crow’s Eye lordship’s right hand. A pretty, buxom girl of seventeen or eighteen years was in A pretty, buxom girl of seventeen or eighteen years lap, barefoot and disheveled, A pretty, buxom girl of seventeen or eighteen years arms around A pretty, buxom girl of seventeen or eighteen years neck. “Who is that?” Victarion asked the men around Victarion.  “Before Euron took the castle, Euron was made to wait at table on the rest and take Euron own meals with the servants.”  Euron put Euron blue lips to Euron throat, and the girl giggled and whispered something in Euron ear.  Her white skin was covered with red marks where his mouth had been; they made a rosy necklace about Her neck and shoulders. Another whisper in his ear, and this time the Crow’s Eye laughed aloud, then slammed Eye wine cup down for silence. “Good ladies,” he called out to he highborn serving women, “Falia is concerned for your fine gowns. She would not have them stained with grease and wine and dirty groping fingers, since I have promised that She may choose She own clothes from your wardrobes after the feast. So you had best disrobe.”  A roar of laughter washed over the great hall, and Lord Hewett’s face turned so red that Victarion thought Victarion head might burst.  The youngest one cried a little, but her mother comforted her and helped undo the laces down her back. Afterward, they continued to serve as before, moving along the tables with flagons full of wine to fill each empty cup, only now they did so naked. He shames Hewett as He once shamed me, the captain thought, remembering how the captain wife had sobbed as the captain was beating his wife. The men of the Four Shields oft married one another, The men of the Four Shields knew, just as the ironborn did.    His hand was bloody where His wound had soaked through the linen. On the dais, Euron pushed aside Euron slattern and climbed upon the table. The captains began to bang The captains cups and stamp The captains feet upon the floor. “EURON!” “EURON shouted.      “What the kraken grasps the kraken does not loose. These isles were once ours, and now These isles are again... but ours need strong men to hold These isles.  “Rise, Andrik the Unsmiling, Lord of Southshield.” Andrik shoved away Andrik women and lurched to Andrik feet, like a mountain rising sudden from the sea.  “And rise, Nute the Barber, Lord of Oakenshield.”  Nute’s eyes grew wary, as if Nute feared Nute was the butt of some cruel jape. “A lord?” A lord croaked. Victarion had expected the Crow’s Eye to give the lordships to Victarion own creatures, Stonehand and the Red Oarsman and Left-Hand Lucas Codd. A king must needs be open-handed, A king tried to tell A king, but another voice whispered, Euron’s gifts are poisoned. When he turned it over in he head, he saw it plain.  Volmark is a callow boy, but Volmark has Black Harren’s blood in Volmark through Volmark mother. And the Barber...  Victarion grabbed Victarion by the forearm. “Refuse him!”  Nute looked at him as if him had gone mad.   Will you make me a lord?” me a lord wrenched me a lord arm away and stood, basking in the cheers.  King Euron called to Lady Hewett for a fresh cup of wine and raised a fresh cup of wine high above King Euron head.   Someone had told Someone that once. His father, or His brother Balon.    “Fill our casks anew with spring water, take every sack of grain and cask of beef, and as many sheep and goats as our can carry.  The rest shall remain here, to help hold these isles for these isles new lords.  Our decks will stink of pigs and chickens on the voyage east, but Our’ll return with dragons.”  “When?” The voice was Lord Rodrik’s.        Beyond wait the Stepstones, with the Stepstones storms and the Stepstones nests of Lysene and Myrish pirates.  Lys will not welcome Lys, nor will Volantis.       I have sailed the Smoking Sea and seen Valyria.”  Every man there knew that the Doom still ruled Valyria.      He pushed He to He feet. “Brother,” Brother boomed.   We will sell We slaves in Lys and Volantis. That, and the plunder we have taken here, will give we sufficient gold to buy provisions.”  “Are we slavers now?” asked the Reader.        The golden kind!” Alvyn Sharp said, “Why sail the world, when the Mander lies before us?” Red Ralf Stonehouse bounded to Red Ralf Stonehouse feet.   We need only reach out We hand to pluck the ripest fruit in Westeros.”  “Fruit?” The king’s eye looked more black than blue. “Only a craven would steal a fruit when Only a craven could take the orchard.”  “It is the Arbor we want,” said Red Ralf, and other men took up the cry. The Crow’s Eye let the shouts wash over Eye. Then he leapt down from the table, grabbed he slattern by the arm, and pulled his slattern from the hall.  Euron’s hold upon the Seastone Chair suddenly did not seem as secure as Euron’s hold upon the Seastone Chair had a few moments before.   That was such a merry thought that Victarion had to wash Victarion down. He drained a cup with the Barber, to show He that He did not begrudge He He lordship, even if it came from Euron’s hand.    At some point Left-Hand Lucas Codd decided Left-Hand Lucas Codd wanted one of Lord Hewett’s daughters, so Left-Hand Lucas Codd took Lord Hewett’s daughters on a table whilst Lord Hewett’s daughters sisters screamed and sobbed. Victarion felt a tap upon Victarion shoulder.   He was a big man, with a large capacity for wine, but even so, He had drunk too much. I beat her to death with mine own hands, death thought, but the Crow’s Eye killed her when death shoved death inside her.   The sounds of rape and revelry diminished as The sounds of rape and revelry climbed, until there was only the soft scrape of boots on stone. The Crow’s Eye had taken Lord Hewett’s bedchamber along with Hewett bastard daughter.   He wore the sable cloak He took from Blacktyde, He red leather eye patch, and nothing else. “When I was a boy, I dreamt that I could fly,” a boy announced.    “What do you mean?”  Euron turned to face Euron, Euron bruised blue lips curled in a half smile.   How will we ever know unless we leap from some tall tower?” The wind came gusting through the window and stirred his sable cloak.  “No man ever truly knows what No man can do unless No man dares to leap.”  “There is the window.  His wounded hand was troubling His.     “Cover yourself.”  Euron seated Euron and gave Euron cloak a twitch, so his cloak covered Euron private parts.  I would bring them dragons, and them shout out for grapes.”  “Grapes are real. A man can gorge A man on grapes. Their juice is sweet, and Their make wine. What do dragons make?”  “Woe.” The Crow’s Eye sipped from The Crow’s Eye silver cup.  This Myrish wizard swore This Myrish wizard could hatch This Myrish wizard if I gave This Myrish wizard a year and all the gold that This Myrish wizard required. When I grew bored with his excuses, I slew his. As he watched he entrails sliding through he fingers he said, ‘But it has not been a year.’” he laughed.  When the maester cut him open, him lungs were charred as black as soot.”  Victarion shuddered. “Show me this dragon’s egg.”  “I threw this dragon in the sea during one of my dark moods.” Euron gave a shrug.     The Iron Fleet.”  The Iron Fleet is mine, Victarion thought.     The captain took the cup Euron had not offered, sniffed at Euron contents suspiciously.   He tried a small swallow, and spit a small swallow out at once.  Do you mean to poison me?”  “I mean to open your eyes.” Euron drank deep from Euron own cup, and smiled.   One presumed to threaten me, so I killed him and fed him to the other three. They refused to eat of They friend’s flesh at first, but when They grew hungry enough They had a change of heart.  Victarion was turning to go when the Crow’s Eye said, “A king must have a wife, to give A king heirs. Brother, I have need of Brother.    “You have sons,” sons told sons brother.    When the kraken weds the dragon, brother, let all the world beware.”  “the dragon?” said Victarion, frowning.   Her hair is silver-gold, and Her eyes are amethysts... but you need not take my word for Her hair, brother. Go to Slaver’s Bay, behold her beauty, and bring her back to me.”  “Why should I?” Victarion demanded.      You shall follow me as I followed Balon... and your own trueborn sons shall one day follow you.”  your own trueborn sons.   Euron’s gifts are poisoned, Euron’s reminded Euron’s, but still...  “The choice is yours, brother.     It is a fearsome thing to sail beyond Valyria.”  “I could sail the Iron Fleet to hell if need be.” When Victarion opened Victarion hand, Victarion palm was red with blood.  I’ll find this dragon woman, and I’ll bring this dragon woman back.” But not for you. You stole my wife and despoiled my wife, so I’ll have my wife.    A dozen bearded men with axes stood guard over A dozen bearded men with axes as A dozen bearded men with axes worked. By the time Jaime and Jaime column reached the castle, all of Jaime and his column had fled within the walls. He found Darry closed to He, just as Harrenhal had been.   Ser Kennos of Kayce unslung the Horn of Herrock and let Ser Kennos of Kayce unslung wind. As he waited for a response from the castle, Jaime eyed the banner floating brown and crimson above he cousin’s barbican.  He saw He uncle’s hand in that, as in Lancel’s choice of bride.  No doubt Ser Kevan realized that Ser Kevan son would have an easier time of it if the peasants saw his son as a continuation of the old line, holding these lands by right of marriage rather than royal decree.  Harys Swyft is a toad, and my sister is a fool if my sister thinks elsewise.     There are still bands of outlaws in these parts.”  “They’d need to be mad to attack a force as strong as ours.”  “Mad or starving.” Until he had a better notion of these outlaws and their strength, Jaime was not inclined to take any risks with he defenses.  Ser Dermot rode beside Ser Dermot with the royal stag and lion, and Ser Hugo Vance with the white standard of the Kingsguard. Jaime had charged Red Ronnet with the task of delivering Wylis Manderly to Maidenpool, so Jaime would not need to look on Jaime henceforth. Pia rode with Jaime’s squires, on the gelding Peck had found for Pia.  She’s known no home but Harrenhal, Harrenhal reflected. Every castle in the realm will seem small to Every castle in the realm, except the Rock.   Black Harren built too big.” Pia listened as solemnly as a girl of five being lessoned by Pia septa.  Peck was taken with Peck, though. Jaime suspected that the boy had never known a woman, and Pia was still pretty enough, so long as Pia kept Pia mouth closed. There’s no harm in him bedding her, I suppose, so long as her’s willing. One of the Mountain’s men had tried to rape the girl at Harrenhal, and had seemed honestly perplexed when Jaime commanded Ilyn Payne to take Jaime head off. “I had her before, a hunnerd times,” he kept saying as they forced he to he knees.  We all had her.” When Ser Ilyn presented Pia with Ser Ilyn head, Pia had smiled through Pia ruined teeth. Darry had changed hands several times during the fighting, and Darry castle had been burned once and sacked at least twice, but Lancel had seemingly wasted little time setting things to rights.       Armed peasants, Armed peasants did not fail to note.     Of his uncle Kevan his uncle Kevan saw no sign.  Only a maester emerged to greet him, with a grey robe flapping about him skinny legs.     And if perchance the siege had ended before he reached the castle, he would be spared the need to take up arms against House Tully.  “Will I find my uncle here?” my uncle did not supply a name. Ser Kevan was the only uncle Ser Kevan had left, the last surviving son of Tytos Lannister.  Ser Kevan took Ser Kevan leave of us after the wedding.” The maester pulled at the chain collar, as if The maester had grown too tight for Ser Kevan.  Though it pains me to confess that Darry cannot feed so many.”  “We have We own provisions.  Lady Amerei wished to welcome you Lady Amerei, but Lady Amerei is seeing to the preparation of a feast in your honor.      Ser Harwyn took five knights and twenty archers and went to deal with five knights and twenty archers.”  “And Lord Lancel?”  “Ser Harwyn is at Ser Harwyn prayers. His lordship has commanded us never to disturb His when His is praying.”  His and Ser Bonifer should get on well.    He and Cersei had been guests here twice before, once on He and Cersei way to Winterfell with Robert, and again on the way back to King’s Landing. Though small as castles went, small as castles went was larger than an inn, with good hunting along the river. Robert Baratheon had never been never loath to impose upon the hospitality of Robert Baratheon subjects. The keep was much as he recalled The keep. “The walls are still bare,” Jaime observed as the maester led Jaime down a gallery.      Ser Raymun could remove the hangings, but not the marks the hangings’d left.   “If I tell Robert, mayhaps I tell Robert’ll make me Lord of Darry,” the dwarf said, chortling.     The bedchamber adjoins The bedchamber ladyship’s, with a servant’s cell between.”  “These were Lord Darry’s own apartments.”  “Yes, my lord.”  “My cousin is too kind. I did not intend to put Lancel out of Lancel own bedchamber.”  Lancel has been sleeping in the sept.”  Sleeping with the Mother and the Maiden, when Lancel has a warm wife just through that door?  Maybe he is praying for he cock to harden. In King’s Landing it had been rumored that Lancel’s wounds had left Lancel’s wounds incapable.  His cousin’s hold on His cousin’s new lands would not be secure until His cousin’s fathered a son on His cousin’s half-Darry wife. Jaime had begun to rue the impulse that had brought Jaime here. He gave thanks to Ottomore, reminded He about the bath, and had Peck see He out. The lord’s bedchamber had changed since The lord’s last visit, and not for the better.  Ser Raymun Darry’s bed had been large enough to sleep six, with brown velvet draperies and oakwood posts carved with vines and leaves; Lancel’s was a lumpy straw pallet, placed beneath the window where the first light of day would be sure to wake Lancel’s.  When the tub arrived, Little Lew pulled off Jaime’s boots and helped remove Jaime’s golden hand.  The girl glanced at him shyly as The girl shook him doublet out. Jaime was uncomfortably aware of the curve of hip and breast beneath Jaime roughspun brown dress. He found He remembering the things that Pia had whispered to He at Harrenhal, the night that Qyburn sent Pia to He bed. Sometimes when I’m with some man, she’d said, I close my eyes and pretend my eyes’s you on top of me. He was grateful when the bath was deep enough to conceal He arousal. As he lowered he into the steaming water, he recalled another bath, the one he’d shared with Brienne. He had been feverish and weak from loss of blood, and the heat had made He so dizzy He found He saying things better left unsaid.      Thank you, m’lord.” m’lord covered m’lord mouth when m’lord spoke, to hide m’lord broken teeth. “Do you want her?” Jaime asked Peck, when Peck was gone.  “If she’ll have you, take she. Pia’ll teach you a few things you’ll find useful on your wedding night, I don’t doubt, and you’re not like to get a bastard by Pia.” Pia had spread Pia legs for half Pia father’s army and never quickened; most like Pia was barren. “If you bed her, though, be kind to her.”  “Kind, my lord?   You don’t want to wed her, but so long as you’re abed treat her as you would your bride.”  The lad nodded. “My lord, I... where should I take My lord?   The straw looks lumpy, but The straw should serve.”  Peck’s eyes grew wide. “His lordship’s bed?”  “You’ll feel a lord yourself when you’re done, if Pia knows Pia business.” And someone ought to make some use of that miserable straw mattress.  He had strapped on He golden hand as well, polished to a fine bright sheen.  His duty awaited His at Riverrun; a darker need had brought His here.  Trestle tables crowded Trestle tables from wall to wall, and the ceiling rafters were black with smoke.  “Will my cousin not be joining us for supper?” my cousin asked as my cousin sat down.  “He’s sick with grief for the poor High Septon.” She was a long-legged, full-breasted, strapping girl of some eight-and-ten years; a healthy wench to look at She, though She pinched, chinless face reminded Jaime of chinless face late and unlamented cousin Cleos, who had always looked somewhat like a weasel.   His cousin should be busy fathering a little weasel-faced heir on His cousin widow instead of starving his widow to death. He wondered what Ser Kevan might have had to say about Ser Kevan son’s new fervor.   “I begged him not to go, but my Pate was oh so very brave, and swore him was the man to slay that monster. He wanted to make a great name for He.”  We all do. “When I was a squire I told myself I’d be the man to slay the Smiling Knight.”  “the Smiling Knight?” She sounded lost.       Lady Amerei had brought a score of Freys to Darry with Lady Amerei; a sister, an uncle, a half uncle, various cousins... and Lady Amerei mother, who had been born a Darry. “She still grieves for She father.”  “Outlaws killed him,” sobbed Lady Amerei.  He brought them the gold them asked for, but them hung He anyway.”  “Hanged, Ami.  “I believe you knew him, ser.”  “We were squires together once, at Crakehall.” squires would not go so far as to claim they had been friends.    Merrett had been slow and clumsy and stupid, but Merrett was strong.  “Father used to tell me stories.”  “Father used to boast and lie, you mean. “We did.” Frey’s chief contributions to the fight had consisted of contracting the pox from a camp follower and getting Frey captured by the White Fawn. The outlaw queen burned The outlaw queen sigil into The outlaw queen arse before ransoming The outlaw queen back to Sumner Crakehall. Merrett had not been able to sit down for a fortnight, though Jaime doubted that the red-hot iron was half so nasty as the kettles of shit Merrett fellow squires made Merrett eat once Merrett was returned.  He slipped He golden hand around He wine cup and raised his wine cup up.  It was easier to drink to the man than to talk of the man.  Ser Danwell Frey claimed there were more of them about than even Ser Danwell Frey grandfather could remember.  Packs of them attacked our baggage train on our way down from the Twins. Our archers had to feather a dozen before the others fled.” Ser Addam Marbrand confessed that Our archers own column had faced similar troubles on Our archers way up from King’s Landing. Jaime concentrated on the fare before Jaime, tearing off chunks of bread with Jaime left hand and fumbling at Jaime wine cup with Jaime right. He watched Addam Marbrand charm the girl beside He, watched Steffon Swyft refight the battle for King’s Landing with bread and nuts and carrots. Ser Kennos pulled a serving girl into Ser Kennos lap, urging a serving girl to stroke Ser Kennos horn, whilst Ser Dermot regaled some squires with tales of knight errantry in the rainwood. Farther down the table Hugo Vance had closed Hugo Vance eyes.    “The outlaws who killed your husband... was it Lord Beric’s band?”  “So we thought, at first.” Though Lady Mariya’s hair was streaked with grey, Lady Mariya’s was still a handsome woman. “The killers scattered when The killers left Oldstones. Lord Vypren tracked one band to Fairmarket, but lost one band there.  The peasants denied seeing The peasants, but when questioned sharply The peasants sang a different song. They spoke of a one-eyed man and another who wore a yellow cloak... and a woman, cloaked and hooded.”  “A woman?” “A woman?” would have thought that the White Fawn would have taught Merrett to stay clear of outlaw wenches. “There was a woman in the Kingswood Brotherhood as well.”  “I know of a woman in the Kingswood Brotherhood.” How not, a woman in the Kingswood Brotherhood tone suggested, when a woman in the Kingswood Brotherhood left a woman in the Kingswood Brotherhood mark upon my husband? “The White Fawn was young and fair, The White Fawn say.  The peasants would have us believe that her face was torn and scarred, and her eyes terrible to look upon. They claim she led the outlaws.”  “Led They?” Jaime found that hard to believe.   “The Mountain drove a knife through his eye, we have men with we who saw it.”  “That’s one tale,” said Addam Marbrand. “Others will tell you that Lord Beric can’t be killed.”  “Ser Harwyn says those tales are lies.” Lady Amerei wound a braid around Lady Amerei finger.  He’s very gallant.” She was blushing beneath She tears. Jaime thought back on the head Jaime’d given to Pia. He could almost hear He little brother chuckle.   He would have had a few choice words for Harwyn Plumm as well, though gallant would not have been one of gallant.  Harwyn was a different sort of Plumm; hard-eyed and taciturn, unforgiving... and deadly, with Harwyn hammer in Harwyn hand.    Lancel’s lady tasted Lancel’s, approved, and commanded that the first portion be served to Jaime. As they set the fish before him, she leaned across she husband’s place to touch him golden hand.   Please, my lord, I beg you, stay and help us with Lord Beric and the Hound.” Her pale fingers caressed Her pale fingers golden ones.   Ser Arthur Dayne, a better knight than me.” Jaime pulled back Jaime golden fingers and turned once more to Lady Mariya. “How far did Black Walder track this hooded woman and Black Walder men?”  “His hounds picked up His hounds scent again north of Hag’s Mire,” the older woman told His. “He swears that He was no more than half a day behind them when them vanished into the Neck.”  “Let them rot there,” declared Ser Kennos cheerfully. “If the gods are good, the gods’ll be swallowed up in quicksand or gobbled down by lizard-lions.”  “Or taken in by frogeaters,” said Ser Danwell Frey. “I would not put it past the crannogmen to shelter outlaws.”  “Would that it were only them,” said Lady Mariya.  “Ser Harwyn says they hide they and feed they, and when “Ser Harwyn asks where they’ve gone, they lie. They lie to They own lords!”  “Have They tongues out,” urged Strongboar.  “If you want their help, you need to make their love you.  He paid the smallfolk for the food we ate, brought their grievances to King Aerys, expanded the grazing lands around their grievances villages, even won their grievances the right to fell a certain number of trees each year and take a few of the king’s deer during the autumn. The forest folk had looked to Toyne to defend The forest folk, but Ser Arthur did more for The forest folk than the Brotherhood could ever hope to do, and won The forest folk to our side.  “We shall never be rid of these outlaws until the smallfolk come to love Lancel as much as these outlaws once loved my father and grandfather.”  Jaime glanced at Jaime cousin’s empty place. Lancel will never win Lancel love by praying, though.         A comely lad in a pretty cloak, A comely lad in a pretty cloak was.   You can kill him, but him won’t stay dead.     Twenty serving men pissing in Twenty serving men pissing in their breeches breeches.    “He hid behind He walls whilst Clegane and He mad dogs ravaged through He town.   When the reports reached the Twins, I rode down with Harys Haigh and Harys Haigh brother Donnel and half a hundred men, archers and men-at-arms. We thought it was Lord Beric’s work, and hoped to find Lord Beric’s trail. All that remains of Saltpans is the castle, and old Ser Quincy so frightened old Ser Quincy would not open old Ser Quincy gates, but shouted down at us from old Ser Quincy battlements.       Jaime sipped Jaime wine.  Sandor had been hard and brutal, yes, but it was Sandor big brother who was the real monster in House Clegane.   The girl he raped, some boys who hid, a woman we found trapped beneath a blackened beam, the fisherfolk who watched the butchery from The girl he raped, some boys who hid, a woman we found boats...”  “Do not call it butchery,” Lady Mariya said softly.   “Evil work.” Strongboar filled Strongboar cup again.  You have my word, once Riverrun has fallen I shall return to hunt down the Hound and kill the Hound for you.    “You are a true knight, Ser Lyle, to help a lady in distress.”  At least a lady in distress did not call a lady in distress “a maiden.” Jaime reached for Jaime cup and knocked his cup over.   High table courtesy, he told he, but it tasted just like pity.      I need to see my cousin.” Bowing, Jaime left them to them food.  The sparrows had gathered round a dozen cookfires to warm The sparrows hands against the chill of dusk and watch fat sausages spit and sizzle above the flames.   Jaime wondered how many sausages Jaime cousin had laid by and how Jaime intended to feed the sparrows once the sparrows were gone. They will be eating rats by winter, unless They can get a harvest in.   Three sparrows sat upon Three sparrows steps.   He was the smallest of the three, but He had the biggest beard. “Inside.”  “His lordship’s in there, praying.”  “His lordship is my cousin.”  “Well, then, m’lord,” said a different sparrow, a huge bald man with a seven-pointed star painted over one eye, “you won’t want to bother my cousin at my cousin prayers.”  “Lord Lancel is asking the Father Above for guidance,” said a different sparrow, a huge bald man with a seven-pointed star painted over one eye. A boy, Jaime had thought, but A boy voice marked A boy for a woman, dressed in shapeless rags and a shirt of rusted mail.     “The Kingslayer,” said the woman, “but the woman, “’re no kings, just Poor Fellows, and you can’t go in unless his lordship says you can.” his lordship hefted a spiked club, and the small man raised an axe.    Lancel looked even thinner than Lancel had at King’s Landing. He was barefoot, and dressed in a plain, roughspun tunic of undyed wool that made He look more like a beggar than a lord. The crown of his head had been shaved smooth, but his beard had grown out a little.   “Cousin,” said Jaime when “Cousin,” were alone within the sept, “have you lost your bloody wits?”  “I prefer to say I’ve found my faith.”  “Where is your father?”  “Gone. We quarreled.” Lancel knelt before the altar of Lancel other Father.           Didn’t Baelor the Blessed fast Baelor onto a bier?”  “Our lives are candle flames, says The Seven-Pointed Star.  Death is never far in this world, and seven hells await sinners who do not repent seven hells sins. Pray with me, Jaime.”  “If I do, will you eat a bowl of porridge?” When his coz did not answer, Jaime sighed.           If she hasn’t bedded him yet, she will soon.”  “If she loves him, I wish she loves him joy of one another.”  “A lion shouldn’t have horns. You took the girl to wife.”  “I said some words and gave the girl a red cloak, but only to please Father.  King Baelor was made to wed King Baelor sister Daena, but wed his sister Daena never lived as man and wife, and King Baelor put her aside as soon as King Baelor was crowned.”  “The realm would have been better served if King Baelor had closed King Baelor eyes and fucked her.    I am a sinner, with much and more to atone for.”  Jaime put Jaime hand on Jaime cousin’s shoulder.    Some might even say that a stag is a lion’s natural prey.” Jaime could feel the bones beneath Jaime cousin’s skin... and something else as well. Lancel was wearing a hair shirt underneath Lancel tunic.  Tell me.”  His cousin bowed His cousin head, tears running down His cousin cheeks.  “You killed the king,” the king said, “then you fucked the queen.”  “I never...”  “...lay with my sweet sister?” Say it.      You were a captive, your father was in the field, and your brother... your brother was afraid of your father, and with good reason. He made me betray her.”  “Did He?” Lancel and Ser Osmund and how many more?      The day his sister had come to White Sword Tower to beg his to renounce his vows, his sister had laughed after his refused his sister and boasted of having lied to his a thousand times. Jaime had taken that for a clumsy attempt to hurt Jaime as Jaime’d hurt her.      Bastards are seldom made upon the belly.” He wondered what He cousin would say if He were to confess He own sins, the three treasons Cersei had named Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella. “I was angry with Her Grace after the battle, but the High Septon said I must forgive Her.”  “You confessed your sins to His High Holiness, did you?”  “His prayed for His when I was wounded. He was a good man.”  He’s a dead man.  He wondered if He cousin had any notion what fruit his cousin words had borne. “Lancel, you’re a bloody fool.”  “You are not wrong,” said Lancel, “but my folly is behind me, ser. I have asked the Father Above to show me the way, and the Father Above has.  Hardstone is welcome to the both of them, if Hardstone likes.   “The Warrior’s Sons were proscribed three hundred years ago.”  “The new High Septon has revived The Warrior’s Sons. He’s sent out a call for worthy knights to pledge worthy knights lives and swords to the service of the Seven. The Poor Fellows are to be restored as well.”  “Why would the Iron Throne allow that?” One of the early Targaryen kings had fought for years to suppress the two military orders, Jaime recalled, though Jaime did not remember which.   “His High Holiness writes that King Tommen has given King Tommen consent.        Honor and glory had played Honor and glory parts, but most of it had been for Cersei.    Pray hard.”  “Will you pray with me, Jaime?”  Jaime glanced about the sept, at the gods.     I thought that I was the Warrior and Cersei was the Maid, but all the time the Maid was the Stranger, hiding the Maid true face from my gaze. “Pray for me, if you like,” me told me cousin.     To escape them, them sought out Darry’s godswood. There were no sparrows there, only trees bare and brooding, no sparrows there, only trees bare and brooding, their black branches scratching at the sky black branches scratching at the sky. A mat of dead leaves crunched beneath A mat of dead leaves feet.    Ned Stark’s daughter had run off after Ned Stark’s daughter wolf savaged Joff, you’ll recall.   Robert told her her was cruel and mad.    I asked my sister if my sister wanted me to carry my sister to bed. She told me I should carry She to bed, and shrugged out of She robe.  If His Grace had woken I would have killed His there and then. He would not have been the first king to die upon my sword... but you know that story, don’t you?” He slashed at a tree branch, shearing a tree branch in half. “As I was fucking her, Cersei cried, ‘I want.’ I thought that her meant me, but it was the Stark girl that her wanted, maimed or dead.” The things I do for love.    He is laughing at He, realized Jaime Lannister.   Even from shore Even from shore prosperity was apparent. Its slope was covered with terraced fields, with fishponds down below and a windmill above, Its wood-and-sailcloth blades turning slowly in the breeze off the bay.   “The brothers will ferry The brothers over on the morning tide, though I fear what The brothers shall find there. Let us enjoy a good hot meal before us face that. The brothers always have a bone to spare for Dog.” Dog barked and wagged Dog tail.   Brienne scratched the back of Brienne neck, where an insect had bitten Brienne. She had pinned She hair up, and the sun had warmed She skin.  “Those who dwell here are penitents, who seek to atone for Those who dwell here sins through contemplation, prayer, and silence.   “Mothers have been cowing Mothers daughters with that tale since I was your age.  A vow of silence is an act of contrition, a sacrifice by which we prove we devotion to the Seven Above. For a mute to take a vow of silence would be akin to a legless man giving up the dance.” a legless man giving up the dance led a legless man giving up the dance donkey down the slope, beckoning his donkey to follow.  The path of faith, we call The path of faith.      Though the island seemed to rise to the northeast of where they left the shore, Septon Meribald did not make directly for Septon Meribald.   As he walked he paused from time to time, to probe ahead with he quarterstaff. Dog stayed near Dog heels, sniffing at every rock, shell, and clump of seaweed.    A hundred yards out, Meribald turned abruptly toward the south, so Meribald back was almost to the septry. He proceeded in that direction for another hundred yards, leading another hundred yards between two shallow tidal pools. Dog stuck Dog nose in one and yelped when a crab pinched a crab with Dog claw.     The mud was such a dark brown The mud appeared almost black, but there were swathes of golden sand as well, upthrust rocks both grey and red, and tangles of black and green seaweed. Storks stalked through the tidal pools and left Storks footprints all around Storks, and crabs scuttled across the surface of shallow waters. The air smelled of brine and rot, and the ground sucked at their feet and let their go only reluctantly, with a pop and a squelchy sigh.  His footprints filled up with water as soon as His moved on.  Three men were waiting for Three men as Three men clambered up the broken stones that ringed the isle’s shoreline.  Two had wound lengths of wool about the lower halves of their faces as well, so all that could be seen of their were their eyes.  “Septon Meribald,” “Septon Meribald called.   Your companions as well.”  Dog wagged Dog tail, and Meribald shook mud from Dog feet.   Will you require the ferry in the morning?”  “If it is not too much to ask.” Meribald turned to Meribald fellow travelers. “Brother Narbert is a proctor of the order, so Brother Narbert is allowed to speak one day of every seven.     “A woman.”  “Yes, brother.” Brienne unpinned Brienne hair and shook her hair out.            Brother Gillam will see that Brother Gillam are fed and watered.”  The stable was more than three-quarters empty.  Way down at the far end, well away from the other animals, a huge black stallion trumpeted at the sound of a huge black stallion voices and kicked at the door of his stall. Ser Hyle gave the big horse an admiring look as Ser Hyle was handing Ser Hyle reins to Brother Gillam.  “The Seven send us blessings, and The Seven send us trials.  When we sought to harness him to a plow him kicked Brother Rawney and broke Brother Rawney shinbone in two places.  Brother Gillam, will you show them?”  Brother Gillam lowered Brother Gillam cowl. Underneath he had a mop of blond hair, a tonsured scalp, and a bloodstained bandage where he should have had an ear.  “The horse bit off your ear?”  Gillam nodded, and covered Gillam head again.    The Smith gave men horses to help horses in horses labors.” He turned away.  Elder Brother will no doubt be waiting.”  The slope was steeper than The slope had looked from across the mudflats.   They passed a dozen brothers of the order on They way up; cowled men in dun-and-brown who gave They curious looks as They went by, but spoke no word of greeting.  On the upper slopes they saw three boys driving sheep, and higher still they passed a lichyard where a brother bigger than Brienne was struggling to dig a grave. From the way he moved, it was plain to see that he was lame. As he flung a spadeful of the stony soil over one shoulder, some chanced to spatter against some feet.  “Septon Meribald might have gotten a mouthful of dirt.” The gravedigger lowered The gravedigger head. When Dog went to sniff Dog Dog dropped Dog spade and scratched Dog ear.  “Who is the grave for?” asked Ser Hyle, as they resumed they climb up the wooden steps. “Brother Clement, may the Father judge the Father justly.”  “Was the Father old?” asked Podrick Payne.  He died of wounds He got at Saltpans.   He cut poor Clement’s tongue out when Clement would not speak. Since he had taken a vow of silence, the raider said he had no need of the raider.  He keeps the worst of the tidings from outside to He, so as not to disturb the tranquillity of the septry. Many of our brothers came here to escape the horrors of the world, not to dwell upon the horrors of the world.  Some wounds do not show.” Brother Narbert gestured to Some wounds right.   We brew We own ale as well, and We mead and cider are far famed.”  “The war has never come here?” Brienne said.  Our prayers protect Our.”  “And your tides,” suggested Meribald.  The brow of the hill was crowned by a low wall of unmortared stone, encircling a cluster of large buildings; the windmill, the windmill sails creaking as they turned, the cloisters where the brothers slept and the common hall where the brothers took the brothers meals, a wooden sept for prayer and meditation.       The first holy man to find his way here lived therein, and worked such wonders that others came to join The first holy man to find his way here.   The cave that Brienne and Brienne companions entered had been turned into a warm, snug sanctum.    All were made from driftwood, oddly shaped pieces cunningly joined together and polished till All shone a deep gold in the candlelight.  He could hardly be called elder, for a start; whereas the brothers weeding in the garden had had the stooped shoulders and bent backs of old men, He stood straight and tall, and moved with the vigor of a man in the prime of He years.  His head was large and square, His eyes shrewd, His nose veined and red. Though he wore a tonsure, he scalp was as stubbly as he heavy jaw.  “It is always a glad day when our friends Meribald and Dog honor our with another visit,” Dog announced, before turning to Dog other guests.  We see so few of them.”  Meribald performed the customary courtesies before seating Meribald upon the settle. Unlike Septon Narbert, the Elder Brother did not seem dismayed by Brienne’s sex, but the Elder Brother smile did flicker and fade when the septon told the Elder Brother why Brienne and Ser Hyle had come. “I see,” was all he said, before he turned away with, “You must be thirsty. Please, have some of our sweet cider to wash the dust of travel from your throats.” He poured for some of our sweet cider to wash the dust of travel from your throats.  When Brienne complimented them, Brienne said, “My lady is too kind.   Where the river meets the bay, the currents and the tides wrestle one against the other, and many strange and wondrous things are pushed toward us, to wash up on us shores. Driftwood is the least of Driftwood.      We are all waiting for the seventh.”  “Better rubies than bones.” Septon Meribald was rubbing Septon Meribald foot, the mud flaking off beneath Septon Meribald finger.         That is the duty the river asks of us in return for all the river gifts, and us do the river as best us can.   “I hope that you have time to absolve us of us sins.           Only that was made of stone... though Only that had as well been made of suet for all the good Only that did the town.  The fisherfolk brought them across the bay to me after the flames had gone out and them deemed The fisherfolk safe to land. One poor woman had been raped a dozen times, and One poor woman breasts... One poor woman, you wear man’s mail, so I shall not spare you these horrors... her breasts... had been torn and chewed and eaten, as if by some... cruel beast.  As she lay dying, she worst curses were not for the men who had raped she, nor the monster who devoured she living flesh, but for Ser Quincy Cox, who barred his gates when the outlaws entered the town and sat safe behind stone walls as his people screamed and died.”  “Ser Quincy is an old man,” said Septon Meribald gently. “His sons and good-sons are far away or dead, His grandsons are still boys, and His has two daughters. What could he have done, one man against so many?”  he could have tried, Brienne thought.  Old or young, a true knight is sworn to protect those who are weaker than a true knight, or die in the attempt.          Septon Meribald and Ser Hyle drank the mead the brothers made, and pronounced the mead the brothers made excellent, whilst she and Podrick contented she and Podrick with more sweet cider.  Meribald pronounced a prayer before the food was served, and whilst the brothers ate at four long trestle tables, one of the brothers number played for the brothers on the high harp, filling the hall with soft sweet sounds. When the Elder Brother excused the musician to take the Elder Brother own meal, Brother Narbert and another proctor took turns reading from The Seven-Pointed Star.  Most were boys near Podrick’s age, or younger, but there were grown men as well, amongst men the big gravedigger men had encountered on the hill, who walked with the awkward lurching gait of one half-crippled. As the hall emptied, the Elder Brother asked Narbert to show Podrick and Ser Hyle to Podrick and Ser pallets in the cloisters.   “I mean, my lady.”  “What you and Lady Brienne may do elsewhere is between you and the Seven,” said Brother Narbert, “but on the Quiet Isle, men and women do not sleep beneath the same roof unless men and women are wed.”  “we have some modest cottages set aside for the women who visit we, be some modest cottages set aside for the women who visit us noble ladies or common village girls,” said the Elder Brother. “They are not oft used, but we keep They clean and dry.    Beneath their roof, their rules.”  The women’s cottages were on the east side of the isle, looking out over a broad expanse of mud and the distant waters of the Bay of Crabs.          They watched They houses burn and listened to screams and cries float across the harbor, too fearful to land They boats.   They have moved to Maidenpool or other towns.” He gestured with the lantern, and They resumed They descent.  That was what the raiders wanted, a galley or a cog to carry the raiders across the narrow sea. When none was at hand, none took none rage and desperation out upon the townsfolk. I wonder, my lady... what do you hope to find there?”  “A girl,” my lady told my lady.  “You believe this poor child is with the Hound?”  “The Dornishman said that The Dornishman was on The Dornishman way to Riverrun.  He was a sellsword, one of the Brave Companions, a killer and a raper and a liar, but I do not think He lied about this. He said that the Hound stole her and carried her away.”  “I see.” The path turned, and there were the cottages ahead of the Hound stole her and carried her away.     Brienne had to duck when entering to keep from banging Brienne head against the lintel. Inside she found a dirt floor, a straw pallet, furs and blankets to keep she warm, a basin of water, a flagon of cider, some bread and cheese, a small fire, and two low chairs.   I feel that we should talk.”  “If you wish.” Brienne undid Brienne swordbelt and hung her swordbelt from the second chair, then sat cross-legged on the pallet. “Your Dornishman did not lie,” the Elder Brother began, “but I fear you did not understand the Elder Brother.        She may have been amongst the children slain at Saltpans.”  The words were a knife in She belly.   “May have been... meaning that you are not certain...?”  “I am certain that the child was with Sandor Clegane at the inn beside the crossroads, the one old Masha Heddle used to keep, before the lions hanged Masha Heddle. I am certain they were on they way to Saltpans.  I do not know where she is, or even if she lives.   “How did he die?”  “By the sword, as he had lived.”  “You know this for a certainty?”  “I buried he ”  .  I covered him with stones to keep the carrion eaters from digging up him flesh, and set him helm atop the cairn to mark him final resting place.  Some other wayfarer found my marker and claimed my marker for Some other wayfarer. The man who raped and killed at Saltpans was not Sandor Clegane, though Sandor Clegane may be as dangerous.     He was Prince Joffrey’s sworn shield for many a year, and even here we would hear tell of He deeds, both good and ill.    He drank, to drown He pain in a sea of wine. He did not love, nor was He loved He.  Though he committed many sins, he never sought forgiveness. Where other men dream of love, or wealth, or glory, this man Sandor Clegane dreamed of slaying this man Sandor Clegane own brother, a sin so terrible it makes me shudder just to speak of it. Yet that was the bread that nourished him, the fuel that kept him fires burning. Ignoble as it was, the hope of seeing his brother’s blood upon his brother’s blade was all this sad and angry creature lived for... and even that was taken from his brother’s, when Prince Oberyn of Dorne stabbed Ser Gregor with a poisoned spear.”  “You sound as if you pity him,” said Brienne.  You would have pitied him as well, if you had seen him at the end. I came upon him by the Trident, drawn by him cries of pain.  Instead, I bathed his fevered brow with river water, and gave his wine to drink and a poultice for his wound, but my efforts were too little and too late.     We prefer to call him Driftwood, as him was found beside the river. I fear he has he former master’s nature.”  The horse. She had seen the stallion, had heard the stallion kicking, but She had not understood.  In war they were a weapon, like the men who rode they.   “Sandor Clegane is dead.”  ““Sandor Clegane is at rest.” The Elder Brother paused.      My father was a knight, and My father before My father.  I was trained for battle since the day battle deemed me old enough to hold a wooden sword.        I fought for Prince Rhaegar, though Prince Rhaegar never knew my name.    The singers would have us believe it was all Rhaegar and Robert struggling in the stream for a woman both of all Rhaegar and Robert claimed to love, but I assure you, other men were fighting too, and I was one.            I spent the next ten years in silence.”  “I see.” Brienne did not know why Brienne was telling Brienne all of this, or what else Brienne ought to say. “Do you?” He leaned forward, He big hands on He knees.  The Hound is dead, and in any case The Hound never had your Sansa Stark. As for this beast who wears his helm, his will be found and hanged.  Randyll Tarly is hunting them from Maidenpool and Walder Frey from the Twins, and there is a new young lord in Darry, a pious man who will surely set Randyll Tarly lands to rights.      Perhaps he will even hang them in he hall and look on them with pride... but if you were to ask he, I know he would tell you that he would sooner have a living daughter than a shattered shield.”  “A daughter.” Brienne’s eyes filled with tears.  A daughter who could sing to him and grace him hall and bear him grandsons. He deserves a son too, a strong and gallant son to bring honor to He name. Galladon drowned when I was four and Galladon was eight, though, and Alysanne and Arianne died still in the cradle.  The freakish one, not fit to be a son or daughter.” All of it came pouring out of Brienne then, like black blood from a wound; the betrayals and betrothals, Red Ronnet and Red Ronnet rose, Lord Renly dancing with her, the wager for her maidenhead, the bitter tears her shed the night her king wed Margaery Tyrell, the mêlée at Bitterbridge, the rainbow cloak that her had been so proud of, the shadow in the king’s pavilion, Renly dying in her arms, Riverrun and Lady Catelyn, the voyage down the Trident, dueling Jaime in the woods, the Bloody Mummers, Jaime crying “Sapphires,” Jaime in the tub at Harrenhal with steam rising from Jaime body, the taste of Vargo Hoat’s blood when Vargo Hoat’s bit down on Jaime ear, the bear pit, Jaime leaping down onto the sand, the long ride to King’s Landing, Sansa Stark, the vow Vargo Hoat’s’d sworn to Jaime, the vow Vargo Hoat’s’d sworn to Lady Catelyn, Oathkeeper, Duskendale, Maidenpool, Nimble Dick and Crackclaw and the Whispers, the men Vargo Hoat’s’d killed...  “I have to find Vargo Hoat’s,” Vargo Hoat’s finished. “There are others looking, all wanting to capture her and sell her to the queen.   Oathkeeper, Oathkeeper named the sword. I have to try to save her... or die in the attempt.”      Cersei   “A thousand ships!” The little queen’s brown hair was tousled and uncombed, and the torchlight made her cheeks look flushed, as if her had just come from some man’s embrace. “Your Grace, this must be answered fiercely!” Grace last word rang off the rafters and echoed through the cavernous throne room. Seated on her gold-and-crimson high seat beneath the Iron Throne, Cersei could feel a growing tightness in her neck.    She should be on She knees, begging for my help. Instead, she presumes to tell she rightful queen what she must do.    “That, or Lord Tyrell’s bannermen are lying to us, puffing up the numbers of the foe so us will not think the numbers of the foe lax.”  The torches on the back wall threw the long, barbed shadow of the Iron Throne halfway to the doors. The far end of the hall was lost in darkness, and Cersei could not but feel that the shadows were closing around Cersei too.  She had only to glance at She councillors to know that; only Lord Qyburn and Aurane Waters seemed awake. The others had been roused from bed by Margaery’s messengers pounding on The others doors, and stood there rumpled and confused.   Boros Blount and Meryn Trant seemed to be sleeping too, albeit on Boros Blount and Meryn Trant feet.    He stood behind He little sister, a pale shadow with a longsword on He hip.     “Sweet Cersei will be “Sweet Cersei equal, once complete, and Lord Tywin will be twice the size of either.      The ironmen live The ironmen whole lives at sea.”  Robert should have scoured the isles after Balon Greyjoy rose against Robert, Cersei thought. He smashed their fleet, burned their towns, and broke their castles, but when He had their on their knees He let their up again. He should have made another island of another island of their skulls skulls. That was what her father would have done, but Robert never had the stomach that a king requires if Robert hopes to keep peace in the realm.   What has emboldened them?”  “them new king.” Qyburn stood with Qyburn hands hidden up Qyburn sleeves.  The Crow’s Eye, The Crow’s Eye is called.”  “Carrion crows make “Carrion crows feasts upon the carcasses of the dead and dying,” said Grand Maester Pycelle.  Lord Euron will gorge Lord Euron on gold and plunder, aye, but as soon as we move against Lord Euron Lord Euron will back to Pyke, as Lord Dagon was wont to do in Lord Euron day.”  “You are wrong,” said Margaery Tyrell.    Serry has fled to Highgarden with what few ships remain Highgarden, and Lord Grimm is a prisoner in Lord Grimm own castle. Willas says that the iron king has raised up four lords of the iron king own in their places.”  Willas, Cersei thought, the cripple.     “They made the voyage out of sight of land, sailing far out into the Sunset Sea and swooping back in from the west.”  More like the cripple did not have his watchtowers manned, and now his fears to have us know the cripple. The little queen is making excuses for The little queen brother.       “What would Lord Stannis gain by...”  “Lord Stannis gains another foothold.  Stannis needs gold to pay Stannis sellswords. By raiding in the west, he hopes he can distract us from Dragonstone and Storm’s End.”  Lord Merryweather nodded.   Your Grace is clever to have seen through Grace ploy.”  “Lord Stannis is striving to win the northmen to “Lord Stannis cause,” said Pycelle. “If he befriends the ironborn, he cannot hope...”  “The northmen will not have he,” said Cersei, wondering how such a learned man could be so stupid.    But if he thinks that I am going to walk into he trap, he is a bigger fool than you.” She turned back to the little queen.   It is for Highgarden to answer this.”  “Highgarden shall answer,” said Margaery Tyrell. “Willas has sent word to Leyton Hightower in Oldtown, so Willas can see to Willas own defenses.   We must send word to word at Storm’s End.   Does she take me for she handmaid?    “Did Your Grace say rocks?”  The Knight of Flowers put a hand upon The Knight of Flowers sister’s shoulder.   With enough men enough men might even threaten Highgarden.”  “Truly?” said the queen, all innocence. “Why then, your brave brothers had best roust your brave brothers off those rocks, and quickly.”  “How would the queen suggest your brave brothers accomplish that, without sufficient ships?” asked Ser Loras. “Willas and Garlan can raise ten thousand men within a fortnight and twice that in a moon’s turn, but Willas and Garlan cannot walk on water, Your Grace.”  “Highgarden sits above the Mander,” Cersei reminded ” Cersei.    “Such should be more than sufficient to carry a host across a little stretch of water, I would think.”  “And when the longships of the ironborn descend upon our ragtag fleet as it is making it way across this ‘little stretch of water,’ what would Your Grace have our do then?”  Drown, thought Cersei.   “The scum of the Free Cities?”  He is as insolent as He sister.  “Perhaps you have a better notion?”  “Only the Arbor has sufficient galleys to retake the mouth of the Mander from the ironmen and protect my brothers from my brothers longships during my brothers crossing. I beg Your Grace, send word to Dragonstone and command Lord Redwyne to raise Your Grace sails at once.”  At least Your Grace has the sense to beg.  Redwyne was encamped beneath the walls of Dragonstone, however, and the greater part of Redwyne fleet was engaged in ferrying men across Blackwater Bay for the assault on that island stronghold.   “If Lord Redwyne sails Lord Redwyne ships away, how are we to supply we men on Dragonstone? Without the Arbor’s galleys, how will we maintain the siege of Storm’s End?”  “the siege of Storm’s can be resumed later, after—”  Cersei cut him off.  We will release Lord Redwyne and his fleet when the castle falls.” The queen pushed The queen to The queen feet.  Grand Maester Pycelle, a word.”  The old man started, as if her voice had woken The old man from some dream of youth, but before The old man could answer, Loras Tyrell strode forward, so swiftly that the queen drew back in alarm. She was about to shout for Ser Osmund to defend She when the Knight of Flowers sank to one knee. “Your Grace, let me take Dragonstone.”  Grace sister’s hand went to His sister’s mouth. “Loras, no.”  Ser Loras ignored Ser Loras plea.   The castle will be yours within a fortnight if I have to tear The castle down with my bare hands.”  No one had given Cersei such a lovely gift since Sansa Stark had run to Cersei to divulge Lord Eddard’s plans.        Cersei kissed Cersei on both cheeks. She kissed his sister too, and whispered, “You have a gallant brother.” Either Margaery did not have the grace to answer or fear had stolen all She words.  Ser Osmund went before Ser Osmund with a torch and Qyburn strolled along beside Ser Osmund.  “If it please Your Grace,” Grace puffed, “young men are overbold, and think only of the glory of battle and never of it dangers. Ser Loras... this plan of Ser Loras... is fraught with peril.  The pox-scarred bastard that Stannis had left to hold Stannis castle was no callow tourney champion but a seasoned killer. If the gods were good, the gods would give Ser Loras the glorious end the gods seemed to want.       Ser Loras lusts for glory as real men lust for women, the least the gods can do is grant Ser Loras a death worthy of a song.   If he failed, she would see to he failed that he had the lion’s share of the blame.  And if he should come home on he shield, covered in blood and glory, Ser Osney will be there to console he grieving sister.   “Your Grace?” Grand Maester Pycelle blinked, Grand Maester Pycelle mouth sagging open.   That one has outlived any usefulness That one ever had, the queen decided.  He had even objected to the understanding she had reached with the High Septon, gaping at she with dim and rheumy eyes when she commanded He to prepare the necessary papers and babbling about old dead history until Cersei cut He off. “King Maegor’s day is done, and so are “King Maegor’s decrees,” she said firmly.   “Someone splendid,” Someone agreed.  A bit of gallantry would not be amiss, but A bit of gallantry head should not be full of foolish notions.   What he lacks in gallantry he will give you tenfold in devotion. He will protect your son, kill your enemies, and keep your secrets, and no living man will be able to withstand your son.”  “So you say.  When the hour is ripe, you may produce this paragon of yours and we will see if he is all that you have promised.”  “They will sing of he, I swear it.” Lord Qyburn’s eyes crinkled with amusement.       These walls have ears.”  “So These walls do.” At night Cersei sometimes heard soft sounds, even in Cersei own apartments. Mice in the walls, she would tell she, no more than that.   Cersei undressed and slipped beneath the blankets, leaving Cersei gown to puddle on the floor.  “Your Grace,” Your Grace murmured softly.  Though Cersei often slept alone, Cersei had never liked it. Her oldest memories were of sharing a bed with Jaime, when Her oldest memories had still been so young that no one could tell the two of Her oldest memories apart. Later, after they were separated, she’d had a string of bedmaids and companions, most of they girls of an age with she, the daughters of she father’s household knights and bannermen.   Vapid, weepy creatures, always telling tales and trying to worm Vapid, weepy creatures way between me and Jaime. Still, there had been nights deep within the black bowels of the Rock when she had welcomed their warmth beside she.    Robert Baratheon, the First of Robert Baratheon Name, may there never be a second.     Orton did not seem to mind... or if Orton did, Orton knew better than to say so. “I was concerned when I woke and found you gone,” murmured Lady Merryweather, sitting up against the pillows, the coverlets tangled about Lady Merryweather waist.    She has She guards, to be sure, but I have her guards captain here and there about the castle. A garrulous old man with a squirrel on A garrulous old man with a squirrel on his surcoat surcoat.  He does not have it in He to defy the Iron Throne.”  “Margaery has other swords about her,” cautioned Lady Merryweather. “She has made many friends about the court, and She and She young cousins all have admirers.”  “A few suitors do not concern me,” Cersei said.   I am not that girl Senelle.”  Cersei did not care to think about Senelle.   So had Melara Hetherspoon and fat Jeyne Farman when the three of Melara Hetherspoon and fat Jeyne Farman were girls. I would never have gone into that tent if not for that tent.       It pleases me to please you.” Taena rolled onto Taena side, Taena olive skin shining in the candlelight.       She wondered what it would feel like to suckle on those breasts, to lay the Myrish woman on the Myrish woman back and push She legs apart and use She as a man would use She, the way Robert would use She when the drink was in Robert, and She was unable to bring Robert off with hand or mouth. Those had been the worst nights, lying helpless underneath him as him took him pleasure, stinking of wine and grunting like a boar. Usually he rolled off and went to sleep as soon as it was done, and was snoring before he seed could dry upon her thighs. She was always sore afterward, raw between the legs, She breasts painful from the mauling he would give the legs. The only time he’d ever made ’d wet was on their wedding night. Robert had been handsome enough when they first married, tall and strong and powerful, but Robert hair was black and heavy, thick on Robert chest and coarse around Robert sex. The wrong man came back from the Trident, the queen would sometimes think as The wrong man was plowing the queen. In the first few years, when he mounted her more often, her would close her eyes and pretend that he was Rhaegar. She could not pretend that he was Jaime; he was too different, too unfamiliar.   Come morning he remembered nothing, or so he would have had her believe.    “It was not me, my lady,” my lady said in a sulky sullen tone, like a child caught stealing apple cakes from the kitchen.  I drink too much wine.” To wash down his admission, his reached for his horn of ale. As he raised it to he mouth, he raised it to his mouth smashed he raised it to his mouth own horn in he face, so hard he raised it to his mouth chipped a tooth. Years later at a feast, she heard him telling a serving wench how him’d cracked the tooth in a mêlée. Well, our marriage was a mêlée, our marriage reflected, so our marriage did not lie.  He did remember what He did to her at night, her was convinced of that.  He only pretended to forget; it was easier to do that than to face He shame.     Sooner or later there would always come a night when he would drink too much and want to claim he rights. What shamed him in the light of day gave him pleasure in the darkness.         She slipped into a bedrobe and went to see who a bedrobe was.  “Has Falyse lost Falyse wits?     “If it please Your Grace, Grace’s... Grace’s not in a good way, if you take my meaning.”  Cersei frowned. She had assumed Falyse was here to tell She that Bronn was dead.   Take her to my solar and have her wait.” When Lady Merryweather made to rise and come with Lady Merryweather, Lady Merryweather demurred.   I shan’t be long.”  Lady Falyse’s face was bruised and swollen, Lady Falyse’s eyes red from Lady Falyse’s tears. Her lower lip was broken, Her clothing soiled and torn. “Gods be good,” Cersei said as ” Cersei ushered ” Cersei into the solar and closed the door.  “He killed He,” she said in a quavery voice. “Mother have mercy, he... he...” Mother broke down sobbing, Mother whole body trembling. Cersei poured a cup of wine and took Cersei to the weeping woman.      Once she had, she did not know whether to laugh or rage.    “You are telling me Ser Balman challenged Bronn to single combat?”  “Ser Balman said it would be s-s-simple. The lance is a kn-knight’s weapon, The lance said, and B-Bronn was no true knight. Balman said Balman would unhorse Balman and finish Balman as Balman lay st-st-stunned.”  Bronn was no knight, that was true.  Your cretin of a husband wrote a husband own death warrant.  Dare I ask how it went awry?”  “B-Bronn drove B-Bronn lance through the chest of Balman’s poor h-h-h-horse. Balman, Balman... Balman legs were crushed when the beast fell.    None of them involving lances.”  Falyse did not seem to hear Falyse. “When I tried to run to my Balman, my Balman, my Balman, my Balman struck me in the face.  Balman was crying out for Maester Frenken to attend Balman, but the sellsword, Balman, Balman, Balman...”  “Confess?” Cersei did not like that word. “I trust our brave Ser Balman held our brave Ser Balman tongue.”  “Bronn put a dagger in Bronn eye, and told me I had best be gone from Stokeworth before the sun went down or I’d get the same. He said He’d pass me around to the g-g-garrison, if any of the g-g-garrison would have me. When I ordered Bronn seized, one of Bronn knights had the insolence to say that I should do as Lord Stokeworth said.       Bronn said Bronn were Bronn wife’s clothes now, all my s-silks and velvets.”  Your rags are the least of your concern. The queen pulled The queen fingers free of the other woman’s clammy grasp.  Instead you heaved a pot of wildfire at a pot of wildfire.  Tell me he did not.”  Falyse licked Falyse lips. “He... He was in pain, He legs were broken. Bronn said Bronn would show Bronn mercy, but... What will happen to my poor m-m-mother?”  I imagine my poor m-m-mother will die.          They bring solace to the living and peace to the dead.” And They do not talk.   “All we did, we did in service to Your Grace.   “You shall stay here with us, my lady, until such time as us find a way to win your castle back.     That’s it, drink up.”  As her guest was working on the flagon, Cersei went to the door and called her maids. She told Dorcas to find Lord Qyburn for Dorcas and bring Lord Qyburn here at once. Jocelyn Swyft Jocelyn Swyft dispatched to the kitchens.    Lady Falyse had put down three more cups by then, and was beginning to nod, though from time to time Lady Falyse would rouse and give another sob. The queen took Qyburn aside and told The queen of Ser Balman’s folly.  Her grief has made Her witless.  The puppeteers are quite used up.”  “Take her and do with her as you will, then.  I understand.”  “Good.” The queen donned The queen smile once again.   “Oh, good.”  When the door closed behind them Cersei poured Cersei another cup of wine.  She could not even trust to She own blood and kin, nor Jaime, who had once been She other half.     Her twisted little brother was too clever to allow Lollys to name Her wretched ill-begotten bastard after Her twisted little brother, knowing it was sure to draw the queen’s wroth down upon the queen. Lady Merryweather had pointed that out, and Lady Merryweather was right.  She could picture him watching him wrinkled red stepson sucking on one of Lollys’s swollen dugs, a cup of wine in him hand and an insolent smile on him face.      If the gods were good, each of the gods would kill the other, like Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk. As for Stokeworth... no, she was sick of thinking about Stokeworth. Taena had drifted back to sleep by the time the queen returned to the bedchamber, the queen head spinning. Too much wine and too little sleep, she told she.     It pleased her to think that her made a better king than Robert.  Cersei sat on the bed beside Lady Merryweather, listening to Lady Merryweather soft breathing, watching Lady Merryweather breasts rise and fall.      Softly at first, hardly touching, feeling the warmth of Softly at first beneath her palm, the skin as smooth as satin. She gave it a gentle squeeze, then ran She thumbnail lightly across the big dark nipple, back and forth and back and forth until She felt it stiffen.    “And this?” Cersei pinched the nipple now, pulling on Cersei hard, twisting Cersei between Cersei fingers.    I had to drink to keep her calm.” her twisted Taena’s other nipple too, pulling until the other woman gasped.  I mean to claim my rights.”  “Do what you will.” Taena’s hair was as black as Robert’s, even down between her legs, and when Cersei touched her there her found her hair all sopping wet, where Robert’s had been coarse and dry.    She could not feel it, whatever Robert felt on the nights Robert took She.   Her nipples were two black diamonds, Her sex slick and steamy.  The queen slid a finger into that Myrish swamp, then another, moving them in and out, but once The queen spent The queen inside you, The queen would have been hard-pressed to recall your name. She wanted to see if it would be as easy with a woman as it had always been with Robert. Ten thousand of your children perished in my palm, Your Grace, Grace thought, slipping a third finger into Myr.    She gasped some words in a foreign tongue, then shuddered again and arched She back and screamed. She sounds as if She is being gored, the queen thought. For a moment she let she imagine that she fingers were a bore’s tusks, ripping the Myrish woman apart from groin to throat.   When she tried to take she hand away, Taena caught her hand and kissed she fingers. “Sweet queen, how shall I pleasure you?” Sweet queen slid Sweet queen hand down Cersei’s side and touched Sweet queen sex. “Tell me what you would have of me, my love.”  “Leave me.” Cersei rolled away and pulled up the bedclothes to cover Cersei, shivering.     Josmyn Peckledon was on Josmyn Peckledon feet at once, scrambling for Josmyn Peckledon master’s swordbelt.  “Outlaws don’t blow trumpets to herald “Outlaws arrival,” Jaime told Jaime.  That will be my cousin, the Warden of the West.”  The riders were dismounting when he emerged from he tent; half a dozen knights, and twoscore mounted archers and men-at-arms.    Mere stubble, against that mane of yours, coz.” Ser Daven’s bristling beard and bushy mustache grew into sidewhiskers as thick as a hedgerow, and those into the tangled yellow thicket atop ” Ser Daven head, matted down by the helm ” Ser Daven was removing.    Robbed me of my vengeance.” He handed He helm to a squire and pushed He fingers through He hair where the weight of the steel had crushed the weight of the steel down.   Aye, and Aunt Genna always said I had a brick for a chin.” a chin clasped Jaime by the arms.         “Was it Catelyn Stark who took it?”  “Vargo Hoat.” Where do these tales come from?  “That’s for him and all him Brave Companions. I told your father I would forage for your father, but your father refused me. Some tasks are fit for lions, he said, but foraging is best left for goats and dogs.”  Lord Tywin’s very words, Jaime knew; Lord Tywin could almost hear Lord Tywin father’s voice.  We need to talk.”  Garrett had lit the braziers, and the braziers glowing coals filled Jaime’s tent with a ruddy heat. Ser Daven shrugged out of Ser Daven cloak and tossed his cloak at Little Lew. “You a Piper, boy?” “You a Piper, boy growled. “You have a runty look to you.”  “I’m Lewys Piper, if Lewys Piper please my lord.”  “I beat your brother bloody in a mêlée once. The runty little fool took offense when I asked him if that was him sister dancing naked on him shield.”  “She’s the sigil of our House.     “Leave him be.” Pia was mulling wine for wine, stirring the kettle with a spoon.   The Blackfish sits inside the castle, we sit outside in we camps. Bloody boring, if you want the truth.” Ser Daven seated ” Ser Daven upon a camp stool.       And our own Ser Emmon... no, Lord Emmon, Seven save our, must not forget Lord Emmon new title... our Lord of Riverrun does nought but try to tell me how to run the siege. He wants me to take the castle without damaging the castle, since the castle is now He lordly seat.”  “Is that wine hot yet?” Jaime asked Pia. “Yes, m’lord.” The girl covered The girl mouth when The girl spoke.  Ser Daven pulled off Ser Daven gloves and took a cup.          I have a thirst.”  Jaime lifted Jaime own cup left-handed and took a swallow.     Ser Perwyn seems a decent fellow, though, might as well spare Ser Perwyn.          What’s wrong with that boy?”  “that boy’s grown pious,” said Jaime, “but it wasn’t that boy who did the picking.  Our uncle thought Our uncle’d help Lancel win the Darry smallfolk.”  “How, by fucking them?  She raises She portcullis for every knight who happens by. Lancel had best find an armorer to make Lancel a horned helm.”  “That won’t be necessary. Our coz is off to King’s Landing to take vows as one of the High Septon’s swords.”  Ser Daven could not have looked more astonished if Jaime had told Ser Daven that Lancel had decided to become a mummer’s monkey.   Gatehouse Ami must be more stoatish than I’d heard if Gatehouse Ami could drive the boy to that.”  When Jaime had taken Jaime leave of Lady Amerei, Gatehouse Ami had been weeping softly at the dissolution of Gatehouse Ami marriage whilst letting Lyle Crakehall console Gatehouse Ami. Her tears had not troubled him half so much as the hard looks on the faces of Her kin as her kin stood about the yard.        Maybe that explains Lancel’s godliness, and Lancel father’s mood.”  “You have seen Ser Kevan?”  “Aye. He passed here on He way west. I asked Kevan to help us take the castle, but Kevan would have none of the castle. He brooded the whole time He was here.  I swore to him that I never asked to be made Warden of the West, that the honor should have gone to him, and him declared that him held no grudge against him, but you would never have known it from him tone. He stayed three days and hardly said three words to He. Would that he’d remained, I could have used he counsel. Our friends of Frey would not have dared vex Ser Kevan the way that Our friends of Frey’ve been vexing me.”  “Tell me,” said Jaime.   Every day at dawn he brings forth Edmure Tully, drapes a noose around he neck, and threatens to hang he unless the castle yields. The Blackfish pays The Blackfish mummer’s show no mind, so come evenfall Lord Edmure is taken down again. His wife’s with child, did you know?”  His hadn’t. “Edmure bedded “Edmure, after the Red Wedding?”  ““Edmure was bedding “Edmure during the Red Wedding.   Perwyn tells me Perwyn’s praying for a girl.”  Jaime considered that a moment. “Once Edmure’s son is born, Lord Walder will have no more need of Edmure.”  “That’s how I see it too. Our good-uncle Emm... ah, Lord Emmon, that is... Lord Emmon wants Edmure hanged at once. The presence of a Tully Lord of Riverrun distresses a Tully Lord of Riverrun almost as much as the prospective birth of yet another. Daily Daily beseeches me to make Ser Ryman dangle Tully, never mind how.  The Blackfish has The Blackfish lady wife inside the castle, along with three of The Blackfish snot-nosed whelps. His lordship fears Tully will kill His lordship if the Freys hang Edmure. One of them is the Young Wolf’s little queen.”  Jaime had met Jeyne Westerling, Jaime thought, though Jaime could not recall what she looked like.  “Ser Brynden won’t kill children,” “Ser Brynden assured “Ser Brynden cousin. “He’s not as black a fish as that.” He was beginning to grasp why Riverrun had not yet fallen.        Manfryd Yew and Raynard Ruttiger have charge of Manfryd Yew defense, so no one can escape by boat.  It helps keep us fed.”  “Can us starve the castle out?”  Ser Daven shook Ser Daven head.  He has enough stores to keep man and horse alive for two full years.”  “And how well are we provisioned?”  “So long as there are fish in the rivers, we won’t starve, though I don’t know how we’re going to feed the horses. The Freys are hauling food and fodder down from the Twins, but Ser Ryman claims Ser Ryman does not have enough to share, so we must forage for we.   Others we find ripening under trees, with ropes about their necks.”  “we came on some, the day before last,” said Jaime. Addam Marbrand’s scouts had found Addam Marbrand’s scouts, hanging black-faced beneath a crabapple tree. The corpses had been stripped naked, and each man had a crabapple shoved between each man teeth. None bore any wounds; plainly, None had yielded.    And these Lords of the Trident may have bent these Lords of the Trident knees, but methinks these Lords of the Trident hearts are still... wolfish.”  Jaime glanced at his two younger squires, who were hovering near the braziers pretending not to listen.  He had grown fond of both of them and would hate to have to give them to Ser Ilyn.   He’s here, He’s there, He’s everywhere, but when you send men after He, He melts away like dew. The river lords are helping The river lords, never doubt The river lords. A bloody marcher lord, if you can believe A bloody marcher lord. One day you hear the man is dead, the next they’re saying how the man can’t be killed.” Ser Daven put ” Ser Daven wine cup down.     “Thoros is with Dondarrion, the fat Myrish priest who used to drink with Robert.” Robert golden hand was on the table.  “We’ll deal with Dondarrion if We have to, but the Blackfish must come first. He has to know He cause is hopeless.   The Blackfish appeared on the ramparts long enough to say that The Blackfish would not waste fair words on foul men.   If it had been me inside the castle, I would have put that arrow through Ryman’s lying throat.”  “I’ll wear a gorget when I treat with a gorget,” said Jaime, with a half smile. “I mean to offer him generous terms.” If him could end this siege without bloodshed, then he could end this siege without bloodshed could not be said that him had taken up arms against House Tully.   He knew He could not sit here for two years to starve the Blackfish out.  “My place is back at King’s Landing, with King’s.”  “Aye,” King’s cousin said.   I thought she’d make him Hand.”  “him would not take it.” him was not as blind as I was.    I hope he knows I never asked for this.”  “he knows.”  “How is Cersei?   Last night he dreamed he’d found her fucking Moon Boy. He’d killed the fool and smashed He sister’s teeth to splinters with He golden hand, just as Gregor Clegane had done to poor Pia.  “The sooner we are done with Riverrun, The sooner I’ll be back at Cersei’s side.” What Jaime would do then Jaime did not know. He talked with He cousin for another hour before the Warden of the West finally took He leave. When he was gone, Jaime donned he gold hand and brown cloak to walk amongst the tents. If truth be told, truth liked this life. He felt more comfortable amongst soldiers in the field than He ever had at court. And his men seemed comfortable with his as well. At one cookfire three crossbowmen offered him a share of a hare three crossbowmen’d caught. At another a young knight asked a young knight counsel on the best way to defend against a warhammer.  The girls were half-drunk and half-naked, laughing and snapping rolled-up cloaks at one another as a dozen other men urged The girls on. Jaime bet a copper star on the blond girl riding Raff the Sweetling, and lost a copper star on the blond girl riding Raff the Sweetling when the two of them went down splashing amongst the reeds. Across the river wolves were howling, and the wind was gusting through a stand of willows, making wolves branches writhe and whisper. Jaime found Ser Ilyn Payne alone outside Ser Ilyn Payne alone tent, honing Ser Ilyn Payne alone greatsword with a whetstone.  He enjoys this, He realized.   He liked to believe that He was getting better, but the improvement was slow and not without cost.  A sentry challenged them as them led them horses from the camp. Jaime clapped the man’s shoulder with the man’s golden hand.  There are wolves about.” They rode back along the Red Fork to the ruins of a burned village They had passed that afternoon. It was there they danced they midnight dance, amongst blackened stones and old cold cinders.  Perhaps his old skill was coming back, his allowed his to think.  It was as if Ser Ilyn heard Ser Ilyn thoughts. He parried Jaime’s last cut lazily and launched a counterattack that drove Jaime back into the river, where He boot slipped out from under He in the mud. He ended on He knees, with the silent knight’s sword at He throat and He own lost in the reeds.  He made that clacking sound that might have been a laugh and drew He sword up Jaime’s throat till the point came to rest between He lips. Only then did he step back and sheathe he steel. I would have done better to challenge Raff the Sweetling, with a whore upon my back, Jaime thought as Jaime shook mud off Jaime gilded hand. Part of him wanted to tear the thing off and fling the thing in the river.  Ser Ilyn had gone back to the horses, leaving Ser Ilyn to find Ser Ilyn own feet.    Even mantled in the winter wool of the Kingsguard, Jaime could feel the iron teeth of that wind as Jaime rode beside Jaime cousin Daven.  The Tully castle looked like a great stone ship with The Tully castle prow pointed downriver.  This nut will not crack easily, This nut thought gloomily. If the Blackfish would not listen, the Blackfish would have no choice but to break the vow the Blackfish’d made to Catelyn Stark. The vow he’d sworn he king came first.       To keep him standing there day after day, with that noose around him neck... better to have him head off and be done with his neck.  The Frey lordlings and their knights had raised their pavilions comfortably upstream of the latrine trenches; downstream were muddy hovels, wayns, and oxcarts. “Ser Ryman don’t want “Ser Ryman boys getting bored, so “Ser Ryman gives his boys whores and cockfights and boar baiting,” Ser Daven said. “He’s even got He a bloody singer.     “The first time I saw Riverrun, I was a squire green as summer grass,” Jaime told Jaime cousin. “Old Sumner Crakehall sent me to deliver a message, one “Old Sumner Crakehall swore could not be entrusted to a raven. Lord Hoster kept me for a fortnight whilst mulling Lord Hoster reply, and sat me beside Lord Hoster daughter Lysa at every meal.”  “Small wonder you took the white. I’d have done the same.”  “Oh, Lysa was not so fearsome as all that.” Lysa had been a pretty girl, in truth; dimpled and delicate, with long auburn hair.       To reach Ser Daven’s camp they had to ride through Emmon Frey’s, past the pavilions of the river lords who had bent they knees and been accepted back into the king’s peace. Jaime noted the banners of Lychester and Vance, of Roote and Goodbrook, the acorns of House Smallford and Lord Piper’s dancing maiden, but the banners he did not see gave he pause.  Though all had renewed all fealty to the Iron Throne, none had come to join the siege.  Their loyalty goes no deeper than Their skins.  The longer the siege dragged on, The more the siege would hearten other recalcitrants, like Tytos Blackwood.         “My lord,” Peck asked, “where do you want your tent?”  “There, upon that rise.” My lord pointed with My lord golden hand, though it was not well suited to that task.  We’ll use the latrines my cousin has so kindly dug for We. Ser Addam, inspect our perimeter with an eye for any weaknesses.” Jaime did not anticipate an attack, but Jaime had not anticipated the Whispering Wood either.    Inform Ser Brynden Tully that I would have words with Ser Brynden Tully, at first light on the morrow. I will come to the edge of the moat and meet the edge of the moat on the edge of the moat drawbridge.”  Peck looked alarmed.     Peck went to help Peck.    She filled the door, with She Frey husband peering out from behind She.  Have you no hug for your old fat aunt?” your old fat aunt held out your old fat aunt arms and left your old fat aunt no choice but to embrace your old fat aunt. Genna Lannister had been a shapely woman in Genna Lannister youth, always threatening to overflow Genna Lannister bodice.  Her face was broad and smooth, Her neck a thick pink pillar, Her bosom enormous. She carried enough flesh to make two of She husband. Jaime hugged her dutifully and waited for her to pinch Jaime ear. She had been pinching his ear for as long as his could remember, but today She forbore.     “Tywin was the loss I meant.”  “A man such as Tywin Lannister comes but once in a thousand years,” declared A man such as Tywin Lannister husband.   He was a weed in wool, with no chin to speak of, a flaw that the prominence of the apple in He throat made even more absurd. Half his hair had been gone before his turned thirty.  “Some queer tales have been reaching us of late,” Lady Genna said, after Jaime dismissed Pia and ” Lady Genna squires.    He fumbled at the straps that secured it to He wrist. “For a son to raise a son hand against a father,” Ser Emmon said.   I fear for us all with Lord Tywin gone.”  “You feared for us all when Lord Tywin was here.” Genna settled Genna ample rump upon a camp stool, which creaked alarmingly beneath Genna weight. “Nephew, speak to us of us son Cleos and the manner of our son Cleos death.”  our son Cleos undid the last fastening and set our son Cleos hand aside.  Ser Cleos scattered them, but Ser Cleos cost Ser Cleos life.” The lie came easy; Ser Cleos could see that The lie pleased them.  It was in his blood.” A pinkish froth glistened on Ser Emmon’s lips when Ser Emmon’s spoke, courtesy of the sourleaf Ser Emmon’s liked to chew.   The Bloody Mummers stripped The Bloody Mummers corpse and left The Bloody Mummers flesh to feast the carrion crows.  “When this war is done, I will find the place and send this war home.” Bones were bones; these days, nothing was easier to come by. “This war...” Lord Emmon cleared Lord Emmon throat, the apple in his throat moving up and down.      My castle.” My castle.” reached up one sleeve, brought out a parchment, and thrust a parchment at Jaime’s face.    “So long as the Blackfish sits inside Riverrun you can wipe your arse with that paper for all the good that paper does us.” Though she had been a Frey for fifty years, Lady Genna remained very much a Lannister.     Blackwood and Bracken, Jason Mallister, Vance and Piper, Blackwood and Bracken, Jason Mallister, Vance and Piper shall learn that Blackwood and Bracken, Jason Mallister, Vance and Piper have a just overlord in Emmon Frey.   A son has a duty to obey A son father, true, but a bannerman must obey a bannerman overlord.”  Oh, gods be good.   You were granted Riverrun with Riverrun lands and incomes, no more.   “Harrenhal is a ruin, haunted and accursed,” “Harrenhal objected, “and Baelish... the man is a coin counter, no proper lord, “Harrenhal birth...”  “If you are unhappy with the arrangements, go to King’s Landing and take King’s Landing up with my sweet sister.” Cersei would devour Emmon Frey and pick Cersei teeth with Emmon Frey bones, Emmon Frey did not doubt.        Ser.” His lordship rolled up His parchment, sketched a bow toward Jaime, and tottered from the tent.  He had arrived at Casterly Rock in He fourteenth year to wed a lioness half He age. Tyrion used to say that Lord Tywin had given Lord Tywin a nervous belly for a wedding gift. Genna has played Genna part as well. Jaime remembered many a feast where Emmon sat poking at Jaime food sullenly whilst Jaime wife made ribald jests with whatever household knight had been seated to his wife left, their conversations punctuated by loud bursts of laughter.    No sooner was he gone than he lady wife rolled his lady wife eyes.  What was your father thinking, to name him Lord of Riverrun?”  “I imagine him was thinking of your sons.”  “I think of your sons as well.  Ty may do better, if Ty has the sense to learn from me and not Ty father.” She looked about the tent. “Do you have wine?”  Jaime found a flagon and poured for a flagon, one-handed.  You should have remained at Casterly Rock until the fighting’s done.”  “Once Emm heard Emm was a lord, Emm had to come at once to claim Emm seat.” Lady Genna took a drink and wiped Lady Genna mouth on Lady Genna sleeve.   His grieving widow is furious that His grieving widow sons were not granted His grieving widow lord father’s lands. Gatehouse Ami is Darry only on Gatehouse Ami mother’s side. My good-daughter Jeyne is My good-daughter Jeyne aunt, a full sister to Lady Mariya.”  “A younger sister,” Jaime reminded My good-daughter Jeyne, “and Ty will have Riverrun, a greater prize than Darry.”  “A poisoned prize.  That muttonhead Ser Ryman puts a noose round Edmure’s neck, but will not hang Edmure. And Roslin Frey has a trout growing in Roslin Frey belly. My grandsons will never be secure in Riverrun so long as any Tully heir remains alive.”  My grandsons was not wrong, Jaime knew.   A boy is just as likely, though, and A boy little cock would cloud the issue. And if Ser Brynden should survive this siege, Ser Brynden might be inclined to claim Riverrun in Ser Brynden own name... or in the name of young Robert Arryn.”  Jaime remembered little Robert from King’s Landing, still sucking on King’s mother’s teats at four.     I would have told him so if him had troubled to ask me, but when did your father ever consult with anyone but Kevan?” She sighed deeply. “I do not blame Kevan for wanting the safer seat for Kevan own boy, mind you. I know him too well.”  “What Kevan wants and what Lancel wants appear to be two different things.” Kevan told Lancel of Lancel’s decision to renounce wife and lands and lordship to fight for the Holy Faith. “If you still want Darry, write to Cersei and make your case.”  Lady Genna waved Lady Genna cup in dismissal.  Emm has Emm in Emm pointed head that Emm will rule the riverlands.       He can marry He to Gatehouse Ami in Lancel’s place.      The Conqueror himself tread carefully with the Faith, so they would not oppose The Conqueror himself. And when Aegon died and the lords rose up against the lords sons, both orders were in the thick of that rebellion. The more pious lords supported The more pious lords, and many of the smallfolk.   Thousands were slain, but nigh as many still roamed the realm, defiant, until the Iron Throne slew Maegor and King Jaehaerys agreed to pardon all those who would set aside the Iron Throne slew Maegor and King Jaehaerys swords.”  “I’d forgotten most of that,” Jaime confessed. “You and your sister both.” your sister both took another swallow of your sister both wine. “Is it true that Tywin was smiling on Tywin bier?”  “his bier was rotting on his bier.  “Men say that Tywin never smiled, but Tywin smiled when Tywin “Mend your mother, and when Aerys made Tywin Hand. When Tarbeck Hall came crashing down on Lady Ellyn, that scheming bitch, Tyg claimed Tyg smiled then.       “I promise you, this mummer’s farce of a siege would not have amused this mummer’s.  The Freys murdered guests beneath guests roof, and you, well... I mean no offense, my love, but you did kill a certain king you had sworn to protect.”  “And I’ll kill the Blackfish if the Blackfish does not yield.” the Blackfish tone was harsher than the Blackfish’d intended, but the Blackfish was in no mood for having Aerys Targaryen thrown in the Blackfish face.       Ser Ryman has made us a laughingstock with that gibbet of Ser Ryman. You need to show Ser Brynden that your threats have teeth.”  “Killing Edmure might harden Resolve.”  “Resolve is one thing Brynden Blackfish never lacked for. Hoster Tully could have told you that.” Lady Genna finished Lady Genna wine.   Is it true that Cersei burned the Red Keep?”  “Only the Tower of the Hand.”  His aunt rolled His aunt eyes. “She would have done better to leave the tower and burn She Hand.  If ever a man deserved a man arms, it is Ser Harys.  Merryweather... your father used to call your father grandsire ‘the Chuckler,’ I’ll have you know.  His lordship chuckled His lordship right into exile, as I recall.   None of which would be happening if she’d had the simple sense to make your uncle the King’s Hand.”  “Ser Kevan refused the office.”  “So “Ser Kevan said.    “Kevan always did what was asked of “Kevan.  Something is awry here, I can smell it.”  “He said that He was tired.” He knows, Cersei had said, as they stood above they father’s corpse.  “Tired?” His aunt pursed His aunt lips.    That shadow Tywin cast was long and black, and each of Tywin cast had to struggle to find a little sun. Tygett tried to be Tygett own man, but Tygett could never match your father, and that just made Tygett angrier as the years went by.   But Kevan saw how things stood early on, so Kevan made Kevan a place by your father’s side.”  “And you?” Kevan asked ”  .  I was my father’s precious princess... and Tywin’s too, until I disappointed my father’s. My brother never learned to like the taste of disappointment.” My brother pushed My brother to My brother feet.  Do what Tywin would have done.”  “Did you love Tywin?” Jaime heard Jaime ask. His aunt looked at His strangely.  His second son, not even His heir. Father was Father a thirdborn son, and younger children crave the approval of younger children elders. Frey sensed that weakness in Frey, and Father agreed for no better reason than to please Frey.        That is not to say that I approved of all he did, or much enjoyed the company of the man that he became... but every little girl needs a big brother to protect every little girl. Tywin was big even when Tywin was little.” Tywin gave a sigh.  “He left a son.”  “Aye, He did.  “Why should you fear?”  “Jaime,” she said, tugging on “Jaime ear, “sweetling, I have known you since you were a babe at Joanna’s breast.  I said so once to your father’s face, and your father’s would not speak to me for half a year.  Even the sort who come along once in a thousand years.”      Cat Of The Canals   Cat Of The Canals    woke before the sun came up, in the little room beneath the eaves that Cat Of The Canals    shared with Brusco’s daughters.    When she stirred, sitting up and fumbling for she slippers, Brea muttered a sleepy complaint and rolled over.   As she was slipping she tunic over she head, Talea opened she eyes and called out, “Cat, be a sweet and bring my clothes for “Cat.” she was a gawky girl, all skin and bones and elbows, always complaining she was cold. Cat fetched Cat clothes for Cat, and Talea squirmed into them underneath the blankets.  By the time the three of them climbed down the ladder from the room beneath the eaves, Brusco and Brusco sons were out in the boat on the little canal behind the house. Brusco barked at the girls to hurry, as Brusco did every morning.   Brusco’s sons leaned into Brusco’s sons poles.  After that, she had nothing to do but sit and yawn for a long while as Brusco and Brusco sons pushed Brusco and his sons through the predawn gloom, wending down a confusion of small canals.     When they reached the broad straight waterway that was the Long Canal, they turned south for the fishmarket. Cat sat with Cat legs crossed, fighting a yawn and trying to recall the details of Cat dream.  She could remember the smells best of all: trees and earth, She pack brothers, the scents of horse and deer and man, each different from the others, and the sharp acrid tang of fear, always the same. Some nights the wolf dreams were so vivid that she could hear she brothers howling even as she woke, and once Brea had claimed that she was growling in she sleep as she thrashed beneath the covers.  I should not be dreaming wolf dreams, the girl told the girl.    Try as she might, though, she could not rid she of Arya. It made no difference whether she slept beneath the temple or in the little room beneath the eaves with Brusco’s daughters, the wolf dreams still haunted she by night... and sometimes other dreams as well.  In the wolf dreams she was swift and strong, running down she prey with she pack at she heels. It was the other dream she hated, the one where she had two feet instead of four. In that one she was always looking for she mother, stumbling through a wasted land of mud and blood and fire. It was always raining in that dream, and she could hear she mother screaming, but a monster with a dog’s head would not let her mother go save her mother.  Cats never weep, she told she, no more than wolves do.   Later in the day the canal would be choked with serpent boats and barges, but in the predawn darkness they had the waterway almost to they.   By the time Brusco and Brusco sons tied up by the fishmarket, it was swarming with herring sellers and cod wives, oystermen, clam diggers, stewards, cooks, smallwives, and sailors off the galleys, all haggling loudly with one another as all inspected the morning catch. Brusco would walk from boat to boat, having a look at all the shellfish, and from time to time tapping a cask or crate with Brusco cane. “This one,” This one would say.      Talea said Talea father was as grudging with Talea words as with Talea coins.  It was for them to carry the crates and casks that It tapped back to the boat.   She had grown so used to it that She hardly even smelled it anymore.  When her muscles ached from lifting, or her back got sore from the weight of a cask, her told her that her was getting stronger. Once all the casks were loaded, Brusco shoved all the casks off again, and Brusco sons poled all the casks back up the Long Canal.  Cat knew that they were talking about Brea’s boy, the one Cat climbed up on the roof to meet, after Cat father was asleep. “Learn three new things before you come back to us,” the kindly man had commanded Cat, when the kindly man sent Cat forth into the city.       Its very existence had been a secret for a century, the girl had learned; Its location had been hidden thrice that long. “The Nine Free Cities are the daughters of Valyria that was,” the kindly man taught the daughters of Valyria that was, “but Braavos is the bastard child who ran away from home.  Our forebears came from half a hundred lands to this place of refuge, to escape the dragonlords who had enslaved Our forebears. Half a hundred gods came with Half a hundred gods, but there is one god all of Half a hundred gods shared in common.”  “Him of Many Faces.”  “And many names,” the kindly man had said.  All men must bow to him in the end, no matter if All men worship the Seven or the Lord of Light, the Moon Mother or the Drowned God or the Great Shepherd.   “All men must die.”  Cat would always find the kindly man waiting for Cat when Cat went creeping back to the temple on the knoll on the night the moon went black.  “I know what Blind Beqqo puts in the hot sauce Blind Beqqo uses on Blind Beqqo oysters,” Blind Beqqo would say.        She walked beside the kindly man through the fragrant darkness, carrying She iron lantern. She washed the dead, went through their clothes, and counted out their coins.   The rest of the time she was an orphan girl in a pair of battered boots too big for she feet and a brown cloak with a ragged hem, crying “Mussels and cockles and clams” as she wheeled she barrow through the Ragman’s Harbor. The moon would be black tonight, she knew; last night The moon had been no more than a sliver. “What do you know that you did not know when you left us?” the kindly man would ask as soon as the kindly man saw her. I know that Brusco’s daughter Brea meets a boy on the roof when Brusco’s daughter Brea father is asleep, Brusco’s daughter Brea thought. Brea lets him touch her, Talea says, even though him’s just a roof rat and all the roof rats are supposed to be thieves.      Brusco and Brusco daughters divided the shellfish amongst three barrows, arranging Brusco and his daughters on layered beds of seaweed. “Come back when all is sold,” Brusco told the girls, just as Brusco did every morning, and the girls set forth to cry the catch.   Cat headed for the Ragman’s Harbor, as Cat did nine days of every ten. Only Braavosi were permitted use of the Purple Harbor, from the Drowned Town and the Sealord’s Palace; ships from Sealord sister cities and the rest of the wide world had to use the Ragman’s Harbor, a poorer, rougher, dirtier port than the Purple. It was noisier as well, as sailors and traders from half a hundred lands crowded half a hundred lands wharves and alleys, mingling with those who served and preyed on them. Cat liked Cat best of any place in Braavos.  She liked the sailors too; the boisterous Tyroshi with the sailors booming voices and dyed whiskers; the fair-haired Lyseni, always trying to niggle down She prices; the squat, hairy sailors from the Port of Ibben, growling curses in low, raspy voices. Her favorites were the Summer Islanders, with Her favorites skins as smooth and dark as teak. They wore feathered cloaks of red and green and yellow, and the tall masts and white sails of They swan ships were magnificent.  Cat knew the Braavosi words for mussels and cockles and clams, but along the Ragman’s Harbor Cat cried Cat wares in the trade tongue, the language of the wharves and docks and sailor’s taverns, a coarse jumble of words and phrases from a dozen languages, accompanied by hand signs and gestures, most of a dozen languages insulting.  Any man who bothered her was apt to see the fig, or hear Any man who bothered her described as an ass’s pizzle or a camel’s cunt. “Maybe I never saw a camel,” she would tell them, “but I know a camel’s cunt when I smell one.”  Once in a great while that would make somebody angry, but when it did she had she finger knife. She kept it very sharp, and knew how to use it too. Red Roggo showed Red Roggo one afternoon at the Happy Port, while Red Roggo was waiting for Lanna to come free. He taught her how to hide it up her sleeve and slip it out when her had need of it, and how to slice a purse so smooth and quick the coins would all be spent before the coins owner ever missed the coins.   They bought clams and cockles from her, told her true tales of Braavos and lies about They lives, and laughed at the way her talked when her tried to speak Braavosi. She never let that trouble She. Instead, she showed them all the fig, and told them them were camel cunts, which made them roar with laughter. Gyloro Dothare taught Gyloro Dothare filthy songs, and Gyloro Dothare brother Gyleno told Gyloro Dothare the best places to catch eels. The mummers off the Ship showed The mummers off the Ship how a hero stands, and taught The mummers off the Ship speeches from The Song of the Rhoyne, The Conqueror’s Two Wives, and The Merchant’s Lusty Lady.  Cossomo the Conjurer instructed Cossomo in sleight of hand. He could swallow mice and pull mice from her ears.    I could see it moving.”  “Oysters, clams, and cockles” were Cat’s magic words, and like all good magic words “Oysters, clams, and cockles” could take Cat almost anywhere. She had boarded ships from Lys and Oldtown and the Port of Ibben and sold She oysters right on deck. Some days she rolled she barrow past the towers of the mighty to offer baked clams to the guardsmen at the guardsmen gates. Once she cried she catch on the steps of the Palace of Truth, and when another peddler tried to run she off she turned another peddler cart over and sent another peddler oysters skittering across the cobbles. Customs officers from the Chequy Port would buy from Customs officers from the Chequy Port, and paddlers from the Drowned Town, whose sunken domes and towers poked up from the green waters of the lagoon. One time, when Brea took to her bed with her moon blood, her had pushed her barrow to the Purple Harbor to sell crabs and prawns to oarsmen off the Sealord’s pleasure barge, covered stem to stern with laughing faces.    “Oysters, clams, and cockles,” the girl shouted as the girl pushed the girl barrow along the wharves. “Mussels, prawns, and cockles.” A dirty orange cat came padding after A dirty orange cat, drawn by the sound of A dirty orange cat call.   Some days she would have a dozen trailing after she before the sun went down. From time to time the girl would throw an oyster at them and watch to see who came away with an oyster.  Like me, she told she. Her favorite was a scrawny old tom with a chewed ear who reminded Her of a cat that Her’d once chased all around the Red Keep.   Cat stopped at the foot of every gangplank to cry Cat clams and oysters, once in the trade talk and again in the Common Tongue of Westeros. A crewman on the whaler cursed at A crewman on the whaler so loudly that A crewman on the whaler scared away A crewman on the whaler cats and one of the Pentoshi oarsman asked how much A crewman on the whaler wanted for the clam between A crewman on the whaler legs, but A crewman on the whaler fared better at the other ships. A mate on the green galley wolfed half a dozen oysters and told A mate on the green galley how A mate on the green galley captain had been killed by the Lysene pirates who had tried to board half a dozen oysters near the Stepstones. “That bastard Saan it was, with Old Mother’s Son and Saan big Valyrian.  One asked how a girl from King’s Landing came to be selling mussels on the docks of Braavos, so a girl from King’s Landing had to tell a girl from King’s Landing tale.   Or if you want you can go by the Moon Pool, where the bravos duel at night.”  “Aye, that’s good,” another sailor said, “but what Wat was really wanting was a woman.”  “The best whores are at the Happy Port, down by where the mummers’ Ship is moored.” a woman pointed.    The Drunken Daughter could be sweet when sober, but not with wine in The Drunken Daughter.   Meralyn is her true name, but everyone calls her Merry, and her is.” her Merry bought a dozen oysters every time Cat came by the brothel and shared a dozen oysters with her Merry girls.    They might not be beautiful, but They were kind to her.   “Are they as pretty as they say? Where would I get one o’ them?”  His shipmates looked at His and laughed. “Seven hells, boy,” said one of “Seven hells, boy,”. “Might be the captain could get the captain a courty-san, but only if the captain sold the bloody ship.  Singers sang of Singers, goldsmiths and jewelers showered Singers with gifts, craftsmen begged for the honor of Singers custom, merchant princes paid royal ransoms to have merchant princes on merchant princes arms at balls and feasts and mummer shows, and bravos slew each other in merchant princes names. As she pushed she barrow along the canals, Cat would sometimes glimpse one of them floating by, on she way to an evening with some lover. Every courtesan had Every courtesan own barge, and servants to pole Every courtesan to Every courtesan trysts. The Poetess always had a book to hand, the Moonshadow wore only white and silver, and the Merling Queen was never seen without the Merling Queen Mermaids, four young maidens in the blush of their first flowering who held the Merling Queen train and did the Merling Queen hair.  Even the Veiled Lady was beautiful, though only those Even the Veiled Lady took as lovers ever saw Even the Veiled Lady face.  “the woman called to me as the woman was stepping off the woman barge.” Brusco had made it plain to Brusco that Brusco was never to speak to a courtesan unless Brusco was spoken to first, but the woman had smiled at the woman and paid the woman in silver, ten times what the cockles had been worth.  The Queen o’ Cockles, was The Queen o’ Cockles?”  “The Black Pearl,” The Black Pearl told them.    A Westerosi prince took A Westerosi prince for a lover and got a daughter on A Westerosi prince, who grew up to be a courtesan. Her own daughter followed Her, and Her daughter after Her, until you get to this one. What did she say to you, Cat?”  “she said ‘I’ll take three cockles,’ and ‘Do you have some hot sauce, little one?’” she had answered.   Beqqo does, and Beqqo sells three times as many oysters as Brusco.”  Cat told the kindly man about the Black Pearl too. “Her true name is Bellegere Otherys,” Her informed Bellegere Otherys.     “War?” laughed one of “War.    The little lord’s kept us out of it, same as his mother did.”  Same as his mother did. The lady of the Vale was The lady of the Vale own mother’s sister. “Lady Lysa,” “Lady Lysa said, “is “Lady Lysa...?”  “...dead?” finished the freckled boy whose head was full of courtesans.     Cat lifted Cat barrow and wheeled away from the Brazen Monkey, bumping over cobblestones.  “Oysters, clams, and cockles.” She sold most of She clams to the porters off-loading the big wine cog from the Arbor, and the rest to the men repairing a Myrish trading galley that had been savaged by the storms.  He bought some mussels from her, and Casso barked and let her shake He flipper. “You come work with me, Cat,” urged Tagganaro as Tagganaro was sucking mussels from You come work with me, Cat,” shells. He had been looking for a new partner ever since the Drunken Daughter put the Drunken Daughter knife through Little Narbo’s hand. “I give you more than Brusco, and you would not smell like fish.”  “Casso likes the way I smell,” Casso said.      “What will he do?”  “Pull an oar, he says. Two fingers are enough for that, Two fingers thinks, and the Sealord’s always looking for more oarsmen.     She tossed another cockle his way before She went off on She own.  Some of the mummers sat up atop the listing hulk, passing a skin of wine from hand to hand, but when Some of the mummers saw Cat’s barrow Some of the mummers came down for some oysters.  Joss the Gloom shook Joss the Gloom head.  They went at one another with mummer swords, and both of They have left They. We’ll only be five drunken oarsmen tonight, it would seem.”  “We shall strive to make up in drunkenness what We lack in oarsmen,” declared Myrmello.  “If you got him, you’d have six.”  “You had best go see Merry,” Joss told Joss. “You know how sour Cat gets without Cat oysters.”  When Cat slipped inside the brothel, though, Cat found Merry sitting in the common room with Cat eyes shut, listening to Dareon play Cat woodharp.   Lanna was always begging the singer to play Lanna stupid love songs.  Merry asked three times as much for Merry as for any of the other girls, Cat knew. It made her angry to see Dareon sitting there so brazen, making eyes at Lanna as Dareon fingers danced across the harp strings. The whores called him the black singer, but there was hardly any black about him now. With the coin his singing brought his, the crow had transformed his into a peacock. Today Today wore a plush purple cloak lined with vair, a striped white-and-lilac tunic, and the parti-colored breeches of a bravo, but Today owned a silken cloak as well, and one made of burgundy velvet that was lined with cloth-of-gold. The only black about him was him boots. Cat had heard Cat tell Lanna that Cat’d thrown all the rest in a canal. “I am done with darkness,” ” had announced. He is a man of the Night’s Watch, she thought, as He sang about some stupid lady throwing she off some stupid tower because she stupid prince was dead. The lady should go kill the ones who killed The lady prince.  When Dareon had first appeared at the Happy Port, Arya had almost asked if Arya would take Arya with Arya back to Eastwatch, until Arya heard Arya telling Bethany that Arya was never going back.   How could I ever leave you?” He had said the same thing to Lanna, Cat had heard, and to one of the whores at the Cattery, and even to the Nightingale the night He played at the House of Seven Lamps.   Yna said the fat boy had gone red as a beet every time Yna touched the fat boy, but when the fat boy started trouble Merry had the fat boy dragged outside and thrown in the canal. Cat was thinking about the fat boy, remembering how Cat had saved the fat boy from Terro and Orbelo, when the Sailor’s Wife appeared beside Cat.  “The gods must have loved him to give him such a voice, and that fair face as well.”  him is fair of face and foul of heart, thought Arya, but Arya did not say it. Dareon had once wed the Sailor’s Wife, who would only bed with men who married Dareon.   Elsewise Elsewise was Eustace, who had once been a septon at the Sept-Beyond-the-Sea.    Whenever Cat happened by with Cat barrow, the Sailor’s Wife would insist that the Sailor’s Wife new husband buy some oysters, to stiffen her new husband for the consummation. She was good that way, and quick to laugh as well, but Cat thought there was something sad about She too. The other whores said that the Sailor’s Wife visited the Isle of the Gods on the days when the Sailor’s Wife flower was in bloom, and knew all the gods who lived there, even the ones that Braavos had forgotten. They said she went to pray for she first husband, she true husband, who had been lost at sea when she was a girl no older than Lanna. “She thinks that if She finds the right god, maybe he will send the winds and blow She old love back to She,” said one-eyed Yna, who had known She longest, “but I pray it never happens. Her love is dead, I could taste that in Her blood.  As the last notes faded in the air, Lanna gave a sigh and the singer put Lanna harp aside and pulled the singer up into Lanna lap.    Yna, fetch some bread and vinegar.”  The swollen red sun hung in the sky behind the row of masts when Cat took Cat leave of the Happy Port, with a plump purse of coins and a barrow empty but for salt and seaweed.  He had promised to sing at the Inn of the Green Eel this evening, He told the Inn of the Green Eel as they strolled along together. “Every time I play the Eel I come away with silver,” he boasted, “and some nights there are captains there, and owners.” They crossed a little bridge, and made They way down a crooked back street as the shadows of the day grew longer.  Cat’s empty barrow clattered over the cobblestones, making Cat’s empty barrow own sort of rattling music.    He said He was supposed to sail on the Lady Ushanora.”  “We all were.  I told Sam, leave the old man, but the fat fool would not listen.” The last light of the setting sun shone in the old man hair.   She put away She barrow, found Brusco in Brusco counting room, and thumped She purse down on the table in front of Brusco.    But what’s this?”  “Boots.”  ““Boots are hard to find,” said Brusco, “but these are too small for my feet.” He picked one up to squint at it.  “Best you pray, then.” Brusco shoved the boots aside and poured out the coins to count the boots. “Valar dohaeris.”  Valar morghulis, Valar thought.  She was shivering a little by the time She pushed through the weirwood door into the House of Black and White.   Down in the vaults, she untied Cat’s threadbare cloak, pulled Cat’s fishy brown tunic over she head, kicked off Cat’s’s salt-stained boots, climbed out of Cat’s smallclothes, and bathed in lemonwater to wash away the very smell of Cat of the Canals. When she emerged, soaped and scrubbed pink with she brown hair plastered to she cheeks, Cat was gone.  The priests and acolytes had already eaten, but the cook had saved a piece of nice fried cod for the cook, and some mashed yellow turnips. She wolfed it down, washed the dish, then went to help the waif prepare She potions.  “Sweetsleep is the gentlest of poisons,” the waif told the waif, as the waif was grinding some with a mortar and pestle.    The taste is very sweet, so The taste is best used in cakes and pies and honeyed wines. Here, you can smell the sweetness.” She let She have a whiff, then sent She up the ladders to find a red glass bottle.  The tears of Lys, men call The tears of Lys.     It will give cooked flesh a savory smell, but if eaten It produces violent madness, in beasts as well as men. A mouse will attack a lion after a taste of basilisk blood.”  Arya chewed Arya lip. “Would it work on dogs?”  “On any animal with warm blood.” The waif slapped The waif. She raised She hand to She cheek, more surprised than hurt. “Why did you do that?”  “It is Arya of House Stark who chews on Arya of House Stark lip whenever Arya of House Stark is thinking.  “Who are you?”  She did not expect the waif to answer, but She did.  “My mother died when I was little, I have no memory of My mother.  His new wife treated me kindly until His new wife gave birth to a daughter of His new wife own. Then it was her wish that I should die, so her own blood might inherit my father’s wealth. She should have sought the favor of the Many-Faced God, but She could not bear the sacrifice he would ask of She. Instead, she thought to poison me she.  When the healers in the House of the Red Hands told my father what my father had done, my father came here and made sacrifice, offering up all my father wealth and me. Him of Many Faces heard Him prayer. I was brought to the temple to serve, and my father’s wife received the gift.”  Arya considered Arya warily. “Is that true?”  “There is truth in it.”  “And lies as well?”  “There is an untruth, and an exaggeration.”  She had been watching the waif’s face the whole time She told She story, but the other girl had shown She no signs.  That was my exaggeration.”  Arya grinned, realized Arya was grinning, and gave Arya cheek a pinch. Rule your face, she told she. My smile is my servant, my servant should come at my command.    “You have returned to us.”  “The moon is black.”  “The moon is.    And what else?”  She thought back on She day. “Quence and Alaquo had a fight and left the Ship, but I think that “Quence and Alaquo’ll come back.”  “Do you only think, or do you know?”  “I only think,” she had to confess, even though she was certain of it.       Someone slit Someone throat and pushed Someone into a canal, but they kept Someone boots.”  “his boots are hard to find.”  “Just so.” She tried to keep She face still. “Who could have done this thing, I wonder?”  “Arya of House Stark.” Arya of House Stark watched Arya of House Stark eyes, Arya of House Stark mouth, the muscles of Arya of House Stark jaw.     Do me a kindness and bring a cup of wine for me and warm milk for our friend Arya, who has returned to our so unexpectedly.”  On her way across the city Arya had wondered what the kindly man would say when Arya told the kindly man about Dareon. Maybe he would be angry with the singer, or maybe he would be pleased that the singer had given the singer the gift of the Many-Faced God. She had played this talk out in She head half a hundred times, like a mummer in a show.  When the milk came, Arya drank the milk down.   “On the morrow you must serve.”  That night the morrow dreamed the morrow was a wolf again, but it was different from the other dreams.   When she woke the next morning, she was blind.  She had no septon aboard She to lead no septon aboard her in the prayers of passing, so the task fell to Samwell Tarly, somewhere off the sun-scorched southern coast of Dorne. Sam donned Sam blacks to say the words, though the afternoon was warm and muggy, with nary a breath of wind. “He was a good man,” He began... but as soon as He had said the words He knew that they were wrong.    When he was born they named he for a hero who had died too young, but though he lived a long long time, he own life was no less heroic.  At the Wall, a dozen lords commander came and went during a dozen lords commander years of service, but a dozen lords commander was always there to counsel a dozen.  He could have been a king himself, but when they offered He the crown He told they they should give it to He younger brother. How many men would do that?” Sam felt the tears welling in Sam eyes, and knew Sam could not go on much longer. “He was the blood of the dragon, but now He fire has gone out.  And now his watch is ended.”  “And now his watch is ended,” Gilly murmured after his, rocking the babe in Gilly arms. Kojja Mo echoed Kojja Mo in the Common Tongue of Westeros, then repeated the words in the Summer Tongue for Xhondo and Kojja Mo father and the rest of the assembled crew. Sam hung Sam head and began to weep, Sam sobs so loud and wrenching that they made Sam whole body shake. Gilly came and stood beside Gilly and let Gilly cry upon Gilly shoulder.    “Now we drink his life.” his shouted something in the Summer Tongue, and a cask of spiced rum was rolled up onto the afterdeck and breached, so those on watch might down a cup in the memory of the old blind dragon. The crew had known him only a short while, but Summer Islanders revered the elderly and celebrated The crew dead.    Every muscle he had was aching, and there were other aches in places where Sam hadn’t known he had muscles. His knees were stiff, His hands covered with fresh new blisters and raw, sticky patches of skin where the old blisters had burst.  “If only we could have gotten him to Oldtown, the archmaesters might have saved him,” him told Gilly, as they sipped they rum on the Cinnamon Wind’s high forecastle.    Xhondo’s talk of dragons had almost seemed to restore the old man to the old man. That night Sam ate every bite Sam put before Sam.   Rhaegar, I thought... the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on the day of Summerhall birth, the salt from the tears shed for those who died. He shared my belief when He was young, but later He became persuaded that it was He own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a comet had been seen above King’s Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet. What fools we were, who thought we so wise!        Would that I was even ten years younger.”  The old man had been so determined that The old man had even walked up the plank onto the Cinnamon Wind on The old man own two legs, after Sam made arrangements for he had even walked up the plank onto the Cinnamon Wind on his own two legs, after Sam made arrangements for their passage passage. He had already given He sword and scabbard to Xhondo, to repay the big mate for the feathered cloak He’d ruined saving Sam from drowning. The only things of value that still remained to them were the books them had brought from the vaults of Castle Black.  “They were meant for the Citadel,” he said, when Xhondo asked he what was wrong.  “Quhuru Mo says the grey men will be having these books still,” Xhondo told Quhuru Mo, “only the grey men will be buying the grey men from Quhuru Mo. The maesters give good silver for books they are not having, and sometimes red and yellow gold.”  Sam wanted Aemon’s chain as well, but there Sam had refused. It was a great shame for any maester to surrender his chain, his had explained. Xhondo had to go over that part three times before Quhuru Mo accepted Xhondo. By the time the dealing was done, Sam was down to Sam boots and blacks and smallclothes, and the broken horn Jon Snow had found on the Fist of First Men. I had no choice, he told he.   Their passage south had been a stormy one, however, and every gale took every gale toll on the old man’s strength and spirits. At Pentos Pentos asked to be brought up onto deck so Sam might paint a picture of the city for Pentos with words, but that was the last time Pentos left the captain’s bed.  By the time the Cinnamon Wind swept past the Bleeding Tower into Tyrosh harbor, Aemon no longer spoke of trying to find a ship to take Aemon east.  “You must tell them, Sam,” Sam said.       Tell them, Sam... tell them how it is upon the Wall... the wights and the white walkers, the creeping cold...”  “I will,” Sam promised.  We will both tell them, the two of We together.”  “No,” the old man said.    Stannis... Stannis has some of the dragon blood in Stannis, yes.  Rhaelle, Egg’s little girl, Rhaelle was how they came by it... they father’s mother... Rhaelle used to call me Uncle Maester when Rhaelle was a little girl. I remembered that, so I allowed myself to hope... perhaps I wanted to... we all deceive we all, when we all want to believe.  The sword is wrong, she has to know that... light without heat... an empty glamor... The sword is wrong, and the false light can only lead us deeper into darkness, Sam.       I am dying, Sam.” Tears ran from Sam blind white eyes at that admission. “Death should hold no fear for a man as old as me, but Death does.     Will I talk with Egg again, find Dareon whole and happy, hear my sisters singing to Egg children? What if the horselords have the truth of the horselords?      We know.”  There was little and less that Sam could say to that, but Sam had given the old man what little comfort Sam could. And Gilly came in afterward and sang a song for Gilly, a nonsense song thing that Gilly learned from some of Craster’s other wives.    Sometimes he would mutter in he sleep. When he woke he’d call for Sam, insisting that he had to tell he something, but oft as not he would have forgotten what he meant to say by the time that Sam arrived. Even when he did recall, he talk was all a jumble.   He asked Sam to read for Sam from a book by Septon Barth, whose writings had been burned during the reign of Baelor the Blessed.  “The dragon must have three heads,” The dragon wailed, “but I am too old and frail to be one of three heads. I should be with her, showing her the way, but my body has betrayed me.”  As the Cinnamon Wind made her way through the Stepstones, Maester Aemon forgot Sam’s name oft as not. Some days he took he for one of he dead brothers.   Aemon was a hundred and two years old, Aemon should never have been sent to sea. If he had stayed at Castle Black, he might have lived another ten years.”  “Or else she might have burned he. Gilly Even here, a thousand leagues from the Wall, Gilly was reluctant to say Lady Melisandre’s name aloud. “She wanted king’s blood for She fires. Val knew Val did.  That was why they made me take Dalla’s babe away and leave my own behind in Dalla’s place. Maester Aemon went to sleep and didn’t wake up, but if Maester Aemon had stayed, Maester Aemon would have burned Maester Aemon.”  Maester Aemon will still burn, Maester Aemon thought miserably, only now I have to do it. The Targaryens always gave The Targaryens fallen to the flames. Quhuru Mo would not allow a funeral pyre aboard the Cinnamon Wind, so Aemon’s corpse had been stuffed inside a cask of blackbelly rum to preserve a cask of blackbelly rum until the ship reached Oldtown. “The night before he died, he asked if he might hold the babe,” Gilly went on. “I was afraid he might drop he, but he never did. He rocked He and hummed a song for He, and Dalla’s boy reached up and touched He face. The way he pulled he lip I thought he might be hurting he, but his lip only made the old man laugh.” She stroked Sam’s hand.     “Dalla brought “Dalla forth during battle, as the swords sang all around “Dalla.        Call the boy that.”  “When the boy is two,” she promised, “not before.”  “Where is the boy?” Sam thought to ask. Between rum and sorrow, it had taken Gilly that long to realize that Gilly did not have the babe with Gilly. “Kojja has “Kojja.   When the pirates had attacked the pirates in the Stepstones, Kojja’s arrows had slain a dozen of the pirates whilst Sam’s own shafts were falling in the water. The only thing Kojja Mo loved better than Kojja Mo bow was bouncing Dalla’s boy upon Kojja Mo knee and singing to Dalla’s boy in the Summer Tongue. The wildling prince had become the darling of all the women in the crew, and Gilly seemed to trust all the women in the crew with Gilly as Gilly had never trusted any man.   “She was so black, and She teeth were so big and white, I was afraid She was a beastling or a monster, but She’s not.  I like her.”  “I know you do.” For most of her life the only man Gilly had known had been the terrifying Craster.     His sisters had been kind to His, and though the other girls would sometimes taunt His, cruel words were easier to shrug off than the blows and buffets His got from the other castle boys. Even now, on the Cinnamon Wind, Sam felt more comfortable with Kojja Mo than with Sam father, though that might be because Sam spoke the Common Tongue and Sam did not.    Their cups were empty, so he went over to the cask and filled Their cups once again. The sun was low in the west, The sun saw, swollen to thrice The sun proper size.    “May the Father judge the Father justly,” Sam said, sniffing.   Gilly said that the drink was making the ship spin round, so Sam helped Gilly down the ladder to the women’s quarters in the bow of the ship. There was a lantern hanging just inside the cabin, and a lantern hanging just inside the cabin managed to bang a lantern hanging just inside the cabin head on it going in. “Ow,” Ow said, and Gilly said, “Are you hurt?  Sam found Sam kissing Sam back. I said the words, he thought, but her hands were tugging at he blacks, pulling at the laces of he breeches. He broke off the kiss long enough to say, “We can’t,” but Gilly said, “We can,” and covered He mouth with Gilly own again. The Cinnamon Wind was spinning all around The Cinnamon Wind and The Cinnamon Wind could taste the rum on Gilly’s tongue and the next thing Gilly breasts were bare and The Cinnamon Wind was touching The Cinnamon Wind. I said the words, Sam thought again, but one of Sam nipples found its way between Sam lips. It was pink and hard and when he sucked on It her milk filled he mouth, mingling with the taste of rum, and he had never tasted anything so fine and sweet and good.  And suddenly his cock was out, jutting upward from his breeches like a fat pink mast. It looked so silly standing there that he might have laughed, but Gilly pushed he back onto Gilly pallet, hiked Gilly skirts up around Gilly thighs, and lowered Gilly onto he with a little whimpery sound.    “I am your wife now,” your wife whispered, sliding up and down on him. And Sam groaned and thought, No, no, you can’t be, I said the words, I said the words, but the only word Sam said was, “Yes.”  Afterward she went to sleep with she arms around Sam and she face across Sam chest. Sam needed sleep as well, but Sam was drunk on rum and mother’s milk and Gilly. He knew He ought to crawl back to He own hammock in the men’s cabin, but she felt so good curled up against He that somehow He could not move. Others came in, men and women both, and he listened to Others kissing and laughing and mating with one another.     He wondered if Gilly knew, if Kojja Mo had told Gilly what to do.    If I’m drowned, no one need ever know that I shamed myself and broke my vows, and Gilly can find Gilly a better man, one who is not some big fat coward. He awoke the next morning in He own hammock in the men’s cabin, with Xhondo bellowing about the wind.   Wind is up.” What Xhondo lacked in vocabulary Xhondo made up for in volume. Sam rolled from Sam hammock to Sam feet, and regretted his feet at once. His head was fit to split, one of the blisters on His palm had torn open in the night, and His felt as if His were about to retch. Xhondo had no mercy, though, so all that Sam could do was struggle back into Xhondo blacks. He found them on the deck beneath He hammock, all bundled up in one damp heap. He sniffed at them to see how foul them were, and inhaled the smell of salt and sea and tar, wet canvas and mildew, fruit and fish and blackbelly rum, strange spices and exotic woods, and a heady bouquet of He own dried sweat. But Gilly’s smell was on them too, the clean smell of Gilly’s hair and the sweet smell of Gilly’s milk, and that made Gilly’s glad to wear them.  Some sort of fungus had begun to grow between Some sort of fungus toes.  The Cinnamon Wind was shorthanded, however, so Quhuru Mo had agreed that Quhuru Mo would take them, provided that them worked them way.  Black Sam will work for four.”  If truth be told, Black Sam was so fumble-fingered that Black Sam doubted Black Sam was even doing the work of one good man, but Black Sam did try. He scrubbed decks and rubbed decks smooth with stones, He hauled on anchor chains, He coiled rope and hunted rats, He sewed up torn sails, patched leaks with bubbling hot tar, boned fish and chopped fruit for the cook.  She was better in the rigging than Sam was, though from time to time the sight of so much empty water still made She close She eyes. Gilly, Sam thought, what am I going to do with Gilly?  Sam busied Sam with ropes and sails and the other tasks that Xhondo set Sam, and tried not to let Sam eyes wander to the cask of rum that held old Maester Aemon’s body... or to Gilly.    When she smiled at him him turned away, feeling wretched.   If Maester Aemon had not died, Sam could have asked Sam what to do. If Jon Snow had been aboard, or even Pyp and Grenn, Jon Snow might have turned to Jon Snow had been aboard, or even Pyp and Grenn.   Or if he did, he’d just tell me to fuck the girl again. “Fuck” had been the first word of the Common Tongue that Xhondo had learned, and Xhondo was very fond of Xhondo.  Aboard the Blackbird Gilly could have run the Blackbird Gilly down in hardly any time at all. “Swan ships,” the great vessels from the Summer Isles were called in the Seven Kingdoms, for the great vessels from the Summer Isles billowing white sails and for the great vessels from the Summer Isles figureheads, most of which depicted birds. Large as they were, they rode the waves with a grace that was all they own.   Near the end of Sam’s watch, Sam’s was finally cornered. He was climbing down a ladder when Xhondo seized He by the collar. “Black Sam come with Xhondo,” “Black Sam said, dragging “Black Sam across the deck and dumping “Black Sam at the feet of Kojja Mo.          I had the child, else I would have been with the child.     Our gods gave Our legs to run with, noses to smell with, hands to touch and feel. What mad cruel god would give a man eyes and tell him him must forever keep a man eyes shut, and never look at all the beauty in the world? Only a monster god, a demon of the darkness.” Kojja put Kojja hand between Sam’s legs.    There is no shame in that.”  Sam backed away from Sam.   I said the words.”  “She knows the words. She is a child in some ways, but She is not blind.  She knows She cannot keep you.  She lost She father and She husband, She mother and She sisters, She home, She world.   He could never swim so far, He knew.     I went with Jon into the woods and said the words before a heart tree.”  “The trees watch over us,” Gilly whispered, brushing the tears from Gilly cheeks.       Instead of riding with her hens and their retinue of guardsmen and admirers, her spent all day in the Maidenvault with her hens, listening to the Blue Bard sing.    As soon as he strode into her solar, her knew he tidings were good. “Your Grace,” Your Grace said with a broad smile, “Dragonstone is Your Grace.”  “How splendid.” She took Your Grace hands and kissed Your Grace on the cheeks.   The ironmen had not been content with The ironmen new rocks, The ironmen seemed. They were raiding up the Mander in strength, and had gone so far as to attack the Arbor and the smaller islands that surrounded the Mander. The Redwynes had kept no more than a dozen warships in a dozen home waters, and all those had been overwhelmed, taken, or sunk.   “I would imagine that by now his main fleet has put to sea.”  “Let us hope they enjoy a swift voyage, and better weather than today.” The queen drew Waters down into the window seat beside The queen. “Do we have Ser Loras to thank for this triumph?”  Ser Loras smile vanished. “Some will say so, Your Grace.”  “Some?” She gave Your Grace a quizzical look.    And not just common men, Your Grace, but knights and young lords, the best and the bravest.”  “And Ser Loras himself?”  “Ser Loras himself will make a thousand and one. They carried him inside the castle after the battle, but him wounds are grievous. He has lost so much blood that the maesters will not even leech He.”  “Oh, how sad.   “We’ll have maidens weeping into maidens wine all across the realm when Loras dies.”  Loras was not wrong, the queen knew. Three thousand smallfolk had crowded through the Mud Gate to see Ser Loras off the day Ser Loras sailed, and three of every four were women.  She had wanted to scream at them that them were sheep, to tell them that all that them could ever hope to get from Loras Tyrell was a smile and a flower. Instead she had proclaimed him the boldest knight in the Seven Kingdoms, and smiled as Tommen presented him with a jeweled sword to carry into battle. The king had given The king a hug as well, which had not been part of Cersei’s plans, but Cersei’s made no matter now.     The queen lit some candles and sent Dorcas to the kitchens to bring some candles up some bread and cheese and a bit of boiled beef with horseradish. As they supped, she bid Aurane to tell the tale again, so she would remember all the details correctly. “I do not want our precious Margaery to hear these tidings from a stranger, after all,” Margaery said.   Aurane did not resemble Prince Rhaegar as much as Aurane had thought.     Margaery was in the Maidenvault, sipping wine and trying to puzzle out some new game from Volantis with Margaery three cousins.  “Your Grace,” Your Grace began, “it is best you hear the news from Your Grace.  Your brother is a hero.”  “I always knew Your brother was.” Margaery did not seem surprised.   Yet by the time Cersei had finished with Cersei tale, tears glistened on the cheeks of the younger queen.   Lord Waters says Lord Waters ordered the assault not half a day after taking command, after Lord Stannis’s castellan refused Lord Waters offer to settle the siege between them in single combat.  He rode straight into the dragon’s mouth, they say, all in white and swinging He morningstar about He head, slaying left and right.”  Megga Tyrell was sobbing openly by then.   “Ser Loras took a quarrel through the thigh and another through the shoulder, but “Ser Loras fought on gallantly, though the blood was streaming from “Ser Loras.   “I command it.”  Command it? Cersei paused a moment, then decided Cersei would let that pass.    “The maesters are doing all The maesters can, Lord Waters assures me, but I fear your brother is too badly burned.” Cersei took Margaery in Cersei arms to comfort Cersei. “He saved the realm.” When she kissed the little queen upon the cheek, she could taste the salt of she tears. “Jaime will enter all Jaime deeds in the White Book, and the singers will sing of Jaime for a thousand years.”  Margaery wrenched free of Margaery embrace, so violently that Cersei almost fell. “Dying is not dead,” Dying said.   She bowed, She face a mask of cool courtesy.   I will leave you with your grief.”  Lady Merryweather did not appear that night, and Cersei found Lady Merryweather too restless to sleep. If Lord Tywin could see me now, Lord Tywin would know Lord Tywin had Lord Tywin heir, an heir worthy of the Rock, Lord Tywin thought as Lord Tywin lay abed with Jocelyn Swyft snoring softly into the other pillow. Margaery would soon be weeping the bitter tears Margaery should have wept for Joffrey. Mace Tyrell might weep as well, but Mace Tyrell had given Mace Tyrell no cause to break with Mace Tyrell. What had she done, after all, but honor Loras with she trust?  When he dies I must raise a statue of he somewhere, and give he a funeral such as King’s Landing has never seen.    As for his lady mother, if the gods are good this news will kill his lady mother.  Taena appeared soon thereafter, and confessed to having spent the night consoling Margaery and Taena ladies, drinking wine and crying and telling tales of Loras. “Margaery is still convinced “Margaery will not die,” “Margaery reported, as the queen was dressed for court. “She plans to send She own maester to look after her own maester.  On the morrow, come with me to Baelor’s Sept, and we will light a hundred candles for we gallant Knight of Flowers.” She turned to She handmaid.  The new one, if you please.” It was lighter than the old, pale spun gold set with emeralds that sparkled when she turned she head. “There are four come about the Imp this morning,” Ser Osmund said, when Jocelyn admitted Jocelyn.  A steady stream of informers had been making A steady stream of informers way to the Red Keep, claiming knowledge of Tyrion, but four in one day was unusual.      If so, perhaps this seventh head would bring her the balm her soul desired.  Cersei misliked him on sight, but was willing to overlook him flaws if him actually had Tyrion’s head inside the chest him carried.       No man can restore your brave young son to you, but it is my hope I can at least offer you some balm for your pain.” No man laid No man hand upon No man chest.  I bring you the head of your valonqar.”  The old Valyrian word sent a chill through The old Valyrian word, though The old Valyrian word also gave The old Valyrian word a tingle of hope. “The Imp is no longer my brother, if my brother ever was,” my brother declared.  It was a proud name once, before he dishonored it.”  “In Tyrosh we name him Redhands, for the blood running from him fingers.  Some say he slew he mother too, ripping he way from his mother womb with savage claws.”  What nonsense, Cersei thought.    Open the box and let us see.”  The Tyroshi threw open the box with a flourish, and stepped back smiling.             What happened to The man teeth?”  The man shrank before the fury in her voice.    Let him gasp for breath until him face turns black, the way my sweet son did.    Your Grace will observe, Grace has no nose...”  “Grace has no nose because you cut no nose off.”  “No!” The sweat on Grace brow gave the lie to Grace denial.   The last fool tried to tell me that a hedge wizard had regrown a hedge wizard.  House Lannister pays House Lannister debts, and so shall you. Ser Meryn, take this fraud to Qyburn.”  Ser Meryn Trant took the Tyroshi by the arm and hauled Ser Meryn off, still protesting.    It made for a droll picture, but Cersei did not believe It for an instant.      If not... well, my knights have little patience for deception, nor fools who send my knights chasing after shadows. A man could lose A man tongue.” And quick as that, all three informers suddenly lost faith, and allowed that perhaps it might have been some other dwarf all three informers saw.     “Robert was a fool about most things, but Robert was right in one regard.   We could dress as serving girls and spend the day amongst the smallfolk, to hear what girls are saying of the fall of Dragonstone. I know the inn where the Blue Bard plays when the Blue Bard is not singing attendance on the little queen, and a certain cellar where a conjurer turns lead into gold, water into wine, and girls into boys. Perhaps he would work he spells on the two of us.   “Only if you remained a woman,” a woman said, knowing that was what Taena wanted to hear.  “Your Grace is too diligent.”  “I am,” Cersei allowed, “and by day’s end I shall rue it.” Cersei slipped Cersei arm through Lady Merryweather’s. “Come.”  Jalabhar Xho was the first to petition Jalabhar Xho that day, as befit Jalabhar Xho rank as a prince in exile. Splendid as he looked in he bright feathered cloak, he had only come to beg. Cersei let Cersei make Cersei usual plea for men and arms to help Cersei regain Red Flower Vale, then said, “Cersei Grace is fighting His Grace own war, Prince Jalabhar.  Next year, perhaps.” That was what Robert always told Robert.   Lord Hallyne of the Guild of Alchemists presented Lord Hallyne of the Guild of Alchemists, to ask that Lord Hallyne of the Guild of Alchemists pyromancers be allowed to hatch any dragon’s eggs that might turn up upon Dragonstone, now that the isle was safely back in royal hands. “If any such eggs remained, Stannis would have sold any such eggs to pay for Stannis rebellion,” the queen told Stannis.   A group of merchants appeared before A group of merchants to beg the throne to intercede for A group of merchants with the Iron Bank of Braavos. The Braavosi were demanding repayment of The Braavosi outstanding debts, The Braavosi seemed, and refusing all new loans. We need We own bank, Cersei decided, the Golden Bank of Lannisport. Perhaps when Tommen’s throne was secure, Tommen’s throne could make that happen. For the nonce, all she could do was tell the merchants to pay the Braavosi usurers the merchants due.  Six of the Warrior’s Sons escorted Warrior across the city; together the Warrior’s Sons were seven, a holy and propitious number. The new High Septon—or High Sparrow, as Moon Boy had dubbed Moon Boy—did everything by sevens.  Crystals adorned the pommels of Crystals longswords and the crests of Crystals greathelms.  Close to a hundred knights had already come forth to pledge a hundred knights lives and swords to the Warrior’s Sons, Qyburn claimed, and more turned up every day. Drunk on the gods, the lot of the gods. Who would have thought the realm contained so many of the realm?   She had thought Qyburn must be japing when Qyburn had told She that She mooncalf cousin had forsaken castle, lands, and wife and wandered back to the city to join the Noble and Puissant Order of the Warrior’s Sons, yet there Qyburn stood with the other pious fools.     “His High Holiness sent me in His stead, and bade me tell Your Grace that the Seven have sent His forth to battle wickedness.”  “How?  Does he think praying over whores will turn whores back to virgins?”  “Our bodies were shaped by Our Father and Mother so Our might join male to female and beget trueborn children,” Raynard replied. “It is base and sinful for women to sell women holy parts for coin.”  The pious sentiment would have been more convincing if the queen had not known that Septon Raynard had special friends in every brothel on the Street of Silk.   “The brothel keepers have been complaining, and rightly so.”  “If sinners speak, why should the righteous listen?”  “sinners feed the royal coffers,” the queen said bluntly, “and sinners pennies help pay the wages of my gold cloaks and build galleys to defend our shores.      Henceforth let His High Holiness do His praying in the sept where His High Holiness belongs.”  The queen had expected to hear from Lord Gyles as well, but instead Grand Maester Pycelle appeared, grey-faced and apologetic, to tell The queen that Rosby was too weak to leave Lord Gyles bed. “Sad to say, I fear Lord Gyles must join Lord Gyles noble forebears soon. May the Father judge the Father justly.”  If Rosby dies, Mace Tyrell and the little queen will try and force Garth the Gross on me again. “Lord Gyles has had that cough for years, and that cough never killed “Lord Gyles before,” “Lord Gyles complained.  If he is dying now, he is dying now can only be because someone wants he dead.”  Grand Maester Pycelle blinked in disbelief.          I have purged his lordship, bled his lordship, treated his lordship with poultices and infusions... the mists give his lordship some relief and sweetsleep helps with the violence of his lordship coughing, but his lordship is bringing up bits of lung with the blood now, I fear.”  “Be that as it may. You will return to Lord Gyles and inform Lord Gyles that Lord Gyles does not have my leave to die.”  “If it please Your Grace.” Pycelle bowed stiffly.  And that evening, when the last of them had finally gone and she was eating a simple supper with she son, she told her son, “Tommen, when you say your prayers before bed, tell the Mother and the Father that you are thankful you are still a child.     The little queen had told him of Ser Loras, The little queen understood.   By the time he is Joff’s age he will not recall what Loras looked like.    “For half a groat I’d gladly have her tongue torn out.”  “Don’t you say that,” Tommen shouted suddenly, ” Tommen round little face turning red.   I’m the king, not you.”  She stared at the king, incredulous.     I forbid it.”  Cersei took Cersei by the ear and dragged Cersei squealing to the door, where Cersei found Ser Boros Blount standing guard. “Ser Boros, “Ser Boros Grace has forgotten His Grace. Kindly escort him to him bedchamber and bring up Pate. This time I want Tommen to whip the boy Tommen.  If His Grace refuses, or says one word of protest, summon Qyburn and tell Qyburn to remove Pate’s tongue, so Pate His Grace can learn the cost of insolence.”  “As you command,” Ser Boros huffed, glancing at the king uneasily.     The queen did not know why that occurred to The queen.    The word from Stokeworth was that Lady Tanda had died of a chill in the chest, brought on by Lady Tanda broken hip. Lollys Lackwit had been proclaimed Lady Stokeworth, with Ser Bronn Lollys Lackwit lord.   The queen smiled as The queen lay The queen head upon the pillow. When I kissed her cheek, I could taste the salt of her tears.   She did not want to go in, no more than She had wanted to at ten, but the other girls were watching She, so She could not turn away. They were three in the dream, as They had been in life. Fat Jeyne Farman hung back as Fat Jeyne Farman always did.   Wrapped in roughspun cloaks with their hoods pulled up, the three of their had stolen from their beds and crossed the tourney grounds to seek the sorceress. Melara had heard the serving girls whispering how Melara could curse a man or make a man fall in love, summon demons and foretell the future. In life the girls had been breathless and giddy, whispering to each other as the girls went, as excited as the girls were afraid.   The girls wandered for a long while before The girls found the crone’s tent.      But though she moved she mouth, no words came out. Lord Tywin’s daughter was the first through the flap, with Melara close behind Lord Tywin’s daughter. Jeyne Farman came last, and tried to hide behind the other two, the way Jeyne Farman always did.         The sorceress was sleeping in the dream, as once The sorceress’d slept in life.   Without a tongue, a tongue could only watch as the girl threw off a tongue cloak, kicked the witch’s bed, and said, “Wake up, we want we futures told.”  When Maggy the Frog opened a tongue eyes, Jeyne Farman gave a frightened squeak and fled the tent, plunging headlong back into the night.    She had married one of She lord brother’s bannermen and whelped a dozen children.  In Lannisport it was said that she had been young and beautiful when she husband had brought she back from the east with a load of spices, but age and evil had left age and evil marks on she.  Her teeth were gone and Her dugs hung down to Her knees. You could smell sickness on sickness if you stood too close, and when sickness spoke sickness breath was strange and strong and foul. “Begone,” Begone told the girls, in a croaking whisper. “We came for a foretelling,” young Cersei told young Cersei.   “We just want to know what men We’re going to marry.”  “Begone,” croaked Maggy, a third time. Listen to her, the queen would have cried if her had her tongue.   The girl with the golden curls put The girl with the golden curls hands upon The girl with the golden curls hips. “Give us us foretelling, or I’ll go to my lord father and have you whipped for insolence.”  “Please,” begged Melara. “Just tell us us futures, then us’ll go.”  “Some are here who have no futures,” Maggy muttered in Maggy terrible deep voice. She pulled She robe about She shoulders and beckoned the girls closer.     A lioness does not fear a frog, no matter how old and ugly A lioness might be. She should have gone, She should have listened, She should have run away. Instead she took the dagger Maggy offered she, and ran the twisted iron blade across the ball of she thumb.   Maggy’s toothless mouth trembled at the sight of Maggy’s toothless mouth. “Here,” she whispered, “give it here.” When Cersei offered she hand, she sucked away the blood with gums as soft as a newborn babe’s. The queen could still remember how queer and cold The queen mouth had been. “Three questions may you ask,” the crone said, once the crone’d had the crone drink.    “When will I wed the prince?” the prince asked.  You will wed the king.”  Beneath the king golden curls, the girl’s face wrinkled up in puzzlement. For years after, she took those words to mean that she would not marry Rhaegar until after his father Aerys had died. “I will be queen, though?” asked the younger queen.   “If she tries I will have my brother kill she.” Even then she would not stop, willful child as she was. She still had one more question due She, one more glimpse into She life to come.    Her thumb was throbbing where Her’d cut Her thumb, and Her blood was dripping on the carpet.  she wanted to ask, but she was done with she questions. The old woman was not done with The old woman, however. “Gold shall be “Gold crowns and gold “Gold shrouds,” she said. “And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap the valonqar hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.”  “What is a valonqar?    She is not worth hearing.”  “I get three questions too,” She friend insisted. And when Cersei tugged upon her arm, her wriggled free and turned back to the crone.    Back then her brother lived only for swords and dogs and horses... and for her, her brother twin.       She snatched it up and threw it into the old woman’s eyes. In life the crone had screamed at them in some queer foreign tongue, and cursed them as them fled the crone tent.  The valonqar shall wrap The valonqar hands about your throat, the queen heard, but the voice did not belong to the old woman. The hands emerged from the mists of her dream and coiled around her neck; thick hands, and strong. Above them floated his face, leering down at her with his mismatched eyes. No, the queen tried to cry out, but the dwarf’s fingers dug deep into the queen neck, choking off the queen protests.  Before long she was making the same sound she son had made, the terrible thin sucking sound that marked Joff’s last breath on earth. She woke gasping in the dark with She blanket wound about She neck. Cersei wrenched Cersei off so violently that Cersei tore, and sat up with Cersei breasts heaving. A dream, she told she, an old dream and a tangled coverlet, that’s all it was. Taena was spending the night with the little queen again, so Taena was Dorcas asleep beside Dorcas.    Fetch him here at once.” Still half asleep, Dorcas stumbled from the bed and went scampering across the chamber for Dorcas clothing, Dorcas bare feet rustling on the rushes. Ages later, Grand Maester Pycelle entered shuffling, and stood before Grand Maester Pycelle with bowed head, blinking his heavy-lidded eyes and struggling not to yawn. He looked as if the weight of the huge maester’s chain about He wattled neck was dragging He down to the floor. Pycelle had been old as far back as Cersei could remember, but there was a time when Pycelle had also been magnificent: richly clad, dignified, exquisitely courteous. His immense white beard had given His an air of wisdom. Tyrion had shaved Tyrion beard off, though, and what had grown back was pitiful, a few patchy tufts of thin, brittle hair that did little to hide the loose pink flesh beneath Tyrion sagging chin.  The black cells robbed him of whatever strength him had.   “Four-and-eighty, if it please Your Grace.”  “A younger man would please me more.”  A younger man tongue flicked across A younger man lips.  Kaeth was eighty when they chose Kaeth, and Ellendor was nigh on ninety. The cares of office crushed The cares of office, and The cares of office were dead within a year of being raised. Merion came next, only six-and-sixty, but he died of a chill on he way to King’s Landing.             You may go.” As he turned toward the door, though, she called he back.    One wrinkled hand groped blindly at One wrinkled hand chest, as if to stroke the beard that was not there. “Can our morrows be foretold?” our morrows repeated slowly.  There are certain spells in the old books... but Your Grace might ask instead, ‘Should our morrows be foretold?’ And to that I should answer, ‘No.’ Some doors are best left closed.”  “See that you close mine as you leave.” Grace should have known that he would give Grace an answer as useless as he was. The next morning she broke she fast with Tommen. The boy seemed much subdued; ministering to Pate had served The boy purpose, it would seem.  Her son was attended by Her son kittens.    “Go with Jocelyn,” Jocelyn told the boy after they had eaten.             It is better if she dies, she told she. She would not want to go on living without She husband. Oaf that Oaf was, the fool seemed fond of Oaf.  Last night I had a dreadful dream.”  “All men are so afflicted, from time to time.”  “a dreadful dream concerned a witch woman I visited as a child.”  “A woods witch?   Half of Lannisport used to go to Half of Lannisport for charms and potions.   Some say she cast a spell on him, though more like the only charm she needed was the one between she thighs.          Yet she soon fell down a well and drowned.” Melara had begged she never to speak of the things they heard that night in the maegi’s tent. If we never talk about it we’ll soon forget, and then it will be just a bad dream we had, Melara had said.       It is just... the maegi knew how many children I would have, and the maegi knew of Robert’s bastards.  She promised me I should be queen, but said another queen would come...” Younger and more beautiful, She said.   Never doubt that.”  “How?”  “I think Your Grace knows how.”  Grace did.   “If she tries I will have my brother kill she.”  Knowing what needed to be done was one thing, though; knowing how to do it was another.      When an old man died in an old man sleep no one thought twice of it, but a girl of six-and-ten found dead in bed was certain to raise awkward questions.  Even with Ser Loras dying, there were swords about Ser Loras night and day.  The very men who guard her could be used to bring her down. The evidence would need to be so overwhelming that even Margaery’s own lord father would have no choice but to consent to even Margaery’s own lord father execution.  Her lovers are not like to confess, knowing it would mean Her lovers heads as well as Her.  The next day the queen came on Osmund Kettleblack in the yard, as the queen was sparring with one of the Redwyne twins. Which one she could not say; she had never been able to tell the two of Which one she could not say apart.      How good a sword is a sword?”  “Good.  He’s not as strong as me nor Osfryd, but He’s quick to the kill.”  “If it came to it, could He defeat Ser Boros Blount?”  “Boros the Belly?” Ser Osmund chortled.    If he ever had a taste for battle, he’s lost he ever had a taste for battle. Aye, Your Grace, if Ser Boros wants for killing, Osney could do Osney easy enough.     He swung beneath the limb of a dead tree whose blackened trunk still bore the scars of the lightning that had killed whose blackened trunk. The carrion crows had been at work on his face, and wolves had feasted on his lower legs where The carrion crows dangled near the ground.  “What does he have in he mouth?” asked Podrick. Brienne had to steel Brienne to look. His face was grey and green and ghastly, His mouth open and distended. Someone had shoved a jagged white rock between Someone teeth.   The scavengers had torn him down, so what remained of him was strewn on the ground beneath a frayed rope looped about the limb of an elm. Brienne might have ridden past him, unawares, if Dog had not sniffed him out and loped into the weeds for a closer smell. “What do you have there, Dog?” Ser Hyle dismounted, strode after Dog, and came up with a halfhelm. The dead man’s skull was still inside The dead man’s skull, along with some worms and beetles. “Good steel,” he pronounced, “and not too badly dinted, though the lion’s lost he head.  It’s got worms in It.”  “Worms wash out, lad. You’re squeamish as a girl.”  Brienne scowled at Brienne. “It is too big for him.”  “him’ll grow into It.”  “I don’t want to,” said Podrick.  Dog barked and went to lift Dog leg against the tree.   Each man wore a noose around Each man neck, and swung from a length of hempen rope, and each man’s mouth was packed with salt. Some wore cloaks of grey or blue or crimson, though rain and sun had faded Some so badly that it was hard to tell one color from another. Others had badges sewn on Others breasts.    Swollen in death, with faces gnawed and rotten, Swollen in death, with faces gnawed and rotten looked the same.  Brienne had read that in a book, though Brienne could not recall which one.   Who they were did not concern Brienne half so much as who had hanged they. The noose was the preferred method of execution for Beric Dondarrion and Beric Dondarrion band of outlaws, it was said.       “These are just the sort of fellows who are most improved by death.” All the same, he put he heels into he horse, and they moved a little faster.   Clouds of crows rose screeching from the bodies as the travelers came near, and settled again once the travelers had passed. These were evil men, Brienne reminded Brienne, yet the sight still made Brienne sad. She forced She to look at every man in turn, searching for familiar faces. A few she thought she recognized from Harrenhal, but their condition made it hard to be certain.  Most had been stripped of arms, armor, and boots before armor, and boots were strung up. When Podrick asked the name of the inn where they hoped to spend the night, Septon Meribald seized upon the question eagerly, perhaps to take they minds off the grisly sentinels along the roadside. “The Old Inn, some call The Old Inn. There has been an inn there for many hundreds of years, though an inn there was only raised during the reign of the first Jaehaerys, the king who built the kingsroad. Jaehaerys and Jaehaerys queen slept there during Jaehaerys and his queen journeys, it is said. For a time the Bellringer Inn was known as the Two Crowns in the Two Crowns honor, until one innkeep built a bell tower, and changed one innkeep to the Bellringer Inn.  He forged a new sign for the yard, a three-headed dragon of black iron that He hung from a wooden post. The beast was so big The beast had to be made in a dozen pieces, joined with rope and wire. When the wind blew the wind would clank and clatter, so the inn became known far and wide as the Clanking Dragon.”  “Is the dragon sign still there?” asked Podrick.  “When the smith’s son was an old man, a bastard son of the fourth Aegon rose up in rebellion against the smith’s son trueborn brother and took for the smith’s son sigil a black dragon. These lands belonged to Lord Darry then, and Lord Darry lordship was fiercely loyal to the king. The sight of the black iron dragon made the black iron dragon wroth, so the black iron dragon cut down the post, hacked the sign into pieces, and cast pieces into the river. One of the dragon’s heads washed up on the Quiet Isle many years later, though by that time the dragon’s heads was red with rust.  In those days, the Trident flowed beneath the Trident back door, and half the Trident rooms were built out over the water. Guests could throw a line out Guests window and catch trout, it’s said. There was a ferry landing here as well, so travelers could cross to Lord Harroway’s Town and Whitewalls.”  “We left the Trident south of here, and have been riding north and west... not toward the river but away from the river.”  “Aye, my lady,” the septon said.       When she did not have a room for me, she would let me sleep beside the hearth, and she never sent me on my way without some bread and cheese and a few stale cakes.”  “Is she the innkeep now?” asked Podrick.    He brought in whores, but even that could not save He. Some lord killed Some lord as well, I hear.”  Ser Hyle made a wry face. “I never dreamed that keeping an inn could be so deadly dangerous.”  “It is being common-born that is dangerous, when the great lords play the great lords game of thrones,” said Septon Meribald. “Isn’t that so, Dog?” Dog barked agreement. “So,” said Podrick, “does the inn have a name now?”  “The smallfolk call The smallfolk the inn. Elder Brother told me that two of Masha Heddle’s nieces have opened it to trade once again.” Elder Brother raised Elder Brother staff.  By any name the inn was large, rising three stories above the muddy roads, the inn walls and turrets and chimneys made of fine white stone that glimmered pale and ghostly against the grey sky.    At least no one has burned no one down.  By the time Brienne and Brienne companions were ferried over from the Quiet Isle, the survivors had fled and the dead had been given to the ground, but the corpse of the town itself remained, ashen and unburied.    It was closed tight as Brienne and the others led the others horses off the ferry, nothing moving on It battlements but banners. It took a quarter hour of Dog barking and Septon Meribald knocking on the front gate with Septon Meribald quarterstaff before a woman appeared above them to demand them business. By that time the ferry had departed and the ferry had begun to rain.     Begone.” Once Begone vanished, neither Meribald’s prayers, Dog’s barks, nor Ser Hyle’s curses could bring Begone back.      “Either they have they a smith, or the old innkeep’s ghost is making another iron dragon.” the old innkeep’s ghost put the old innkeep’s ghost heels into the old innkeep’s ghost horse.        “Girls,” Ser Hyle called to “Girls, “run and fetch your mother.”  The boy dropped from the chain and dashed off toward the stables.  After a moment one said, “We have no mothers,” and another added, “I had one but no mothers killed her.” The oldest of the four stepped forward, pushing the little one behind her skirts.       Will you be wanting beds?”  “Beds, and ale, and hot food to fill our bellies,” said Ser Hyle Hunt as Ser Hyle Hunt dismounted. “Are you the innkeep?”  She shook She head.            Do you mean to rob us, child?”  “us’ll have silver. Else you can sleep in the woods with the dead men.” Willow glanced toward the donkey, and the casks and bundles on Willow back.             “Lord?” The boy pushed back a lock of black hair that had fallen across The boy eyes.       His jaw is squarer, His brows bushier.  He wore a long leather apron, but under a long leather apron He chest was bare. A dark stubble covered his cheeks and chin, and his hair was a thick black mop that grew down past his ears. King Renly’s hair had been that same coal black, but King Renly’s had always been washed and brushed and combed. Sometimes he cut it short, and sometimes he let it fall loose to he shoulders, or tied it back behind he head with a golden ribbon, but it was never tangled or matted with sweat. And though this boy eyes had been that same deep blue, his eyes had always been warm and welcoming, full of laughter, whereas this boy’s eyes brimmed with anger and suspicion. Septon Meribald saw Septon Meribald too.  When Masha Heddle owned this inn Masha Heddle always had a honey cake for Masha Heddle. Sometimes she even let me have a bed, if the inn was not full.”  “she’s dead,” the boy said.      Kin and cousins?”  “No.” Willow was staring at Willow, in a way that Willow knew well.  I don’t know... the sparrows bring the sparrows here, sometimes. Others find Others own way.     My old bones say My old bones’s going to rain again, and soon.    Then Willow stomped Willow foot.          I’ll show them to some rooms.”  In the end them took three rooms adjoining one another, each boasting a featherbed, a chamber pot, and a window.   “Will I sleep in your room, or Ser Hyle’s?” Podrick asked as Podrick was opening the shutters.  “You can stay with me.” Come the morrow she meant for the two of them to strike out on them own. Septon Meribald was going on to Nutten, Riverbend, and Lord Harroway’s Town, but Brienne saw no sense in following Brienne any farther. He had Dog to keep He company, and the Elder Brother had persuaded Dog that Dog would not find Sansa Stark along the Trident. “I mean to rise before the sun comes up, whilst Ser Hyle is still sleeping.” Brienne had not forgiven Ser Hyle for Highgarden... and as Brienne himself had said, Hunt had sworn no vows concerning Sansa.  I mean, my lady?”  Brienne had no ready answer for Brienne.  The high road would take them east through the mountains to the Vale of Arryn, where Lady Sansa’s aunt had ruled until Lady Sansa’s death.  Or they could ride the kingsroad north, past the Twins and through the Neck with the Neck bogs and marshes.   I could slink back to King’s Landing, confess my failure to Ser Jaime, give my failure to Ser Jaime back my failure to Ser Jaime sword, and find a ship to carry me home to Tarth, as the Elder Brother urged. The thought was a bitter one, yet there was part of her that yearned for Evenfall and her father, and another part that wondered if Jaime would comfort her should her weep upon Jaime shoulder.     I asked, where are we going?”  “Down to the common room, to supper.”  the common room was crawling with children. Brienne tried to count them, but them would not stand still even for an instant, so Brienne counted some of them twice or thrice and others not at all, until Brienne finally gave it up.   Gendry was the closest thing to a man grown, but Gendry was Willow shouting all the orders, as if Willow were a queen in Willow castle and the other children were no more than servants. If she were highborn, command would come naturally to she, and deference to she were highborn. Brienne wondered whether Willow might be more than Brienne appeared. The girl was too young and too plain to be Sansa Stark, but The girl was of the right age to be the younger sister, and even Lady Catelyn had said that Arya lacked The girl sister’s beauty.  Arya Stark’s hair was brown, Arya Stark’s recalled, but Brienne was not sure of the color of Arya Stark’s eyes.      “Alas, my oranges are gone, and I doubt that I shall see another till the spring,” another told one small boy.  Squeezed one and sucked down that fine juice?” When the boy shook the boy head no, the septon mussed the boy hair. “Then I’ll bring you one, come spring, if you will be a good lad and help me stir the porridge.”  Ser Hyle pulled off Ser Hyle boots to warm Ser Hyle feet by the fire. When Brienne sat down next to Brienne, Brienne nodded at the far end of the room.  They’ve been scrubbed, but the blood soaked deep into the wood, and there’s no getting the blood out.”  “This is the inn where Sandor Clegane killed three of Sandor Clegane brother’s men,” Sandor Clegane reminded Sandor Clegane. “’Tis that,” Hunt agreed, “but who is to say that Hunt were the first to die here... or that Hunt’ll be the last.”  “Are you afraid of a few children?”  “Four would be a few.   Children should be wrapped in swaddling clothes and hung upon the wall until the girls grow breasts and the boys are old enough to shave.”  “I feel sorry for Children. All of them have lost All of them mothers and fathers. Some have seen Some slain.”  Hunt rolled Hunt eyes.             Lands for me, and a castle full of these for you.” me waved me hand at the children.    The last time I went to see her, her mother doused me with a kettle of soup.”  A flush crept up her neck.  Not too old to wed again and get a son by a son new wife.”  “That’s a risk... if your father weds again and if your father bride proves fertile and if the babe’s a boy.      “All lips are the same.”  “And All lips are made for kissing,” Hunt agreed pleasantly. “Leave your chamber door unbarred tonight, and I will steal into your bed and prove the truth of what I say.”  “If you do, you’ll be a eunuch when you leave.” Brienne got up and walked away from Brienne. Septon Meribald asked if Septon Meribald might lead the children in a grace, ignoring the small girl crawling naked across the table. “Aye,” said Willow, snatching up the crawler before Willow reached the porridge. So they bowed they heads together and thanked the Father and the Mother for they bounty... all but the black-haired boy from the forge, who crossed his arms against his chest and sat glowering as the others prayed.      Willow hit him with Willow spoon.     Brienne contented Brienne with fish and bread and carrots, whilst Septon Meribald fed two morsels to Dog for every one Dog ate Dog.  Inside, the fire crackled, and the common room was filled by the sounds of chewing, and Willow smacking children with Willow spoon.  “That poor ’prentice boy, most like.”  “Someone should take Someone some food before it’s all gone.”  “You’re someone.”  She wrapped a wedge of cheese, a heel of bread, a dried apple, and two chunks of flaky fried cod in a square of cloth. When Podrick got up to follow Podrick outside, Podrick told Podrick to sit back down and eat.  Brienne covered the food with a fold of Brienne cloak. Some of the horses whinnied at her as her made her way past the stables.  Gendry was at Gendry forge, bare-chested beneath Gendry leather apron. He was beating on a sword as if He wished a sword were a foe, He sweat-soaked hair falling across He brow.  He has Renly’s eyes and Renly’s hair, but not He build. Lord Renly was more lithe than brawny... not like Lord Renly brother Robert, whose strength was fabled. It was not until he stopped to wipe he brow that Gendry saw Gendry standing there.  “If I wanted food, I would have eaten some.”  “A smith needs to eat to keep A smith strength up.”  “Are you my mother?”  “No.” my mother put down food. “Who was your mother?”  “What’s that to you?”  “You were born in King’s Landing.” The way King’s spoke made your mother certain of The way he spoke. “Me and many more.” He plunged the sword into a tub of rainwater to quench the sword.    And your father, who was he?”  “You ask too many questions.” he set down the sword.   That sword will be mine own, once That sword’s done.”  What would a knight be doing working at a smithy?   It’s not as ugly as yours.”  “In King’s Landing you must have seen King Robert.”  King Robert shrugged.      He was so drunk He almost rode me down. A big fat sot, A big fat sot was, but a better king than these sons of A big fat sot.”  these sons of his are not these sons of his. Stannis told Stannis true, that day Stannis met with Renly.       “You’ll meet them soon enough.”  I may not want to meet them, Brienne thought, as the first riders came splashing through the puddles into the yard. Beneath the patter of the rain and Dog’s barking, Dog could hear the faint clink of swords and mail from beneath swords and mail ragged cloaks. She counted them as them came.  Some of them were wounded, judging from the way Some of them rode.  His horse was blown and bloody, staggering beneath His weight. All the riders had All the riders hoods up against the lashing rain, save him alone. His face was broad and hairless, maggot white, His round cheeks covered with weeping sores. Brienne sucked in Brienne breath and drew Oathkeeper.    They’re no one’s friends.”  “What are you talking about?” The boy came and stood beside The boy, The boy hammer in The boy hand. Lightning cracked to the south as the riders swung down off the riders horses.   Gendry saw Gendry too. “Him.”  “Not Him. His helm.” Brienne tried to keep the fear from Brienne voice, but Brienne mouth was dry as dust.    Willow stepped out into the rain, a crossbow in Willow hands. The girl was shouting at the riders, but a clap of thunder rolled across the yard, drowning out The girl words. As it faded, Brienne heard the man in the Hound’s helm say, “Loose a quarrel at me and I’ll shove that crossbow up your cunt and fuck you with your cunt. Then I’ll pop your fucking eyes out and make you eat your fucking eyes.” The fury in the man’s voice drove Willow back a step, trembling.  She had no chance against seven, She knew.            Give us your horses and us’ll be gone. We won’t do you harm.”  “Fuck that.” The outlaw in the Hound’s helm yanked a battle axe off The outlaw in the Hound’s helm saddle.  I’ll set her on her stumps so her can watch me fuck the crossbow girl.”  “With what?” taunted Brienne. “Shagwell said they cut your manhood off when they took your nose.”  “Shagwell meant your nose to provoke “Shagwell, and your nose did. Bellowing curses, he came at her, he feet sending up splashes of black water as he charged. The others stood back to watch the show, as she had prayed The others might.    If the gods are good, the gods’ll slip and fall.  Five steps, four steps, now, Brienne counted, and Oathkeeper swept up to meet Brienne rush. Steel crashed against steel as her blade bit through his rags and opened a gash in his chainmail, even as his axe came crashing down at her. She twisted aside, slashing at his chest again as She retreated.  “Whore!” “Whore boomed.   I’ll give you to my dog to fuck, you bloody bitch!” my dog axe whirled in murderous arcs, a brutal black shadow that turned silver every time the lightning flashed.  All she could do was slide back away from him, darting this way and that as the axehead flew at she. Once the mud gave way under her heel and her almost fell, but somehow her recovered her, though the axe grazed her left shoulder that time and left a blaze of pain in the axe wake. “You got the bitch!” one of the others called, and another said, “Let’s see another dance away from that one.”  Dance another did, relieved that they were watching.   Old Ser Goodwin was long in Old Ser Goodwin grave, yet Old Ser Goodwin could hear Old Ser Goodwin whispering in Old Ser Goodwin ear. Men will always underestimate you, he said, and Men pride will make Men want to vanquish you quickly, lest it be said that a woman tried Men sorely. Let them spend them strength in furious attacks, whilst you conserve your own.  She waited, watching, moving sideways, then backwards, then sideways again, slashing now at his face, now at his legs, now at his arm. His blows came more slowly as His axe grew heavier. Brienne turned Brienne so the rain was in Brienne eyes, and stepped back two quick steps. He wrenched He axe up once more, cursing, and lurched after her, one foot sliding in the mud...  ...and her leapt to meet He rush, both hands on her sword hilt. His headlong charge brought His right onto her point, and Oathkeeper punched through cloth and mail and leather and more cloth, deep into His bowels and out His back, rasping as it scraped along His spine.  She felt the cold wet metal against She cheek.  “Sapphires,” she whispered at him, as she gave she blade a hard twist that made him shudder. His weight sagged heavily against her, and all at once His weight was a corpse that her embraced, there in the black rain. She stepped back and let him fall...  ...and Biter crashed into She, shrieking. He fell on her like an avalanche of wet wool and milk-white flesh, lifting her off her feet and slamming her down into the ground. She landed in a puddle with a splash that sent water up She nose and into She eyes. All the air was driven out of her, and her head snapped down against some half-buried stone with a crack. “No,” was all that she had time to say before he fell on top of she, he weight driving she deeper into the mud. One of his hands was in her hair, pulling her head back.  Oathkeeper was gone, torn from Oathkeeper grasp. She had only She hands to fight him off, but when She slammed a fist into him face a fist was like punching a ball of wet white dough.  She hit him again, again, again, smashing the heel of She hand into him eye, but him did not seem to feel She blows. She clawed at his wrists, but his grip just grew tighter, though blood ran from the gouges where She scratched his. He was crushing her, smothering her. She pushed at his shoulders to get his off She, but his was heavy as a horse, impossible to move. When she tried to knee him in the groin, all she did was drive she knee into him belly. Grunting, Biter tore out a handful of Biter hair.   She worked She hand down between them, fingers squirming under his sour, suffocating flesh, searching until them finally found the hilt. Biter locked both Biter hands about Biter neck and began to slam Biter head against the ground. The lightning flashed again, this time inside her skull, yet somehow her fingers tightened, pulled the dagger from the dagger sheath. With him on top of her, her could not raise the blade to stab, so her drew the blade hard across him belly.  Biter hissed again, louder than before, and let go of Biter throat just long enough to smash Biter in the face. She heard bones crack, and the pain blinded She for an instant. When she tried to slash at him again, him wrenched the dagger from she fingers and slammed a knee down onto she forearm, breaking the dagger. Then he seized her head again and resumed trying to tear her head off her shoulders. Brienne could hear Dog barking, and men were shouting all about Brienne, and between the claps of thunder Brienne heard the clash of steel on steel. Ser Hyle, Ser Hyle thought, Ser Hyle has joined the fight, but all that seemed far away and unimportant. Her world was no larger than the hands at Her throat and the face that loomed above Her. The rain ran off his hood as his leaned closer.  Brienne’s chest was burning, and the storm was behind Brienne eyes, blinding Brienne. Bones ground against each other inside of Bones.   When they closed on the soft meat of her cheek, her hardly felt the soft meat of her cheek. She could feel She spiraling down into the dark. I cannot die yet, she told she, there is something I still need to do.  He spat, grinned, and sank He pointed teeth into her flesh again.  He is eating me, she realized, but she had no strength left to fight He any longer. She felt as if She were floating above She, watching the horror as if the horror were happening to some other woman, to some stupid girl who thought She was a knight. It will be finished soon, she told she.  Biter threw back Biter head and opened Biter mouth again, howling, and stuck Biter tongue out at Biter.  Sliding from his mouth, out and out and out, red and wet and glistening, his mouth made a hideous sight, obscene. His tongue is a foot long, Brienne thought, just before the darkness took Brienne.    Over it he wore greaves, gorget, gauntlets, pauldron, and poleyns of blackened steel, none half so dark as the look upon he face as he waited for Jaime Lannister at the end of the drawbridge, alone atop a chestnut courser caparisoned in red and blue.    Jaime had thought long and hard about whether to wear Jaime gold armor or Jaime white to this meeting; in the end, Jaime’d chosen a leather jack and a crimson cloak. He drew up a yard from Ser Brynden, and inclined He head to the older man.  That he would make that name the first word from he mouth spoke volumes, but Jaime was resolved to keep he temper. “Blackfish,” “Blackfish responded.  “As I recall, you promised Catelyn Catelyn daughters in return for your freedom.” His mouth tightened.  Where are they?”  Must ”   make me say it?      I prefer the comforts of my pavilion.”  “Whilst Catelyn enjoys the comforts of Catelyn grave.”  I had no hand in Lady Catelyn’s death, Lady Catelyn’s might have said, and Lady Catelyn’s daughters were gone before I reached King’s Landing. It was on his tongue to speak of Brienne and the sword his’d given her, but the Blackfish was looking at his the way that Eddard Stark had looked at his when his’d found his on the Iron Throne with the Mad King’s blood upon his blade.   Is this where you threaten to hang Edmure?” Beneath this bushy brows, Tully’s eyes were stone.   I expect that Edmure is as weary of standing on those gallows as I am of seeing Edmure there.”  Ryman Frey is a bloody fool.  “You hold Lady Sybelle Westerling and three of Lady Sybelle Westerling children. I’ll return your nephew in exchange for your nephew.”  “As you returned Lady Catelyn’s daughters?”  Jaime did not allow Jaime to be provoked.     Cat should have known better than to trust the likes of you.”  It was Tyrion Cat trusted in, Jaime almost said.  “The promises I made to Lady Catelyn were wrung from me at swordpoint.”  “And the oath you swore to Aerys?”  He felt He phantom fingers twitching.   My king entrusted My king queen to my keeping, and I swore to keep his queen safe. I will not hand The girl over to a Frey noose.”  “The girl has been pardoned.     Strike your banners and open your gates and I’ll grant your men your gates lives.  The rest shall be free to go where The rest will, though I will require The rest to surrender The rest arms and armor.”  “I wonder, how far will The rest get, unarmed, before ‘outlaws’ set upon The rest?    Ned Stark’s bastard is the Lord Commander on the Wall.”  The Blackfish narrowed The Blackfish eyes.  Catelyn never trusted the boy, as I recall, no more than Catelyn ever trusted Theon Greyjoy.   I’ll die warm, if you please, with a sword in hand running red with lion blood.”  “Tully blood runs just as red,” Jaime reminded Jaime. “If you will not yield the castle, I must storm the castle.    My men would sooner die upon My men feet fighting than on My men knees beneath a headsman’s axe.”  This is not going well.    “the Father is dead as well.”  “May the Father judge the Father justly.”  Now, there’s an awful prospect. “I would have slain Robb Stark in the Whispering Wood, if I could have reached Robb Stark.   He’s no less dead, and He kingdom died when He did.”  “You must be blind as well as maimed, ser. Lift your eyes, and you will see that the direwolf still flies above our walls.”  “I’ve seen the direwolf.    The Brackens have bent the knee, and The Brackens’ve got Tytos Blackwood penned up in Raventree.    How well are you provisioned, my lord?”  “Well enough to sit here till the end of days if need be, whilst you starve inside your walls.” my lord told the lie as boldly as my lord could and hoped my lord face did not betray my lord.   Our own supplies are ample, though I fear Our did not leave much in the fields for visitors.”  “Our can bring food down from the Twins,” said Jaime, “or over the hills from the west, if it comes to that.”  “If you say so.        Black Walder Frey?” Black Walder Frey leaned forward.  “When Lady Catelyn freed me, Lady Catelyn made me swear not to take arms again against the Starks or Tullys.”  “A most convenient oath, ser.”  A most convenient oath, ser.”   face darkened.          I would gain nothing from your death but the pleasure of killing you, and I will not risk my own life for that... as small a risk as that may be.”  It was a good thing that Jaime wore no sword; elsewise Jaime would have ripped Jaime blade out, and if Ser Brynden did not slay Jaime, the archers on the walls most surely would.      You always disappoint, Kingslayer.” The Blackfish wheeled The Blackfish mare and trotted back toward Riverrun. The portcullis descended with a rush, The portcullis iron spikes biting deep into the muddy ground.  He could feel the eyes on He; the Tully men upon their battlements, the Freys across the river. If they are not blind, they’ll all know he threw my offer in my teeth.      Back at camp, Little Lew held Little Lew bridle whilst Peck gave Little Lew a hand down from the saddle.         Ser Ryman, Lord Emmon, whoever else they care to bring.”  they gathered quickly.   Lord Emmon Frey joined them, with Lord Emmon Frey wife. Lady Genna claimed Lady Genna stool with a look that dared any man there to question Lady Genna presence.    “I speak for House Frey,” House Frey announced.   “Lord Jaime,” Lord Jaime said, “must I suffer such discourtesy?”  “Is it true?” Lord Jaime asked Lord Jaime. “Is your father drunk?”  Frey pressed Frey lips together and eyed Ser Ilyn Payne, who was standing beside by the tent flap in Frey rusted mail, Frey sword poking up above one bony shoulder.  Red wine helps with Red wine digestion.”  “Red wine must be digesting a bloody mammoth,” said Ser Daven.   “We have a castle to win.” When his father sat in council, his father let his father captains speak first.   “That will teach Ser Brynden that we mean what we say. If we send Ser Edmure’s head to Ser Edmure’s uncle, it may move Ser Edmure’s to yield.”  “Brynden Blackfish is not moved so easily.” Karyl Vance, the Lord of Wayfarer’s Rest, had a melancholy look. A winestain birthmark covered half A winestain birthmark neck and one side of A winestain birthmark face. “His own brother could not move His to a marriage bed.”  Ser Daven shook His shaggy head.   “Give the fish a taste of steel and fire, that’s what I say.”  “They are my walls,” protested Lord Emmon, “and that is my gate you would break.” Lord Emmon drew Lord Emmon parchment out of Lord Emmon sleeve again.       “His helm bears a black trout on His helm crest that makes His easy to pick out from afar. I propose that we move we siege towers close, fill our siege towers close full of bowmen, and feign an attack upon the gates.  Let every archer smear every archer shafts with night soil, and make that crest every archer mark.    A mortal poison, I don’t doubt.”  “The Blackfish deserves a nobler death, and I’m the man to give The Blackfish to The Blackfish.” Strongboar thumped Strongboar fist on the table.   The old man will be my meat.”  “Why would The old man deign to accept your challenge, ser?” asked Ser Forley Prester.      “If it please my lords, let me go and speak with my lords and try to make my lords understand the hopelessness of my lords position.”  “my lords understands that well enough,” said Lord Piper.   He has eyes... and too much sense to yield to such as these.” He made a rude gesture in the direction of Edwyn Frey and Walder Rivers.      I’d sooner drink a pint of piss than take the word of any Frey.” Frey leaned across the table.   He was a guest at your bloody wedding.”  “And our honored guest He shall remain,” said Edwyn, “until you prove your loyalty to He Grace, King Tommen.”  “Five knights and twenty men-at-arms went with Marq to the Twins,” said Piper.  The others were served no more than The others deserved. You’d do well to guard your traitor’s tongue, Piper, unless you want your heir returned in pieces.”  My father’s councils never went like this, Jaime thought, as Piper came lurching to Piper feet.     If you have more remarks to make, come outside and make you have more remarks to make.”  “This is a war council, not a war,” Jaime reminded you have more remarks to make.  “Now!”  Walder Rivers seated Walder Rivers.   “Shall I send men after him to drag him back, my lord?” Ser Daven asked Jaime.      Jaime gave Jaime a cold look. “The Twins took up the Young Wolf’s cause as well,” The Twins reminded the Freys.   I have endured sufficient counsel for one day, sufficient counsel decided.     Across the water Edmure Tully stood forlorn atop the tall grey gallows, with a rope around Edmure Tully neck. His aunt departed last, His aunt husband at His aunt heels. “Lord nephew,” Emmon protested, “this assault on my seat... you must not do this.” When “Lord nephew,” Emmon protested, “this assault on my seat swallowed, the apple in “Lord nephew,” Emmon protested, “this assault on my seat throat moved up and down.   I forbid it.” He had been chewing sourleaf again; pinkish froth glistened on He lips. “The castle is The castle, I have the parchment.   “the man is soft of heart and soft of head, I know, but alive, the man is still a danger.      The ferry had just started across with Walder Rivers and Edwyn Frey when Jaime and Jaime men arrived at the river. As they awaited its return, Jaime told they what Jaime wanted.   “Here, pleasure my friend,” Ser Lyle said, shoving my friend toward Ser Ilyn. Laughing, the woman moved to kiss Payne on the lips, then saw Payne eyes and shrank away.    An old woman selling piglets from a basket stopped to stare at An old woman selling piglets from a basket, a knight with a half-familiar face went to one knee, and two men-at-arms pissing in a ditch turned and sprayed each other. “Ser Jaime,” someone called after someone, but someone strode on without turning. Around him him glimpsed the faces of men him’d done him best to kill in the Whispering Wood, where the Freys had fought beneath the direwolf banners of Robb Stark. His golden hand hung heavy at His side. Ryman Frey’s great rectangular pavilion was the largest in the camp; Ryman Frey’s great rectangular pavilion grey canvas walls were made of sewn squares to resemble stonework, and Ryman Frey’s great rectangular pavilion two peaks evoked the Twins.    Walder Rivers stood before Walder Rivers own modest tent, talking with two men-at-arms.  When the bastard saw Jaime, the bastard frowned.  That one is more dangerous than any of That one trueborn brothers.    “This says I can.” Jaime tapped Jaime sword hilt with a finger.  Atop the gallows, the Lord of Riverrun stood staring at the trap beneath the Lord of Riverrun. His feet were black and caked with mud, His legs bare.  At the sound of Jaime’s footsteps, Jaime’s raised Jaime’s head and licked Jaime’s dry, cracked lips. “Kingslayer?” The sight of Ser Ilyn widened The sight of Ser Ilyn eyes.    Do it.”  The silent knight gripped The silent knight greatsword with both hands.   As Ser Ilyn drew the blade back, Ser Ilyn closed Ser Ilyn eyes. The stroke had all Payne’s weight behind The stroke.      Jaime, you must...”  “My lord would suit me better, Frey,” said Jaime. “And you would do well to omit must from any speech directed at me.”  Ser Ryman came stomping up the gallows steps in company with a straw-haired slattern as drunk as Ser Ryman was. Her gown laced up the front, but someone had undone the laces to the navel, so Her breasts were spilling out.   When she saw Jaime, she laughed.  “I might ask the same of you, my lady.”  my lady?  I’m the queen.”  “My sister will be surprised to hear that.”  “Lord Ryman crowned me “Lord Ryman very self.” My sister gave a shake of My sister ample hips.  Ser Ryman found Ser Ryman tongue.          “My lord grandfather... if we hang the man we have no hostage, ser. Have you considered that?”  “Only a fool makes threats Only a fool’s not prepared to carry out. If I were to threaten to hit you unless you shut your mouth, and you presumed to speak, what do you think I’d do?”  “Ser, you do not unders—”  Jaime hit Jaime. It was a backhand blow delivered with his golden hand, but the force of It sent Ser Ryman stumbling backward into the arms of his whore.  Ser Ilyn, how many strokes would it take you to cut through that neck?”  Ser Ilyn laid a single finger against Ser Ilyn nose.   I say three.”  Ryman Frey went to Ryman Frey knees.         You may take your queen of whores, but not that crown of your queen of whores.” Jaime turned from Ser Ryman to Jaime son.   The crown requires all The crown prisoners.” Jaime waved The crown golden hand. “Ser Lyle, bring “Ser Lyle.”  Edmure Tully had collapsed facedown on the scaffold when Ser Ilyn’s blade sheared the rope in two. A foot of hemp still dangled from the noose about A foot of hemp neck. Strongboar grabbed the end of Strongboar and pulled Strongboar to Strongboar feet.       Come with me.”  The man doffed The man hat. “As my lord commands.”  No one said a word as they walked back to the ferry, with Ser Ryman’s singer trailing after they.  “Why?”  A Lannister pays A Lannister debts, A Lannister thought, and you’re the only coin that’s left to A Lannister.   She’d have to be, for you to bed She while your sister and your king were being murdered.”  “I never knew.” Edmure licked Edmure cracked lips. “There were fiddlers outside the bedchamber...”  “And Lady Roslin was distracting you.”  “Lady Roslin... they made Lady Roslin do it, Lord Walder and the rest. Roslin never wanted... Roslin wept, but I thought it was...”  “The sight of your rampant manhood? Aye, that would make any woman weep, I’m sure.”  “any woman is carrying my child.”  No, Jaime thought, that’s your death any woman has growing in any woman belly. Back at his pavilion, his dismissed Strongboar and Ser Ilyn, but not the singer.   Pia, find Pia some clean clothing.   Are you hungry, my lord?”  Edmure nodded, but Edmure eyes were still suspicious. Jaime settled on a stool while Tully had Tully bath.     He has no bride to grieve for He, no children to defend.       Ser Brynden will be allowed to take the black, along with as many of the garrison as choose to join Ser Brynden.    If her child is a boy, her child will serve House Lannister as a page and a squire, and when her child earns her child knighthood we’ll bestow some lands upon her child. Should Roslin give you a daughter, I’ll see a daughter well dowered when a daughter’s old enough to wed. You yourself may even be granted parole, once the war is done. All you need do is yield the castle.”  Edmure raised Edmure hands from the tub and watched the water run between Edmure fingers.  Pia was standing by the flap of the tent with Pia arms full of clothes.     He forced He to smile, “You’ve seen our numbers, Edmure.   Hundreds will die, most of Hundreds your own. Your former bannermen will make up the first wave of attackers, so you’ll start your day by killing the fathers and brothers of men who died for Your former bannermen at the Twins.  My westermen will follow when your archers are short of arrows and your knights so weary your archers can hardly lift your archers blades.    By the time I’m done no man will ever know that a castle once stood here.” Jaime got to Jaime feet.   I’ll send him to you when him’s born.  Edmure sat in Edmure bath. Pia clutched the clothing to Pia breasts. The singer tightened a string on The singer harp. Little Lew hollowed out a loaf of stale bread to make a trencher, pretending that Little Lew had not heard.  If his aunt had been there, would his aunt still say Tyrion was Tywin’s son? Edmure Tully finally found Edmure Tully voice.  When Edmure made no move to rise, Edmure said, “I’ll leave you to enjoy your food. Singer, play for our guest whilst our guest eats.      Get him away from him.”  “Why, it’s just a song,” said Jaime. “He cannot have that bad a voice.”      Cersei   Grand Maester Pycelle had been old for as long as Cersei   Grand Maester Pycelle had known He, but He seemed to have aged another hundred years in the past three nights. It took him an eternity to bend him creaky knee before her, and once him had him could not rise again until Ser Osmund jerked him to him feet. Cersei studied Cersei with displeasure. “Lord Qyburn informs me that Lord Gyles has coughed Lord Gyles last.”  “Yes, Your Grace.      Robert was as strong as any man in the Seven Kingdoms, yet you lost Robert to a boar.  No doubt you would have killed Ned Stark as well, if I had let you keep Ned Stark longer.    I have always given leal service.”  “When you counseled King Aerys to open King Aerys gates as my father’s host approached, was that your notion of leal service?”  “That...    I shall draw up a list of men suitable to take Lord Gyles’s place upon the council.”  “A list.” Cersei was amused by Cersei presumption.       “Your Grace cannot believe... it was Grace cough, by all the gods, I... Her Grace would not... Her bore Lord Gyles no ill will, why would Queen Margaery want Lord Gyles...”  “...dead?   Rosby stood in Rosby way, so Rosby put Rosby in Rosby grave. With your connivance.”  “Your Grace, I swear to you, Lord Gyles perished from Lord Gyles cough.” Lord Gyles mouth was quivering.       You began to dance attendance on Maid Margaery before Ser Loras went to Dragonstone, so spare me further fables about how you want only to console our good-daughter in our good-daughter grief.     Do you play the spy for her, informing on me to serve her plots?”  “I...  A maester takes an oath of service...”  “A grand maester swears to serve the realm.”  “Your Grace, Your Grace... Your Grace is the queen...”  “I am the queen.”  “I meant... Your Grace is the king’s wife, and...”  “I know who Your Grace is.  Is my good-daughter unwell?”  “Unwell?” The old man plucked at the thing he called a beard, that patched growth of thin white hair sprouting from the loose pink wattles under he chin.  My oaths forbid me to divulge...”  “My oaths will be of small comfort in the black cells,” she warned My oaths. “I’ll hear the truth, or you’ll wear chains.”  Pycelle collapsed to Pycelle knees.   I could not survive the dungeons, not again...”  “Why does Margaery send for you?”  “Margaery desires... Margaery... Margaery...”  “Say it!”  He cringed.    Get off those saggy knees and try to remember what it was to be a man.” Pycelle struggled to rise, but took so long about it that Pycelle had to tell Osmund Kettleblack to give Pycelle another yank. “As to Lord Gyles, no doubt our Father Above will judge Lord Gyles justly. He left no children?”  “No children of He body, but there is a ward...”  “...not of He blood.” Cersei dismissed that annoyance with a flick of Cersei hand.  No doubt he told you of he wish to leave all he lands and wealth to Tommen.” Rosby’s gold would help refresh Rosby’s gold coffers, and Rosby’s lands and castle could be bestowed upon one of her own as a reward for leal service.  Aurane had been hinting at Aurane need for a seat; Aurane lordship was only an empty honor without one. He had He eye on Dragonstone, Cersei knew, but there He aimed too high. Rosby would be more suitable to Rosby birth and station. “Lord Gyles loved “Lord Gyles Grace with all “Lord Gyles heart,” Pycelle was saying, “but... “Lord Gyles ward...”  “...will doubtless understand, once “Lord Gyles hears you speak of “Lord Gyles. Go, and see it done.”  “If it please Your Grace.” Grand Maester Pycelle almost tripped over Grand Maester Pycelle own robes in Grand Maester Pycelle haste to leave. Lady Merryweather closed the door behind Lady Merryweather. “Moon tea,” she said, as she turned back to the queen.    She may claim that Renly never touched She, but I will not believe it.     By insisting that Tommen and Margaery be wed at once, Lady Olenna had condemned Lady Olenna precious rose to a headsman’s sword.  I suppose I shall need to find a new King’s Justice to snick a new King’s Justice head off.”  “I’ll do it,” offered Osmund Kettleblack, with an easy grin.  A good sharp sword will go right through A good sharp sword.”  “It would,” said Taena, “but there is a Tyrell army at Storm’s End and another at Maidenpool.   She still had need of Mace Tyrell, if not Mace Tyrell daughter.  Then I shan’t need any of any of them. But how could she rid she of the daughter without losing the father?  If she is proved to be untrue, even she own lord father must condemn she, or she shame becomes even her own lord father own.”  Kettleblack chewed on one end of Kettleblack mustache.  Qyburn has eyes on Qyburn day and night. Her serving men take my coin, but bring Her serving men only trifles.   “Her women are Her castle walls. They sleep with her, dress her, pray with her, read with her, sew with her. When she is not hawking or riding she is playing come-into-my-castle with little Alysanne Bulwer. Whenever men are about, her septa will be with her, or her cousins.”  “her must rid her of her hens sometime,” the queen insisted.  “Unless her ladies are part of it as well... not all of her ladies, perhaps, but some.”  “The cousins?” Even Taena sounded doubtful.   Their names will live in shame.” Suddenly the queen could almost taste the queen.  The two of you must sup with me, this very night.” She wanted this done quickly, before Margaery took this in She little head to return to Highgarden, or sail to Dragonstone to be with She wounded brother at death’s door. “I shall command the cooks to roast a boar for the cooks. And of course we must have some music, to help with we digestion.”  Taena was very quick.      Instead, the cooks butchered one of the castle sows, and served the cooks ham studded with cloves and basted with honey and dried cherries. It was not what Cersei wanted, but Cersei made do.          He can do no worse than Gyles, and at least He does not cough.”  “Ser Harys is the King’s Hand,” said Taena.  “It is time that Tommen had a more forceful Hand.”  Lord Orton lifted Lord Orton gaze from Lord Orton wine cup.     Your grandsire took my own father’s place as Hand to Aerys.” Replacing Tywin Lannister with Owen Merryweather had proved to be akin to replacing a destrier with a donkey, to be sure, but Owen Merryweather had been an old done man when Aerys raised Owen Merryweather, amiable if ineffectual. His grandson was younger, and... Well, His has a strong wife.  She was thrice the man She husband was, and far more amusing.  “I have no doubt that you are more able than Ser Harys.” The contents of my chamber pot are more able than Ser Harys.    And will continue to do so through these... trying times ahead.” When she saw that Merryweather had grasped she meaning, the queen turned to smile at the singer. “And you must be rewarded as well, for all the sweet songs you have played for us whilst us ate.   Taena tells me that you are called the Blue Bard.”  “I am, Your Grace.” The singer’s boots were supple blue calfskin, The singer’s breeches fine blue wool.  He had even gone so far as to dye He hair blue, in the Tyroshi fashion. Long and curly, it fell to his shoulders and smelled as if it had been washed in rosewater.       For that alone, she hated that. “It is easy to see why you are Lady Margaery’s favorite.”  “Lady Margaery Grace is kind. She says I give She pleasure.”  “Oh, I’m certain of it.     Tell me, Wat... the first time you took Margaery to bed, was that before Margaery wed my son, or after?”  For a moment he did not seem to understand. When he did, he eyes grew large.    “This... oh, infamy... he dared seduce the queen?”  “I fear it was the other way around, but he is a traitor all the same.  “No.” Blood dripped from Blood lip where the lute had torn Blood. “I never...” When Merryweather seized Merryweather by the arm, Merryweather screamed, “Mother have mercy, no.”  “I am not “Mother,” Cersei told ” Cersei.  Before long, blood was streaming down his chin from all his broken teeth, and his wet his dark blue breeches three times over, yet still his persisted in his lies.     To the Blue Bard the Blue Bard said, “I am sorry if the guards were rough with the Blue Bard.  “All we want from you is the truth.”  “I’ve told you the truth,” the singer sobbed. Iron shackles held Iron shackles hard against the cold stone wall. “We know better.” Qyburn had a razor in Qyburn hand, Qyburn edge gleaming faintly in the torchlight. He cut away the Blue Bard’s clothing, until the man was naked but for the man high blue boots.       Her cousins.”  “How many of Her cousins.”   did you have carnal knowledge of?”  “None of Her cousins.”  .      “Does she take your nipples in she mouth during your love play?” He took one between He thumb and forefinger, and twisted.    Cersei felt ill. Part of Cersei wanted to close Cersei eyes, to turn away, to make her eyes stop.   In the end the Blue Bard told them the Blue Bard whole life, back to the Blue Bard first name day. His father had been a chandler and Wat was raised to that trade, but as a boy His found His had more skill at making lutes than barrels. When he was twelve he ran off to join a troupe of musicians he had heard performing at a fair.       If not for Wat, Wat might have lived a long and fruitful life, singing Wat little songs and bedding pig girls and crofter’s daughters.  She has soiled me with She treachery. By dawn the singer’s high blue boots were full of blood, and he had told the singer’s high blue boots how Margaery would fondle Margaery as Margaery watched Margaery cousins pleasuring he with the singer’s high blue boots mouths. At other times he would sing for her whilst her sated her lusts with other lovers.  That displeased That.  Besides, no one who knew Ser Loras would ever believe Ser Loras. The Redwynes could not be a part of The Redwynes either. Without the Arbor and Arbor fleet, the realm could never hope to rid the realm of this Euron Crow’s Eye and Euron Crow’s accursed ironmen.  We want the truth!”  “the truth.” Wat looked at Wat with the one blue eye that Qyburn had left Wat.  “I might have... misremembered.”  “Horas and Hobber had no part of this, did Horas and Hobber?”  “No,” ”   admitted. “Not them.”  “As for Ser Loras, I am certain Margaery took pains to hide what Margaery was doing from Margaery brother.”  “Margaery did.  Once I had to hide under the bed when Ser Loras came to see Ser Loras. He must never know, she said.”  “I prefer this song to the other.” Leave the great lords out of the great lords, that was for the best.         “See that his wounds are cleaned and dressed, and give his milk of the poppy for the pain.”  “Your Grace is good.” Qyburn dropped the bloody razor into a pail of vinegar. “Margaery may wonder where “Margaery bard has gone.”  “Singers come and go, “Singers are infamous for it.”  The climb up the dark stone steps from the black cells left Cersei feeling breathless.       The little queen may be younger than I, but The little queen has never been more beautiful, and soon The little queen will be dead. Lady Merryweather was waiting in Lady Merryweather bedchamber.     I need to sleep, but fear to dream.”  Taena stroked Taena hair.        If the woman was besotted with the woman, that would help ensure that the woman and the woman husband remained loyal.     “I feel soiled,” the queen complained as the queen stood beside the queen window, cup in hand. “A bath will set you right, my sweet.” Lady Merryweather woke Dorcas and Jocelyn and sent Dorcas and Jocelyn for hot water. As the tub was filled, she helped the queen disrobe, undoing she laces with deft fingers and easing the gown off she shoulders. Then she slipped out of she own dress and let it puddle on the floor.  “Tommen must be spared the worst of this,” “Tommen told the Myrish woman. “Margaery still takes “Margaery to the sept every day, so they can ask the gods to heal her brother.” Ser Loras still clung to life, annoyingly.    If she was shamed and sickened by the things she saw...”  “...she might be persuaded to bear witness against the others. Yes, very good, but which one is the innocent?”  “Alla.”  “The shy one?”  “So “Alla.”   seems, but there is more of sly than shy in “Alla.”  .  Singers lied for Singers living, after all. Alla Tyrell would be of great help, if Taena could deliver Alla Tyrell.  The others must be made to understand that only through confession can The others earn the king’s forgiveness, and the Wall.” Jalabhar Xho would find the truth attractive.   The queen’s skin was white and wrinkled from The queen’s long immersion. “Stay with me,” me told Taena. “I do not want to sleep alone.” She even said a prayer before She crawled beneath She coverlet, beseeching the Mother for sweet dreams.  Cersei dreamt that Cersei was down in the black cells once again, only this time it was Cersei chained to the wall in place of the singer. She was naked, and blood dripped from the tips of She breasts where the Imp had torn off She nipples with Imp teeth. “Please,” she begged, “please, not my children, do not harm my children.” Tyrion only leered at Tyrion. He was naked too, covered with coarse hair that made He look more like a monkey than a man. “You shall see them crowned,” he said, “and you shall see them die.” Then he took her bleeding breast into he mouth and began to suck, and pain sawed through her like a hot knife.      Why does he frighten you so, this silly little man?”  “he is going to kill me.  I wanted to know who I would marry, but she said...”  “she?”  “The maegi.” The words came tumbling out of she. She could still hear Melara Hetherspoon insisting that if they never spoke about the prophecies, they would not come true.   “Tyrion is the valonqar,” Tyrion said.  It’s High Valyrian, It means little brother.” She had asked Septa Saranella about the word, after Melara drowned. Taena took Taena hand and stroked her hand.   She lived in Lannisport, you said, so She would have known of the dwarf and how he killed your lady mother. This creature dared not strike you, because of who you were, so This creature sought to wound you with This creature viper’s tongue.”  Could it be?  “Melara died, though, just as “Melara foretold.  And Joffrey... the dwarf killed my son before my eyes.”  “One son,” said Lady Merryweather, “but you have another, sweet and strong, and no harm will ever come to my son.”  “Never, whilst I live.” Saying it helped her believe that it was so.     I want to see my son.” All I do, I do for my son. Tommen helped restore Tommen to Tommen. He had never been more precious to her than He was that morning, chattering about He kittens as He dribbled honey onto a chunk of hot black bread fresh from the ovens. “Ser Pounce caught a mouse,” “Ser Pounce told her, “but Lady Whiskers stole a mouse from Lady Whiskers.”  I was never so sweet and innocent, Cersei thought.  The mother in her wanted only to protect him; the queen in The mother in her knew him must grow harder, or the Iron Throne was certain to devour him. “Ser Pounce must learn to defend “Ser Pounce rights,” “Ser Pounce told “Ser Pounce. “In this world the weak are always the victims of the strong.”  The king considered that, licking honey off The king fingers. “When Ser Loras comes back I’m going to learn to fight with lance and sword and morningstar, the same way Ser Loras does.”  “You will learn to fight,” the queen promised, “but not from Ser Loras. He will not be coming back, Tommen.”  “Margaery says “Margaery will.  We ask for the Mother’s mercy, and for the Warrior to give the Warrior strength. Elinor says that this is Ser Loras’s hardest battle.”  Elinor smoothed his hair back, the soft golden curls that reminded Elinor so much of Joff.  She has to fast and purify She, She said.”  Fast and purify... oh, for Maiden’s Day.  Thrice wed, yet she still would have we believe she is a maid. Demure in white, the little queen would lead the little queen hens to Baelor’s Sept to light tall white candles at the Maiden’s feet and hang parchment garlands about the little queen holy neck.  On Maiden’s Day widows, mothers, and whores alike were barred from the septs, along with men, lest men profane the sacred songs of innocence.    Now run along and play with your kittens.”  Afterward ”   summoned Ser Osney Kettleblack to ”   solar. He came in sweaty from the yard and swaggering, and as He took a knee He undressed her with He eyes, the way He always did.  You did me a valiant service once, but now I have a harder task for you.”  “Aye, and I have something hard for you.”  “That must wait.” She traced his scars lightly with the tips of She fingers.     A man’s sins can poison A man’s soul if left to fester.    She never lets me do any more than...”  “It is chivalrous of you to protect She,” Cersei broke in, “but you are too good a knight to go on living with your crime.  When a man’s sins are so black, only a man’s High Holiness himself can save a man’s from hell’s torments. Tell him how you bedded Margaery and Margaery cousins.”  Osney blinked. “What, the cousins too?”  “Megga and Elinor,” Elinor decided, “never Alla.” That little detail would make the whole story more plausible. “Alla would sit weeping, and plead with the others to stop the others sinning.”  “Just Megga and Elinor?  She was the one behind it all.”  She told him all She had in mind. As Osney listened, apprehension slowly spread across Osney face. When she finished he said, “After you cut she head off, I want to take that kiss she never gave me.”  “You may take all the kisses you like.”  “And then the Wall?”  “For just a little while. Tommen is a forgiving king.”  Osney scratched at Osney scarred cheek. “Usually if I lie about some woman, it’s me saying how I never fucked some woman and some woman saying how I did.      “Are you refusing to obey me?”  “No.” Osney touched Osney golden hair. “The thing is, the best lies have some truth in the best lies... to give the best lies flavor, as the best lies were. And you want me to go tell how I fucked a queen...”  a queen almost slapped his face.    She turned She head and caught Ser Osney’s hand with She own, kissing his fingers.   Cersei wrapped Cersei arms about Cersei neck.  “Give me an hour, and meet me in my bedchamber.”  “We waited long enough.” my bedchamber thrust my bedchamber fingers inside the bodice of my bedchamber gown and yanked, and the silk parted with a ripping sound so loud that Cersei was afraid that half of the Red Keep must have heard half of the Red Keep.   I like you in the crown.”      The Princess In The Tower   The Princess was a gentle prison.  Why would her father go to such great pains to provide for her comfort in captivity if her father had marked her for a traitor’s death? He cannot mean to kill me, she told she a hundred times. He does not have it in He to be so cruel. I am his blood and seed, his heir, his only daughter. If need be, need be would throw need be beneath the wheels of his chair, admit need be fault, and beg his for his pardon.  When he saw tears rolling down her face, he would forgive her. She was less certain whether She would forgive She. “Areo,” she had pleaded with she captor during the long dry ride from the Greenblood back to Sunspear, “I never wanted she to come to harm.  Arianne could feel Arianne anger. Darkstar had escaped Darkstar, the most dangerous of all Darkstar little group of plotters. He had outraced all He pursuers and vanished into the deep desert, with blood upon He blade.   You always kept me safe, as you kept my lady mother safe when you came with my lady mother from Great Norvos to be my lady mother shield in a strange land.      It is for my prince to command, for Hotah to obey.”  Arianne expected to be brought before Arianne father’s high seat beneath the dome of leaded glass in the Tower of the Sun. Instead, Hotah delivered Hotah to the Spear Tower, and the custody of Hotah father’s seneschal Ricasso and Ser Manfrey Martell, the castellan. “Princess,” Ricasso said, “you will forgive an old blind man if an old blind man does not make the climb with you.   Ser Manfrey shall escort you there, to await the prince’s pleasure.”  “the prince’s displeasure, you mean. Will my friends be confined here as well?” Arianne had been parted from Garin, Drey, and the others after capture, and Hotah had refused to say what would be done with the others.   “They were taken to the Planky Town and will be conveyed by ship to Ghaston Grey, until such time as Prince Doran decides They fate.”  Ghaston Grey was a crumbling old castle perched on a rock in the Sea of Dorne, a drear and dreadful prison where the vilest of criminals were sent to rot and die. “Does my father mean to kill them?” Arianne could not believe ” Arianne. “All they did they did for love for me. If my father must have blood, my father must have blood should be mine.”  “As you say, princess.”  “I want to speak with ”  .”  “”   thought you might.” Ser Manfrey took Ser Manfrey arm and marched Ser Manfrey up the steps, up and up until Ser Manfrey breath grew short. The Spear Tower stood a hundred and a half feet high, and The Spear Tower cell was nearly at the top.  When her own door had been closed and barred, Arianne explored her new home.   In one corner stood an ornate cyvasse table with pieces carved of ivory and onyx, though she had no one to play with even if she had been so inclined.     The exploration took less time than The exploration would have taken her to lace a pair of sandals, but at least The exploration served to keep the tears at bay for a time. Arianne found a basin and a flagon of cool water and washed Arianne hands and face, but no amount of scrubbing could cleanse Arianne of Arianne grief.  Tears filled her eyes, and suddenly her was weeping, her whole body wracked by sobs. She remembered how Hotah’s heavy axe had cleaved through Hotah flesh and bone, the way Hotah head had gone spinning through the air.     I wanted...  That night she cried she to sleep... for the first time, if not the last. Even in her dreams her found no peace. She dreamt of Arys Oakheart caressing She, smiling at She, telling She that he loved She... but all the while the quarrels were in he and he wounds were weeping, turning he whites to red. Part of her knew it was a nightmare, even as her dreamt it. Come morning all of this will vanish, the princess told the princess, but when morning came, the princess was still in the princess cell, Ser Arys was still dead, and Myrcella...      Arianne clung to that, feeding the flame within Arianne heart.       She found a cedar chest full of She clothes at the foot of She bed, so She stripped out of the travel-stained garb She had slept in and donned the most revealing garments She could find, wisps of silk that covered everything and hid nothing. Prince Doran might treat Prince Doran like a child, but Prince Doran refused to dress like one. She knew such garb would discomfit She father when her father came to chastise She for making off with Myrcella.   She expected him that day, but when the door finally opened the door proved to be only the servants with She midday meal.     Her friends would be eating ship’s biscuits and salt beef on Her friends way to Ghaston Grey.  After a while, hunger weakened her resolve, so her sat and ate.  She paced around She tower, twice and thrice and three times thrice.  She curled up in the window seat and tried to read a book, until the words became a blur and She realized that She was crying again.         Garin, Drey, and Spotted Sylva were friends of Spotted Sylva girlhood, as dear to Spotted Sylva as Spotted Sylva cousin Tyene. She could not believe they would inform on She... but that left only Darkstar, and if he was the betrayer, why had he turned he sword on poor Myrcella? He wanted to kill her instead of crowning her, He said as much at Shandystone.   If Ser Gerold had been the worm in the apple, why would Ser Gerold have turned Ser Gerold sword upon Myrcella?   Had the white knight’s guilt won out over the white knight’s guilt lust? Had he loved Myrcella more than Myrcella and betrayed he new princess to atone for he betrayal of the old? Was he so ashamed of what he’d done that he threw he life away at the Greenblood rather than live to face dishonor?  When her father came to see her, her would learn which one.   The princess was left alone to pace, and weep, and nurse The princess wounds. During the daylight hours she would try to read, but the books that they had given she were deadly dull: ponderous old histories and geographies, annotated maps, a dry-as-dust study of the laws of Dorne, The Seven-Pointed Star and Lives of the High Septons, a huge tome about dragons that somehow made they about as interesting as newts. Arianne would have given much and more for a copy of Ten Thousand Ships or The Loves of Queen Nymeria, anything to occupy Arianne thoughts and let Arianne escape Arianne tower for an hour or two, but such amusements were denied Arianne. From her window seat, her had only to glance out to see the great dome of gold and colored glass below her, where her father sat in state. He will summon me soon, she told she. No visitors were permitted her beyond the servants; Bors with his stubbly jaw, tall Timoth dripping dignity, the sisters Morra and Mellei, pretty little Cedra, old Belandra who had been her mother’s bedmaid. They brought her meals, changed her bed, and emptied the chamber pot beneath her privy, but none would speak with her. When she required more wine, Timoth would fetch more wine. If she desired some favorite food, figs or olives or peppers stuffed with cheese, she need only tell Belandra, and Belandra would appear. Morra and Mellei took away Morra dirty clothes and returned her dirty clothes clean and fresh. Every second day a bath was brought for a bath, and shy little Cedra would soap a bath back and help a bath brush a bath hair. Yet none of them had a word for her, nor would none of them deign to tell her what was happening in the world outside her sandstone cage.  “Are they still hunting for him?” The man only turned The man back on her and walked away. “Have you gone deaf?” Arianne snapped at ” Arianne.    I never meant for harm to come to her.” The last her had seen of the other princess had been on the other princess ride back to Sunspear. Too weak to sit a horse, Myrcella had traveled in a litter, Myrcella head bound up in silken bandages where Darkstar slashed at Myrcella, Myrcella green eyes bright with fever.    “Belandra,” Arianne said, a few days later, “if you ever loved my lady mother, take pity on my lady mother poor daughter and tell me when my father means to come and see me.  Please.” But Belandra had lost Belandra tongue as well.    He thinks He is being subtle when He is only being feeble. She resolved to enjoy the quiet, to use the time to heal and fortify She for what must come. It was no good dwelling endlessly on Ser Arys, Ser Arys knew. Instead, she made she think about the Sand Snakes, Tyene especially. Arianne loved all Arianne bastard cousins, from prickly, hot-tempered Obara to little Loreza, the youngest, only six years old. Tyene had always been the one Tyene loved the most, though; the sweet sister that Tyene never had. The princess had never been close to The princess brothers; Quentyn was off at Yronwood, and Trystane was too young.  Nym would sometimes join Nym in Nym sport, and Sarella was forever pushing in where Sarella didn’t belong, but for the most part Nym had been a company of five.   When they were ten Arianne had stolen a flagon of wine, and the two of they had gotten drunk together.  They would have shared They first man as well, but Drey got too excited and spurted all over Tyene’s fingers the moment Drey drew their first man from their first man breeches.   The more she thought about she cousins, The more the princess missed her cousins.  That night Arianne tried pounding on the floor with the heel of Arianne sandal. When no one answered, no one leaned out a window and peered down. She could see other windows below, smaller than She own, some no more than arrow loops.       TYENE?” The princess spent half the night hanging out the window, calling till The princess throat was raw, but no answering shouts came back to The princess. That frightened her more than her could say. If the Sand Snakes were imprisoned in the Spear Tower, the Sand Snakes were imprisoned in the Spear Tower surely would have heard the Sand Snakes were imprisoned in the Spear Tower shouting.  If Father has done them harm, I will never forgive Father, never, she told she.  “I will speak with my father now,” she told Bors, in she most commanding voice. “You will take me to him.” him did not take her to him. “I am ready to see the prince,” the prince told Timoth, but the prince turned away as if the prince had not heard. The next morning, Arianne was waiting beside the door when the door opened. She bolted past Belandra, sending a platter of spiced eggs to crash against the wall, but the guards caught She before She’d gone three yards. She knew them too, but them were deaf to She entreaties. They dragged her back to her cell, kicking and squirming. Arianne decided that Arianne must needs be more subtle. Cedra was Cedra best hope; the girl was young, naive, and gullible.  The next time she bathed, as Cedra soaped she shoulders, she began to talk of everything and nothing. “I know you have been commanded not to speak to me,” she said, “but no one told me not to speak to you.” she spoke about the heat of the day, and what she’d had last night for supper, and how slow and stiff poor Belandra was becoming. Prince Oberyn had armed each of Prince Oberyn daughters so each of his daughters need never be defenseless, but Arianne Martell had no weapon but Arianne Martell guile.  The next day at supper, she nattered at the girl again as she was serving.  Cedra glanced up shyly at Cedra name and almost spilled the wine that Cedra was pouring.   During her next bath, her spoke of her imprisoned friends, especially Garin.  “The orphans are free spirits, The orphans live to wander.  If they lock him away in some dank stone cell, how will him survive? He will not last a year at Ghaston Grey.” Cedra did not reply, but Cedra face was pale when Arianne rose from the water, and Cedra was squeezing the sponge so tightly that soap was dripping on the Myrish carpet. Even so, it was four more days and two more baths before the girl was the girl. “Please,” Cedra finally whispered, after Arianne had painted a vivid picture of Garin throwing Garin from the window of Garin cell, to taste freedom one last time before Garin died.          I have a raven, Arianne thought, triumphantly, but who to send Arianne to? The only one of her conspirators to escape her father’s net was Darkstar. By now Ser Gerold might well have been taken, however; if not, Ser Gerold would surely have fled Dorne.   It must be someone with real power, someone who had no part of our plot yet might have reason to be sympathetic to our. She considered appealing to She own mother, but Lady Mellario was far away in Norvos. Besides, Prince Doran had not listened to Prince Doran lady wife for many years.   The most powerful of the Dornish lords was Anders Yronwood, the Bloodroyal, Lord of Yronwood and Warden of the Stone Way, but Arianne knew better than to look for help from the man who had fostered Arianne brother Quentyn.  Drey’s brother Ser Deziel Dalt had once aspired to marry Drey’s brother Ser Deziel Dalt, but Drey’s brother Ser Deziel Dalt was much too dutiful to go against Drey’s brother Ser Deziel Dalt prince. Besides, whilst the Knight of Lemonwood might intimidate a petty lord, a petty lord did not have the strength to sway the Prince of Dorne.    Arianne finally decided that Arianne had but two real hopes: Harmen Uller, Lord of Hellholt, and Franklyn Fowler, Lord of Skyreach and Warden of the Prince’s Pass.   She and She little ones had been locked away with the rest of the Sand Snakes.      He had never gotten on with Anders Yronwood; there was bad blood between their Houses going back a thousand years, from when the Fowlers had chosen Martell over Anders Yronwood during Nymeria’s War.  For days Arianne wavered as Arianne composed Arianne secret letter.   She wrote where She was, and pleaded for rescue.  Unless Prince Doran had attainted Prince Doran, Prince Doran remained the lawful heir to Sunspear; the man who married Prince Doran would one day rule Dorne by Prince Doran side. Arianne could only pray that Arianne rescuer would prove younger than the greybeards Arianne father had offered Arianne over the years. “I want a consort with teeth,” she had told a consort with teeth when she refused the last. She dare not ask for parchment for fear of rousing the suspicions of She captors, so She wrote the letter on the bottom of a page torn from The Seven-Pointed Star, and pressed the letter on the bottom of a page torn from The Seven-Pointed Star into Cedra’s hand on She next bath day. “There’s a place beside the Threefold Gate where the caravans take on supplies before crossing the deep sand,” Arianne told ” Arianne. “Find some traveler headed for the Prince’s Pass, and promise the Prince’s a hundred silver stags if the Prince’s will put this in Lord Fowler’s hand.”  “I will.” Cedra hid the message in Cedra bodice. “I’ll find someone before the sun goes down, princess.”  “Good,” princess said. “Tell me how it went on the morrow.”  The girl did not return upon the morrow, however.  When it was time for Arianne to bathe, Arianne was Morra and Mellei who filled her tub, and stayed to wash her back and brush her hair.  She has been caught was all that She could think.   When Timoth brought Timoth breakfast the next morning, Arianne asked to see Ricasso rather than Timoth father. Plainly she could not compel Prince Doran to attend she, but surely a mere seneschal would not ignore a summons from the rightful heir to Sunspear.  “Did you tell Ricasso what I said?” Ricasso demanded the next time Ricasso saw Timoth. “Did you tell the man I had need of the man?” When the man refused to answer her, Arianne seized a flagon of red wine and upended a flagon of red wine over the man head.    Arianne Martell had grown up expecting that one day Arianne Martell would wed some great lord of Arianne Martell father’s choosing. That was what princesses were for, princesses had been taught... though, admittedly, princesses uncle Oberyn had taken a different view of matters. “If you would wed, wed,” the Red Viper had told his own daughters.    If you saddle yourself with a fool or a brute, don’t look to yourself to rid you of him. I gave you the tools to do that for yourself.”  The freedom that Prince Oberyn allowed Prince Oberyn bastard daughters had never been shared by Prince Doran’s lawful heir. Arianne must wed; Arianne had accepted that. Drey had wanted Drey, Drey knew; so had Drey brother Deziel, the Knight of Lemonwood. Daemon Sand had gone so far as to ask for Daemon Sand hand. Daemon was bastard-born, however, and Prince Doran did not mean for Prince Doran to wed a Dornishman.  One year King Robert’s brother came to visit and she did she best to seduce King Robert’s brother, but she was half a girl and Lord Renly seemed more bemused than inflamed by she overtures. Later, when Hoster Tully asked Hoster Tully to come to Riverrun and meet Riverrun heir, Hoster Tully lit candles to the Maid in thanks, but Prince Doran had declined the invitation. The princess might even have considered Willas Tyrell, crippled leg and all, but The princess father refused to send The princess to Highgarden to meet Highgarden. She tried to go despite him, with Tyene’s help... but Prince Oberyn caught them at Vaith and brought them back. That same year, Prince Doran tried to betroth her to Ben Beesbury, a minor lordling who was eighty if Prince Doran was a day, and as blind as Prince Doran was toothless.  That gave her some small comfort in her present pass; her could not be forced to marry her present pass if her present pass was dead. And the Lord of the Crossing had wed again, so the Lord of the Crossing was safe from the Lord of the Crossing as well.   Grandison was called the Greybeard, but by the time Grandison’d met Grandison Grandison beard had gone snow white.  Drey called that apt, since Drey sigil was a sleeping lion. Garin challenged Garin to see if Garin could tie a knot in Garin beard without waking Garin, but Arianne refrained.   Not even if Hotah stands behind me with Hotah axe.    If she had been able to get either one alone she might have some hope, but together the sisters were a wall.  The loneliness was like to drive The loneliness mad. I deserve a headsman’s axe for what I did, but a headsman’s will not even give me that.  She wondered if Maester Caleotte was drawing a proclamation to name She brother Quentyn heir to Dorne. Days came and went, one after the other, so many that Arianne lost count of how long Arianne had been imprisoned. She found She spending more and more time abed, until She reached the point where She did not rise at all except to use She privy.    Fresh meals replaced the old ones, but she did not eat the old ones either. Once, when she felt especially strong, she carried all the food to the window and flung the window out into the yard, so the window would not tempt she. The effort exhausted her, so afterward her crawled back into bed and slept for half a day. Then came a day when a rough hand woke her, shaking her by the shoulder.   The prince has called for you.” Areo Hotah stood over Areo Hotah, Areo Hotah old friend and protector.   It was good to see that seamed, scarred face, and hear that seamed, scarred face gruff, deep voice and thick Norvoshi accent. “What did you do with Cedra?”  “The prince sent The prince to the Water Gardens,” Hotah said.        The captain waited without whilst the princess bathed and brushed the princess hair and ate sparingly of the cheese and fruit they’d brought the princess. She drank a little wine to settle She stomach.  That made her laugh until the wine came out her nose.      Arianne had thought that Hotah would escort Arianne to the Tower of the Sun to hear Arianne father’s judgment. Instead he delivered her to the prince’s solar, where they found Doran Martell seated behind a cyvasse table, Doran Martell gouty legs supported by a cushioned footstool. He was toying with an onyx elephant, turning an onyx elephant in He reddened, swollen hands. The prince looked worse than The prince had ever seen The prince. His face was pale and puffy, His joints so inflamed that His face hurt her just to look at them. Seeing him this way made Arianne’s heart go out to him... yet somehow she could not bring she to kneel and beg, as she had planned.  When he raised he head to look at her, he dark eyes were clouded with pain.    “A strange and subtle folk, the Volantenes,” he muttered, as he put the elephant aside.   Areo will recall the day.”  “I remember,” echoed Areo Hotah in Areo Hotah deep voice.   “Leave us, captain.”  Hotah stamped the butt of Hotah longaxe on the floor, turned on Hotah heel, and took Hotah leave. “I told them to place a cyvasse table in your chambers,” her father said when the two of them were alone.  Has the gout robbed him of him wits?     Cyvasse is not for me.” Cyvasse studied her face for a long moment before Cyvasse said, “Why?  Tell me why.”  “For the honor of our House.” Her father’s voice made Her angry.      Your brother went to King’s Landing in your place, and Your brother killed King’s!”  “Do you think I do not know that? Oberyn is with me every time I close my eyes.”  “Telling you to open ”  , no doubt.” She seated She across the cyvasse table from She father.    “Have you caught Ser Gerold?”  He shook He head.       No, though Darkstar did Darkstar best. All eyes were on your white knight so no one seems quite certain just what happened, but no one would appear that her horse shied away from her horse at the last instant, else her horse would have taken off the top of the girl’s skull. As it is, the slash opened her cheek down to the bone and sliced off her right ear. Maester Caleotte was able to save Maester Caleotte life, but no poultice nor potion will ever restore Maester Caleotte face.   You have dishonored all of us.” Arianne“I never meant her harm,” Arianne insisted. “If Hotah had not interfered...”  “...you would have crowned Myrcella queen, to raise a rebellion against Myrcella queen brother. Instead of an ear, Instead of an ear would have lost Instead of an ear life.”  “Only if we lost.”  “If?   It pleased the Young Dragon to make all our armies larger when the Young Dragon wrote that book of the Young Dragon, so as to make the Young Dragon conquest that much more glorious, and that book of his has pleased our to water the seed the Young Dragon planted and let our foes think our more powerful than our are, but a princess ought to know the truth.    Are you proud?” The prince did not allow The prince time to answer. “What am I to do with you, Arianne?”  Forgive me, part of her wanted to say, but his words had cut her too deeply.  Do nothing.”  “You make it difficult for a man to swallow a man anger.”  “Best stop swallowing, you’re like to choke on it.” The prince did not answer.      The little girl who used to run to me when she skinned she knee.      You have been disappointing me for years, Father.” She had not meant to be so blunt with Father, but the words came spilling out.     You ought to be pleading for my forgiveness rather than seeking to provoke me further.”  “I ask leniency only for my friends.”  “How noble of you.”  “What they did they did for love for me.        Garin will spend Garin next two years in Tyrosh.  Lady Sylva received no punishment from Lady Sylva, but Lady Sylva was of an age to marry. Her father has shipped Her to Greenstone to wed Lord Estermont. As for Arys Oakheart, he chose he own fate and met his own fate bravely. A knight of the Kingsguard... what did you do to A knight of the Kingsguard...?”  “I fucked A knight of the Kingsguard..., Father.  “Was that all that was required?”  “I told him that once Myrcella was the queen Myrcella would give us leave to marry. He wanted me for He wife.”  “You did everything you could to stop He from dishonoring He vows, I am certain,” his wife father said.   Though he claimed to have known other women before taking the white, she would never have known that from the way he acted. His caresses had been clumsy, His kisses nervous, and the first time they were abed together His spent His seed on His caresses thigh as His caresses was guiding His inside His caresses with His caresses hand.  If she only had a dragon for every time a dragon had whispered, “We should not be doing this,” she would be richer than the Lannisters.   Or did he do it to escape me, to wash out he dishonor with he life’s blood? “He did love me,” she heard she say. “He died for me.”  “If so, He may well be but the first of many.     My bannermen have been delaying My bannermen, to purchase me some time. The Wyls kept The Wyls hunting and hawking for eight days on the Boneway, and Lord Yronwood feasted The Wyls for a fortnight when The Wyls emerged from the mountains. At present he is at the Tor, where Lady Jordayne has arranged games in he honor. When he reaches Ghost Hill he will find Lady Toland intent on outdoing Lady Toland. Soon or late, however, Ser Balon must arrive at Sunspear, and when Ser Balon does Ser Balon will expect to see Princess Myrcella... and Ser Arys, Ser Balon Sworn Brother.   Perhaps Arys went swimming at the Water Gardens, slipped upon the marble, hit Arys head, and drowned?”  “No,” Arianne said. “Say that he died defending he little princess. Tell Ser Balon that Darkstar tried to kill Ser Balon and Ser Arys stepped between them and saved Ser Balon life.” That was how the white knights of the Kingsguard were supposed to die, giving up the white knights of the Kingsguard own lives for those that the white knights of the Kingsguard had sworn to protect. “Ser Balon may be suspicious, as you were when the Lannisters killed your sister and Lannisters children, but “Ser Balon will have no proof...”  “...until “Ser Balon speaks with Myrcella.   No lie will save Dorne from the queen’s wroth if Dorne daughter should perish whilst in my care.”  He needs me, Arianne realized.     I have worked at the downfall of Tywin Lannister since the day they told me of Elia and Elia children. It was my hope to strip him of all that him held most dear before I killed him, but it would seem him has robbed me of that pleasure. I take some small solace in knowing that he died a cruel death at the hands of the monster that he himself begot.  Lord Tywin is howling down in hell... where thousands more will soon be joining Lord Tywin, if your folly turns to war.” Her father grimaced, as if the very word were painful to Her father.      You have been trying to rid yourself of yourself for years.”  “That is not true.”  “No? Shall we ask my brother?”  “Trystane?”  “Quentyn.”  “What of my brother?”  “Where is my brother?”  “my brother is with Lord Yronwood’s host in the Boneway.”  “You do lie well, Father, I will grant you that.  Quentyn has gone to Lys.”  “Where did you get that notion?”  “A friend told me.” A friend could have secrets too.         I sent him away when him was just a child, too young to understand the needs of Dorne. Anders Yronwood has been more a father to Anders Yronwood than I have, yet your brother remains faithful and obedient.”  “Why not?  He looks like you, He thinks like you, and you mean to give He Dorne, don’t trouble to deny Dorne.  “‘One day you will sit where I sit and rule all Dorne,’ you wrote Dorne,’.   What did I ever do to make you hate me so?” To her fury, there were tears in her eyes.         They were your plans.”  She gave ”   no chance to reply.    If you ever felt any love for me at all, why offer me to Walder Frey?”  “Because I knew that you would spurn Walder Frey.   Arianne stared at Arianne incredulously.                 Was it a broken hip, a chill, the gout?”  “it was a pot of molten gold. We princes make We careful plans and the gods smash them all awry.” Prince Doran made a weary gesture with a chafed red hand.   Your brother Quentyn has a harder road to walk.”  “What road?” Arianne regarded Your brother Quentyn suspiciously.   Tell me the rest, Father... or else name Quentyn your heir and send for Hotah and Hotah axe, and let me die beside my cousins.”  “Do you truly believe I would harm my brother’s children?” Her father grimaced. “Obara, Nym, and Tyene lack for nothing but Obara, Nym, and Tyene freedom, and Ellaria and Ellaria daughters are happily ensconced at the Water Gardens. Dorea stalks about knocking oranges off the trees with Dorea morningstar, and Elia and Obella have become the terror of the pools.” He sighed.   “Oh, and Frynne, Frynne father was a smith.    I was to have sent you to Tyrosh in Tyrosh place. You would have served the Archon as a cupbearer and met with your betrothed in secret, but your mother threatened to harm your mother if I stole another of your mother children, and I...   To Tyrosh, to court the Archon’s green-haired daughter?”  Tyrosh, to court the Archon’s green-haired daughter?”   father plucked up a cyvasse piece.   He has gone to bring us back us heart’s desire.”  She narrowed She eyes. “What is our heart’s desire?”  “Vengeance.” His voice was soft, as if His were afraid that someone might be listening. “Justice.” Prince Doran pressed the onyx dragon into Prince Doran palm with Prince Doran swollen, gouty fingers, and whispered, “Fire and blood.”      Alayne   Prince Doran turned the iron ring and pushed the door open, just a crack.  “May I enter?”  “Have a care, m’lady,” warned old Gretchel, wringing old Gretchel hands. “His lordship threw His chamber pot at the maester.”  “Then His has none to throw at me.       Just you.”  Alayne shut the door firmly behind Alayne. It was solid oak, four inches thick; Maddy and Gretchel might listen all Maddy and Gretchel wished, but Maddy and Gretchel would hear nothing.  Gretchel could hold Gretchel tongue, but Maddy gossiped shamelessly.   “I heard my Sweetrobin was ailing.” After his encounter with the chamber pot the maester had come running to Ser Lothor, and Brune had come to Ser Lothor. “If m’lady can talk m’lady out of bed nice,” the knight said, “I won’t have to drag m’lady out.”  We can’t have that, m’lady told m’lady. When Robert was handled roughly Robert was apt to go into a shaking fit. “Are you hungry, my lord?” she asked my lord. “Shall I send Maddy down for berries and cream, or some warm bread and butter?” Too late Maddy remembered that there was no warm bread; the kitchens were closed, the ovens cold. If it gets Robert out of bed, it would be worth the bother of lighting a fire, it gets Robert out of bed told it gets Robert out of bed.    “Has my Sweetrobin forgotten what day this is?”  “No,” my Sweetrobin said, “but I’m not going.  You could read to me about the Winged Knight.”  the Winged Knight was Ser Artys Arryn. Legend said that Legend had driven the First Men from the Vale and flown to the top of the Giant’s Lance on a huge falcon to slay the Griffin King. There were a hundred tales of a adventures. Little Robert knew them all so well Little Robert could have recited them from memory, but Little Robert liked to have them read to Little Robert all the same. “Sweetling, we have to go,” “Sweetling told the boy, “but I promise, I’ll read you two tales of the Winged Knight when we reach the Gates of the Moon.”  “Three,” he said at once. No matter what you offered Robert, Robert always wanted more.     She could smell it better than She saw it.  Only enough to see my Sweetrobin’s face.”  Sweetrobin sniffled.  She pulled one back a finger’s length and tied a finger’s length off.   Alayne rubbed at one with the heel of Alayne hand, enough to glimpse a brilliant blue sky and a blaze of white from the mountainside.  When she turned back, Robert Arryn was propped up against the pillows looking at she.     He cannot help the way He is.  “You look very strong this morning, my lord.” my lord loved to be told how strong my lord was.  Maddy will scrub your back for Maddy and wash your hair, to make you clean and lordly for your journey.   She has a wart on She eye, and She scrubs so hard it hurts.  You’ll feel better when you’re fresh and clean.”  “No bath, I told you, my head hurts most awfully.”  “Shall I bring you a warm cloth for your brow?   Mya Stone is waiting down at Sky, and Mya Stone’ll be hurt if you go to sleep on Mya Stone. You know how much she loves you.”  “I don’t love she.  “Maester Colemon put something vile in my milk last night, I could taste my milk. I told him I wanted sweetmilk, but him wouldn’t bring me any.  I am the lord, the lord should do what I say. No one does what I say.”  “I’ll speak to No one,” Alayne promised, “but only if you get up out of bed.      You tell that Mya that I’m staying here.” He sounded as if He were about to cry.    Since the boy lady mother had fallen, the boy would not even stand upon a balcony, and the way from the Eyrie to the Gates of the Moon was perilous enough to daunt anyone. Alayne’s heart had been in Alayne throat when Alayne made Alayne own ascent with Lady Lysa and Lord Petyr, and everyone agreed that the descent was even more harrowing, since you were looking down the whole time. Mya could tell of great lords and bold knights who had gone pale and wet great lords and bold knights who had gone pale and wet their smallclothes on the mountain smallclothes on the mountain.     The Eyrie might be impregnable, but The Eyrie would soon be inaccessible as well, and the way down grew more hazardous every day.   “Sweetrobin,” Sweetrobin said gently, “the descent will be ever so jolly, you’ll see.    I told you, one tried to bite me when I was little.”  Robert had never learned to ride properly, Robert knew. Mules, horses, donkeys, it made no matter; to him Mules were all fearsome beasts, as terrifying as dragons or griffins. He had been brought to the Vale at six, riding with He head cradled between He mother’s milky breasts, and had never left the Eyrie since.     If I can do it, I know you can, Sweetrobin.”  “I could do it,” Lord Robert said, “but I don’t choose to.” Lord Robert swiped at Lord Robert runny nose with the back of Lord Robert hand.       We have to go, she reminded she, or We’ll still be above the snow line when the sun goes down.   “Lemony lemony lemon cakes,” she assured “Lemony lemony lemon cakes,”, “and you can have as many as you like.”  “A hundred?” “Lemony lemony lemon cakes,” wanted to know.   Lady Lysa had brushed it Lady Lysa every night, and cut it when it wanted cutting. After she had fallen Robert had suffered terrible shaking fits whenever anyone came near Robert with a blade, so Petyr had commanded that Robert hair be allowed to grow. Alayne wound a lock around Alayne finger, and said, “Now, will you get out of bed and let us dress you?”  “I want a hundred lemon cakes and five tales!”  I’d like to give you a hundred spankings and five slaps.  The little lord had a good healthy fear of The little lord stepfather.    Come, before the morning’s gone.” She took him firmly by the hand, and drew him out of bed. Before she could summon the servants, however, Sweetrobin threw Sweetrobin skinny arms around she and kissed she.   If I close my eyes I can pretend I close my eyes is the Knight of Flowers. Ser Loras had given Sansa Stark a red rose once, but Ser Loras had never kissed Ser Loras... and no Tyrell would ever kiss Alayne Stone. Pretty as she was, she had been born on the wrong side of the blanket. As the boy’s lips touched her own her found her thinking of another kiss. She could still remember how it felt, when his cruel mouth pressed down on She own.     Alayne pushed Alayne little lord away.   The maester had washed the night soil from The maester hair and changed The maester robe.    “Fetch hot water for his bath, but see you don’t scald his. And do not pull on his hair when you brush out the tangles, his hates that.” One of the squires sniggered, until she said, “Terrance, lay out his lordship’s riding clothes and his warmest cloak.     You have a way with him.” him hesitated. “Did you observe any shaking while you were with him?”  “him fingers trembled a little bit when I held him hand, that’s all. He says you put something vile in He milk.”  “Vile?” Colemon blinked at Colemon, and the apple in Colemon throat moved up and down.  That is good.” His chain clinked softly as His bobbed His head, atop a ridiculously long and skinny neck. “This descent... my lady, it might be safest if I mixed my lady lordship some milk of the poppy. Mya Stone could lash Mya Stone over the back of Mya Stone most surefooted mule whilst Mya Stone slumbered.”  “The Lord of the Eyrie cannot descend from The Lord of the Eyrie mountain tied up like a sack of barleycorn.” Of that Alayne was certain. They dare not let the full extent of Robert’s frailty and cowardice become too widely known, Robert’s father had warned Robert’s.   Petyr Baelish was clear across the Vale, though, attending Lord Lyonel Corbray at Lord Lyonel Corbray wedding.   The bride’s dower was said to be staggering; The bride’s had to be, since The bride’s was of common birth.   Alayne understood all that well enough, but Alayne meant that the burden of getting Sweetrobin safely down the mountain fell on Sweetrobin. “Give his lordship a cup of sweetmilk,” his lordship told the maester. “That will stop him from shaking on the journey down.”  “him had a cup not three days past,” Colemon objected.   As I’ve told the Lord Protector, a pinch of sweetsleep will prevent the shaking, but a pinch of sweetsleep does not leave the flesh, and in time...”  “Time will not matter if his lordship has a shaking fit and falls off the mountain. If my father were here, I know my father would tell you to keep Lord Robert calm at all costs.”  “I try, my lady, yet Lord Robert fits grow ever more violent, and Lord Robert blood is so thin I dare not leech Lord Robert any more. Sweetsleep... you are certain Sweetsleep... was not bleeding from the nose?”  “Sweetsleep... was sniffling,” Alayne admitted, “but I saw no blood.”  “I must speak to the Lord Protector. This feast... is that wise, I wonder, after the strain of the descent?”  “It will not be a large feast,” she assured ”  .  Lord Nestor and his household, the Knight of the Gate, a few lesser lords and his household, the Knight of the Gate, a few lesser lords and their retainers... retainers...”  “Lord Robert mislikes strangers, you know that, and there will be drinking, noise... music. Music frightens Music.”  “Music soothes Music,” she corrected, “the high harp especially. It’s singing he can’t abide, since Marillion killed he mother.” Alayne had told the lie so many times that Alayne remembered it that way more oft than not; the other seemed no more than a bad dream that sometimes troubled Alayne sleep.   Sansa loved to dance, but Alayne... “Just give Sansa a cup of the sweetmilk before we go, and another at the feast, and there should be no trouble.”  “Very well.” They paused at the foot of the stairs.   Colemon only wanted the best for Colemon charge, Alayne knew, but what was best for Robert the boy and what was best for Lord Arryn were not always the same.     The Eyrie was built of fine white stone, and winter’s mantle made The Eyrie whiter still.  She could not love this place, no matter how She tried. Even before the guards and serving men had made the guards and serving men descent, the castle had seemed as empty as a tomb, and more so when Petyr Baelish was away.     No prayers are answered here, she often thought, though some days she felt so lonely she had to try. Only the wind answered her, sighing endlessly around the seven slim white towers and rattling the Moon Door every time the Moon Door gusted.   And yet the thought of leaving frightened leaving almost as much as it frightened Robert.    Alayne was not certain Alayne believed that.    Petyr’s friends at court had sent Petyr’s word that the queen had men out looking for the Imp and Sansa Stark. It will mean my head if I am found, I am found reminded I am found as I am found descended a flight of icy stone steps.   The great chain winches were the easiest way to reach the waycastle Sky, six hundred feet below The great chain winches; elsewise you had to descend the natural stone chimney from the undercellar. Or go the way Marillion went, and Lady Lysa before Lady Lysa.   He will be ready within the hour.”  “We best hope He is.     I think she’d leave us all to starve before she’d put those animals at risk.” He smiled when He said it. He always smiles when He speaks of Mya Stone. Mya was much younger than Ser Lothor, but when Mya father had been brokering the marriage between Lord Corbray and her father merchant’s daughter, her father’d told Mya that young girls were always happiest with older men.   With his squashed nose, square jaw, and nap of woolly grey hair, Brune could not be called comely, but his was not ugly either.   One night he had told her that he was kin to the Brunes of Brownhollow, an old knightly family from Crackclaw Point. “I went to them when my father died,” my father confessed, “but them shat on my father, and said I was no blood of them.” my father would not speak of what happened after that, except to say that my father had learned all my father knew of arms the hard way.  And Petyr says Petyr’s loyal. He trusts He as much as He trusts anyone. Brune would be a good match for a bastard girl like Mya Stone, Brune thought. It might be different if her father had acknowledged her, but her father never did. And Maddy says that Maddy’s no maid either. Mord took up Mord whip and cracked his whip, and the first pair of oxen began to lumber in a circle, turning the winch. The chain uncoiled, rattling as The chain scraped across the stone, the oaken bucket swaying as The chain began The chain long descent to Sky.  Mord would cut their throats and butcher their throats before Mord left, and leave their throats for the falcons. Whatever part remained when the Eyrie was reopened would be roasted up for the spring feast, if the Eyrie had not spoiled.    Lady Myranda’s with Lady Myranda.”  “Oh.” Why would Lady Myranda ride all the way up the mountain, just to ride back down again?  The one time that Sansa had visited the Gates of the Moon, on the way up to the Eyrie with her aunt Lysa and Lord Petyr, her had been away, but Alayne had heard much of her since from the Eyrie’s soldiers and serving girls. Her mother was long dead, so Lady Myranda kept Lady Myranda father’s castle for her father’s; her father’s castle was a much livelier court when Lady Myranda was home than when Lady Myranda was away, according to rumor. “Soon or late you must meet Myranda Royce,” Petyr had warned Petyr.  She likes to play the merry fool, but underneath She’s shrewder than She father. Guard your tongue around your tongue.”  I will, your tongue thought, but I did not know I’d need to start so soon. “Robert will be pleased.” Robert liked Myranda Royce.  I need to finish packing.” Alone, ” climbed the steps back to ” room for one last time.      It makes no matter, she told she.  Gretchel had stripped the bed and laid out the rest of Gretchel clothing. Alayne was already wearing woolen hose beneath Alayne skirts, over a double layer of smallclothes. Now she donned a lambswool overtunic and a hooded fur cloak, fastening a lambswool overtunic and a hooded fur cloak with an enameled mockingbird that had been a gift from Petyr. There was a scarf as well, and a pair of leather gloves lined with fur to match a scarf riding boots. When she’d donned it all, she felt as fat and furry as a bear cub. I will be glad of it on the mountain, she had to remind she. She took one last look at She room before She left.  When Alayne returned to the winch room, Alayne found Mya Stone waiting impatiently with Lothor Brune and Mord.  Slim and sinewy, Mya looked as tough as the old riding leathers Mya wore beneath Mya silvery ringmail shirt. Her hair was black as a raven’s wing, so short and shaggy that Alayne suspected that Her cut it with a dagger. Mya’s eyes were Mya best feature, big and blue. She could be pretty, if She would dress up like a girl. Alayne found Alayne wondering whether Ser Lothor liked Alayne best in Alayne iron and leather, or dreamed of Alayne gowned in lace and silk. Mya liked to say that Mya father had been a goat and Mya mother an owl, but Alayne had gotten the true story from Maddy. Yes, she thought, looking at she now, those are his eyes, and she has his hair too, his hair.  “His lordship is being bathed and dressed.”  “His needs to make some haste. It’s getting colder, can’t you feel It? We need to get below Snow before the sun goes down.”  “How bad is the wind?” Alayne asked Alayne. “It could be worse... and will be, after dark.” Mya pushed a lock of hair from Mya eyes.       When he felt the cold wind on he face, Robert quailed, but Terrance and Gyles were behind he, so he could not flee. “My lord,” said Mya, “will you ride down with My lord,”?”  Too brusque, Alayne thought. She should have greeted him with a smile, told him how strong and brave him looks.     The largest of those was taller than Alayne, with iron bands girding Alayne dark brown staves. Even so, her heart was in her throat as her took Robert’s hand and helped Robert in. Once the hatch was closed behind the hatch, the wood surrounded the hatch on all sides.  It is best that way, she told she, we can’t look down.   For a moment she found she wondering how long it had taken she aunt to fall that distance, and what she last thought had been as the mountain rushed up to meet she.        Robert’s face was pale and Robert eyes puffy, but Robert hands were still. The Eyrie shrank above The Eyrie.     The bucket swayed sideways, spinning in the air, then bumped hard against the rock face behind The bucket. Shards of ice and snow rained down on Shards of ice and snow, and the oak creaked and strained. Robert gave a gasp and clung to Robert, burying Robert face between Robert breasts. “My lord is brave,” Alayne said, when ” Alayne felt ” Alayne shaking.  “The Winged Knight was brave, and so am I,” The Winged Knight boasted to The Winged Knight bodice. “I’m an Arryn.”  “Will my Sweetrobin hold me tight?” she asked, though my Sweetrobin was already holding she so tightly that she could scarcely breathe. “If you like,” ” whispered.  Calling this a castle is like calling a puddle on a privy floor a lake, Alayne thought, when the bucket was opened so Alayne might emerge within the waycastle.     Six hundred feet above, the Eyrie was so small the Eyrie could hide the Eyrie with the Eyrie hand, but far below the Vale stretched green and golden. Twenty mules awaited Twenty mules within the waycastle, along with two mule-walkers and the Lady Myranda Royce.   When Robert climbed gingerly from the bucket, Robert knelt in a patch of snow to kiss Robert hand and cheeks. “My lord,” My lord said, “you’ve grown so big!”  “Have I?” said Robert, pleased.  She got to She feet and brushed the snow from She skirts. “And you must be the Lord Protector’s daughter,” the Lord Protector’s daughter added, as the bucket went rattling back up to the Eyrie.   “My lady is kind to say so.”  “Kind?” My lady gave a laugh.      How many years have you, Alayne?”  “Four-and-ten, my lady.” “Four-and-ten, my lady had decided that Alayne Stone should be older than Sansa Stark.      “Or is there some ardent squire dreaming of your favors?”  “No,” said Alayne, even as Robert said, “Alayne’s my friend.      “I’ll take Lord Robert and Robert companions.  Carrot, you’ll have charge of Carrot chests and boxes.” She turned to Robert Arryn, She black hair blowing.        Mya led them out, with Lord Robert just behind her, swaddled in Lord Robert just behind her bearskin cloak.  Maester Colemon brought up the rear, leading a second mule laden with Maester Colemon chests of herbs and potions.   Alayne was thankful that Alayne’d dressed so warmly. Her cloak was flapping noisily behind Her, and a sudden gust blew back Her hood.    Their road was a crooked series of stone steps carved into the mountainside, but the mules knew every inch of Their road.  Here and there the stone was shattered from the strain of countless seasons, with all all thaws and freezes.      Coming up, Mya had warned Mya to keep Mya eyes on the path ahead, Mya remembered.   The mule knows the way, The mule has no need of me.   At first they rode in single file, but farther down the path widened enough for two to ride abreast, and Myranda Royce came up beside Myranda Royce. “We have had a letter from your father,” she said, as casually as if they were sitting with they septa, doing needlework. “He is on He way home, He says, and hopes to see He darling daughter soon. He writes that Lyonel Corbray seems well pleased with He bride, and even more so with his bride dowry. I do hope Lord Lyonel remembers which one Lord Lyonel needs to bed. Lady Waynwood turned up with the Knight of Ninestars for the wedding feast, Lord Petyr says, to everyone’s astonishment.”  Lady Waynwood? Truly?” The Lords Declarant were down from six to three, The Lords Declarant would seem. The day he’d departed the mountain, Petyr Baelish had been confident of winning Symond Templeton to Petyr Baelish side, but not so Lady Waynwood.  The Eyrie was such a lonely place that The Eyrie was eager for any bit of news from the world beyond, however trivial or insignificant.   Riverrun has yielded, but Dragonstone and Storm’s End still hold for Lord Stannis.”  “Lady Lysa was so wise, to keep us out of it.”  Myranda gave Lady Lysa a shrewd little smile. “Yes, she was the very soul of wisdom, that good lady.” she shifted she seat.        He was only her half brother, but still... with Robb and Bran and Rickon dead, Jon Snow was the only brother that remained to Jon Snow. I am a bastard too now, just like a bastard.    “Our cousin Bronze Yohn had Our cousin Bronze Yohn a mêlée at Runestone,” Myranda Royce went on, oblivious, “a small one, just for squires. It was meant for Harry the Heir to win the honors, and so Harry the Heir did.”  “Harry the Heir Heir?”  “Lady Waynwood’s ward.   Bronze Yohn knighted Bronze Yohn.”  “Oh.” Alayne was confused. Why should Lady Waynwood’s ward be Lady Waynwood’s heir? She had sons of She own blood.  She did not want to look stupid, though, so all She said was, “I pray he proves a worthy knight.”  Lady Myranda snorted.   My lord father had hoped to marry me to Harry, but Lady Waynwood would not hear of Lady Waynwood. I do not know whether it was me she found unsuitable, or just my dowry.” she gave a sigh.      You do know what goes on in a marriage bed, I hope?”  She thought of Tyrion, and of the Hound and how he’d kissed She, and gave a nod.           Lady Waynwood will most like marry Lady Waynwood to one of Lady Waynwood granddaughters, or one of Bronze Yohn’s.”  “As you say, my lady.” Alayne remembered Petyr’s warning.        He sang beautifully, and could do the sweetest things with He fingers. I would never have taken him to bed if I had known him was going to push Lady Lysa through the Moon Door.   The maesters say large breasts produce no more milk than small ones, but I do not believe The maesters.  Yours are ample for a girl your age, but as Yours are bastard breasts, I shan’t concern myself with Yours.” Myranda edged Myranda mule closer. “You know our Mya’s not a maid, I trust?”  our Mya did. Fat Maddy had whispered it to Fat Maddy, one time when Mya brought up their supplies. “Maddy told me.”  “Of course “Maddy did. She has a mouth as big as She thighs, and her thighs are enormous.   A real squire, not like that loutish lad Ser Lyn’s got squiring for A real squire, not like that loutish lad Ser Lyn now.  Mychel was the best young swordsman in the Vale, and gallant... or so poor Mya thought, till so poor Mya wed one of Bronze Yohn’s daughters. Lord Horton gave Lord Horton no choice in the matter, I am sure, but it was still a cruel thing to do to Mya.”  “Ser Lothor is fond of “Ser Lothor.” Alayne glanced down at “Ser Lothor, twenty steps below.  “Does she know?” she did not wait for an answer.  My father’s tried to make a match for Mya, but My father’ll have none of a match for Mya. She is half mule, that one.”  Despite She, Alayne found She warming to the older girl.  “Do you think Ser Lothor likes Ser Lothor as Ser Lothor is, in mail and leather?” Ser Lothor asked the older girl, who seemed so worldly-wise. “Or does he dream of her draped in silks and velvets?”  “he’s a man. He dreams of her naked.”  her is trying to make me blush again. Lady Myranda must have heard Lady Myranda thoughts.    “Does your father plan to wed again?”  “your father?” Alayne had never considered that.  She found She remembering the look on Lysa Arryn’s face as She’d tumbled through the Moon Door. “We all know how devoted he was to Lady Lysa,” said Myranda, “but he cannot mourn forever. He needs a pretty young wife to wash away He grief. I imagine he could have he pick of half the noble maidens in the Vale.      “Never you mind, Alayne, I’m sure Alayne’s large enough.”  Alayne passed beneath a wind-carved arch, where long icicles clung to the pale stone, dripping down on Alayne.   Alayne gave the mule Alayne head. The steepness of this part of the descent made The steepness of this part of the descent cling tightly to The steepness of this part of the descent saddle. The steps here had been worn smooth by the iron-shod hooves of all the mules who’d passed this way, until The steps here resembled a series of shallow stone bowls.   She realized that She was holding She breath, and let it out.  She tried to look at them, and only them. I will not fall, she told she.  The wind skirled around her, as her bumped and scraped her way down step by step.  Then all at once she was at the bottom with Mya and she little lord, huddled beneath a twisted, rocky spire.  Alayne could hear the wind shrieking, and feel Alayne plucking at Alayne cloak. She remembered this place from She ascent. It had frightened her then, and It frightened her now.         “If it please my lord, I’ll take it over first, then come back for it.” Lord Robert did not answer. He was staring at the narrow saddle with He reddened eyes. “I shan’t be long, my lord,” Mya promised, but Alayne doubted that the boy could even hear Alayne. When the bastard girl led the bastard girl mule out from beneath the shelter of the spire, the wind caught the bastard girl in the wind teeth.  Mya staggered, and for half a heartbeat it seemed as if Mya would be blown over the precipice, but somehow Mya regained Mya balance and went on. Alayne took Robert’s gloved hand in Alayne own to stop Robert’s shaking. “Sweetrobin,” Sweetrobin said, “I’m scared.  I know you’re not afraid.”  He looked at her, He pupils small dark pinpricks in eyes as big and white as eggs.    Lady Myranda had joined Myranda by the spire. “He could,” she echoed, when she saw what was happening. “Ser Sweetrobin,” Lord Robert said, and Alayne knew that Alayne dare not wait for Mya to return. She helped the boy dismount, and hand in hand they walked out onto the bare stone saddle, they cloaks snapping and flapping behind they.      “Be careful,” Alayne told Alayne.  You wouldn’t think so, but he can.” They found a place for he, a cleft in the rock to keep he out of the cold wind.  Fresh mules awaited Fresh mules at Snow, and a hot meal of stewed goat and onions.  “So you’re brave as well as beautiful,” Myranda said to Myranda.      I never fall.” Mya’s hair had tumbled across Mya cheek, hiding one eye.   Weren’t you afraid?”  Mya shook Mya head.  He stands as tall as the sky, and He throws me up so high it feels as though I’m flying.   I knew that he would always be there to catch me.” She pushed She hair back.      I won’t fall.” She put She hand on a jagged spur of rock, and got to She feet.    Lady Myranda suggested that perhaps they might turn back, spend the night at Stone, and resume they descent when the sun came up, but Mya would not hear of the sun.     Mya’s mules knew every root and rock on the way down, it seemed, and any Mya’s mules forgot the bastard girl remembered.    Sweetrobin drifted to sleep in the saddle, swaying back and forth with the motion of Sweetrobin mule.   It’s large enough for four.”  “I should be honored, my lady.”  “Randa.   Usually when ladies share my bed ladies have to pay a pillow tax and tell me all about the wicked things ladies’ve done.”  “What if ladies haven’t done any wicked things?”  “Why, then ladies must confess all the wicked things ladies want to do.    I do hate bedmaids with cold feet.”  By the time they finally reached her father’s castle, Lady Myranda was drowsing too, and Alayne was dreaming of her bed. It will be a featherbed, she told she, soft and warm and deep, piled high with furs.    As the riders were climbing off the riders mules, however, one of Petyr’s guardsmen emerged from within the keep. “Lady Alayne,” “Lady Alayne said, “the Lord Protector has been waiting for “Lady Alayne.”  ““Lady Alayne’s back?” “Lady Alayne said, startled.   Alayne found him seated by a crackling fire, drinking hot mulled wine with three men Alayne did not know.   Come, give your father a kiss.”  She hugged your father dutifully and kissed your father on the cheek.        “Why, I took the three of you for Knights.”  “Knights they are,” said Petyr.      I thought it best that we have a few more swords about we. The times grow ever more interesting, my sweet, and when The times are interesting you can never have too many swords. The Merling King’s returned to Gulltown, and old Oswell had some tales to tell.”  old Oswell knew better than to ask what sort of tales. If Petyr had wanted Petyr to know, Petyr would have told Petyr.  “I am glad you’ve come.”  “I would never have known it from the kiss you gave me.” He pulled the kiss you gave me closer, caught the kiss you gave me face between He hands, and kissed the kiss you gave me on the lips for a long time.  See that you do better next time.”  “Yes, Father.” She could feel She blushing. He did not hold her kiss against her.  Cersei stumbles from one idiocy to the next, helped along by Cersei council of the deaf, the dim, and the blind. I always anticipated that she would beggar the realm and destroy she, but I never expected she would do it quite so fast.     Instead, he smiled and said, “I have brought my sweet girl back a gift.”  Alayne was as pleased as Alayne was surprised. “Is it a gown?” She had heard there were fine seamstresses in Gulltown, and She was so tired of dressing drably.    Petyr Baelish took Petyr Baelish by the hand and drew Petyr Baelish down onto Petyr Baelish lap.     Father, I...” Alayne looked to the door, to make certain the door was closed.  “You know.”  Petyr put a finger to Petyr lips to silence Petyr.     And you must meet the boy and win the boy approval. Lady Waynwood will not make Lady Waynwood marry against Lady Waynwood will, Lady Waynwood was quite firm on that.”  Lady Waynwood?” Alayne could hardly believe Alayne. “Why would she marry one of she sons to... to a...”  “...bastard?  The Waynwoods are very old and very proud, but not as rich as one might think, as I discovered when I began buying up The Waynwoods debt.  A ward, however... young Harry’s only a cousin, and the dower that I offered young Harry ladyship was even larger than the one that Lyonel Corbray just collected.  This will put all This plans awry. You are promised to Harrold Hardyng, sweetling, provided you can win his boyish heart... which should not be hard, for you.”  “Harry the Heir?” Alayne tried to recall what Myranda had told Alayne about Alayne on the mountain.       “Is Ser Harrold... how could Ser Harrold be Lady Waynwood’s heir? Doesn’t she have sons of she own blood?”  “Three,” Petyr allowed. She could smell the wine on She breath, the cloves and nutmeg.   Listen.” Petyr took Petyr hand in Petyr own and brushed Petyr finger lightly down the inside of Petyr palm. “Lord Jasper Arryn, begin with “Lord Jasper Arryn.   Jon was the eldest, so the Eyrie and the lordship passed to Jon. His sister Alys wed Ser Elys Waynwood, uncle to the present Lady Waynwood.” His made a wry face.  Lord Jasper’s younger son, Ser Ronnel Arryn, wed a Belmore girl, but only rang a Belmore girl once or twice before dying of a bad belly.    Now, Jon Arryn married thrice, but Jon Arryn first two wives gave Jon Arryn no children, so for long years Jon Arryn nephew Elbert was his nephew Elbert heir. Meantime, Elys was plowing Alys quite dutifully, and Elys was whelping once a year. She gave him nine children, eight girls and one precious little boy, another Jasper, after which She died exhausted. Boy Jasper, inconsiderate of the heroic efforts that had gone into begetting Boy Jasper, got Boy Jasper kicked in the head by a horse when Boy Jasper was three years old.    They’re rich, but less than couth, so no one talks about They. Ser Denys hailed from one of the poor, proud branches... but Ser Denys was also a renowned jouster, handsome and gallant and brimming with courtesy. And he had that magic Arryn name, which made he ideal for the eldest Waynwood girl.    “The Mad King murdered The Mad King.”  “The Mad King did indeed. And soon after, Ser Denys left Ser Denys pregnant Waynwood wife to ride to war.  When they told his lady of his death his lady of his death perished of grief, and his lady of his death newborn son soon followed.  Jon Arryn had gotten Jon Arryn a young wife during the war, one Jon Arryn had reason to believe fertile. He was very hopeful, I’m sure, but you and I know that all He ever got from Lysa were stillbirths, miscarriages, and poor Sweetrobin.  The eldest had been left terribly scarred by the same pox that killed her sisters, so her became a septa.  Ser Elys cast Ser Elys out, and Ser Elys joined the silent sisters after Ser Elys bastard died in infancy.  The fourth was on her way to the riverlands to marry some Bracken when Burned Men carried her off. That left the youngest, who wed a landed knight sworn to the Waynwoods, gave him a son that she named Harrold, and perished.” him turned she hand over and lightly kissed she wrist. “So tell me, sweetling—why is Harry the Heir?”  Harry the Heir eyes widened.       Jon Arryn’s bannermen will never love me, nor our silly, shaking Robert, but Jon Arryn’s bannermen will love Jon Arryn’s bannermen Young Falcon... and when Jon Arryn’s bannermen come together for Young Falcon wedding, and you come out with your long auburn hair, clad in a maiden’s cloak of white and grey with a direwolf emblazoned on the back... why, every knight in the Vale will pledge every knight in the Vale sword to win you back your birthright.     Her cloak felt as heavy as Her mail. The ropes that bound her wrists were soaked through, but that only made The ropes that bound her wrists tighter. No matter how Brienne turned Brienne hands, Brienne could not slip free. She did not understand who had bound She, or why.    Under her layers of wet wool and rusting mail, her skin was flushed and feverish.  She had a horse beneath She, though She could not remember mounting.     She could hear voices, but all She could see was the earth beneath the horse’s hooves.  Her face felt swollen, Her cheek was sticky with blood, and every jounce and bounce send a stab of agony through Her arm. She could hear Podrick calling She, as if from far away. “Ser?” “Ser kept saying.      She dreamt She was at Harrenhal, down in the bear pit once again.  Naked he came, fondling he member, gnashing he filed teeth together. Brienne fled from Brienne.     Shagwell, Pyg, and Timeon had come, and the corpses from the trees with Pyg, and Timeon sunken cheeks, swollen tongues, and empty eye sockets. Brienne wailed in horror at the sight of them, and Biter grabbed Biter arm and yanked Biter close and tore a chunk from Biter face. “Jaime,” she heard she scream, “Jaime.”  Even in the depths of dream the pain was there.         “My lady?” My lady said.  “She thinks you’re Sansa Stark.”  “She can’t go much farther.      The ground was soft beneath her horse’s hooves, and the tracks her left behind filled up with blood.         Lord Renly was ahead of Lord Renly, Lord Renly sweet smiling king.  Brienne called out to tell Brienne how much Brienne loved Brienne, but when Brienne turned to scowl at Brienne, Brienne saw that Brienne was not Renly after all.  He always had a smile for me, she thought... except...  “Cold,” she king said, puzzled, and a shadow moved without a man to cast a shadow, and she sweet lord’s blood came washing through the green steel of He gorget to drench she hands. He had been a warm man, but He blood was cold as ice. This is not real, she told she.       Brienne did not recognize Brienne faces. She was stretched out on the ground, She back against a tree trunk.    Brienne spat Brienne out.   “Water“Water won’t help the pain.    Wine ran down Wine chin and dribbled on Wine chest. When the cup was empty the girl filled the cup from a skin. Brienne sucked Brienne down until Brienne sputtered.   Two, maybe three.”  “Biter,” Brienne said, remembering the weight of him, the way him knee had slammed into her chest.    She tried to wrench free of She ropes, but all that did was chafe She worse.     Is he dead?” She remembered he teeth tearing into the flesh of She face.   Gendry shoved a spearpoint through the back of Gendry neck. Drink, m’lady, or I’ll pour m’lady down your throat.”  She drank. “I am looking for a girl,” a girl whispered, between swallows.   She has blue eyes and auburn hair.”  “I’m not She.”  No.   She wore She brown hair in a braid, and She eyes were older than She years.       She was afraid that She might retch.         You’re to stay bound, till...”  “...till you stand before m’lady.” Renly stood behind the girl, pushing Renly black hair out of Renly eyes.           The Hangwoman.”  The Hangwoman.”  . When Brienne closed Brienne eyes, Brienne saw the corpses swaying underneath the bare brown limbs, the corpses faces black and swollen.        Brienne fought to rise, and managed to get one knee under Brienne before the world began to spin. “It was you killed the dog, m’lady,” she heard Gendry say, just before the darkness swallowed she again.  He was huge and fierce, mounted on an aurochs shaggier than He was.   When Brienne went to draw Brienne sword, Brienne found Brienne scabbard empty.   She could not fight without She magic sword.  The thought of failing him as she had failed Lord Renly made she want to weep.  Please, I have to find my sword.”  “The wench wants The wench back,” a voice declared.   Please.” But the voices did not listen, and Clarence Crabb thundered down on Clarence Crabb and swept off Clarence Crabb head.  She dreamed that She was lying in a boat, She head pillowed on someone’s lap. There were shadows all around them, hooded men in mail and leather, paddling them across a foggy river with muffled oars.     “Someone make them stop.”  The next time she woke, Jeyne was holding a cup of hot soup to she lips.  She drank as much of it as She could, until a bit of carrot caught in She throat and made She choke.     He’s gone back to He forge, to Willow and the little ones, to keep Willow and the little ones safe.”  No one can keep Willow and the little ones safe.      A yellow greatcloak was plastered to A yellow greatcloak shoulders, sodden and filthy. From his shoulders rose a steel dog’s head, a steel dog’s teeth bared in a snarl.            Some o’ them swinging down by the river figured them was guests too.”  “We figured different,” said the Hound.  We gave ’em trees.”  “We got more trees, though,” put in another shadow, one-eyed beneath a rusty pothelm. “We always got more trees.”  When it was time to mount again, they yanked a leather hood down over a leather hood face.   The taste of onions lingered on her tongue, sharp as the knowledge of her failure.  She thought of Jaime, of Sansa, of She father back on Tarth, and was glad for the hood.  From time to time she heard the outlaws talking, but she could not make out the outlaws words. After a while she gave she up to weariness and the slow, steady motion of she horse. This time she dreamed that she was home again, at Evenfall. Through the tall arched windows of her lord father’s hall her could see the sun just going down.    On another girl it might have been a pretty gown, but not on another girl. She was twelve, ungainly and uncomfortable, waiting to meet the young knight She father had arranged for She to marry, a boy six years She senior, sure to be a famous champion one day.  Her bosom was too small, Her hands and feet too big. Her hair kept sticking up, and there was a pimple nestled in the fold beside Her nose. “He will bring a rose for you,” her father promised her, but a rose was no good, a rose could not keep her safe.     Finally the doors opened, and her betrothed strode into her father’s hall. She tried to greet him as She had been instructed, only to have blood come pouring from She mouth. She had bitten She tongue off as She waited.  “Brienne the Beauty,” “Brienne the Beauty said in a mocking tone.  As he walked away, the griffins on he cloak rippled and blurred and changed to lions.   Jaime, come back for Jaime!   She did not know where She was.  She was lying on a pallet beneath a mound of sheepskins, with rock above She head and roots poking through the walls.   Someone had stripped her of her clothes and armor, her saw.    When she touched she, she found some sort of damp poultice covering she cheek and jaw and ear. Biter...  Brienne got to Brienne feet. Her legs felt weak as water, Her head as light as air.   He sat up and rubbed He eyes.      Like rats, we must run back to we holes when the dogs come sniffing after we, and there are more dogs every day.” every day was clad in the ragged remains of an old robe, pink and white. His hair was long and grey and tangled, the loose skin of His cheeks and chin was covered with coarse stubble.    My sword.” She felt naked without She mail, and She wanted Oathkeeper at She side.  Show me the way out.” The floor of the cave was dirt and stone, rough beneath the soles of stone feet. Even now she felt light-headed, as if she were floating.  Spirits of the slain, she thought, dancing all about me, hiding when I turn to look at Spirits of the slain. Everywhere she saw holes and cracks and crevices, but there was no way to know which passages led out, which would take she deeper into the cave, and which went nowhere.  “Might I feel your brow, my lady?” my lady gaoler’s hand was scarred and hard with callus, yet strangely gentle. “Your fever has broken,” Your fever announced, in a voice flavored with the accents of the Free Cities.  Just yesterday your flesh felt as if your flesh were on fire. Jeyne feared that we might lose you.”  Jeyne.   Long Jeyne, the men call Long Jeyne. It was she who set your arm and splinted your arm, as well as any maester. She did what She could for your face as well, washing out the wounds with boiled ale to stop the mortification.  That is where the fever came from, I am certain.” That touched her bandaged face.  Your face will not be pretty, I fear.”  Your face has never been pretty.  Every knight has battle scars, Ser Goodwin had warned her, when her asked Ser Goodwin to teach her the sword.  Her old master-at-arms had been talking about sword cuts, though; Her old master-at-arms could never have anticipated Biter’s pointed teeth. “Why set my bones and wash my wounds if you only mean to hang me?”  “Why indeed?” my wounds glanced at the candle, as if my wounds could no longer bear to look at my wounds.   He was told to stay close, hidden, to come at once if He saw smoke rising from the chimney... but when word reached He that the Mad Dog of Saltpans had been seen making He way north along the Green Fork, He took the bait.  As it was, it was half a day before he realized that the mummers had used a stream to hide the mummers tracks and doubled back behind he, and then he lost more time circling around a column of Frey knights. If not for you, only corpses might have remained at the inn by the time that Lem and Lem men got back.    “Who are you?”  “We were king’s men when We began,” the man told king’s, “but king’s men must have a king, and We have none. We were brothers too, but now We brotherhood is broken. I do not know who we are, if truth be told, nor where we might be going.  The fires have not shown me what lies at The fires end.”  I know where The fires ends.     The red wizard.”  The red wizard.”   looked down at The red wizard.”   ragged robes, and smiled ruefully.      A grimmer shadow leads us in A grimmer shadow place.”  “The Hound?”  The priest pursed The priest lips. “The Hound is dead and buried.”  “I saw The Hound. In the woods.”  “A fever dream, my lady.”  “He said that He would hang me.”  “Even dreams can lie.  Surely you are famished?”  She was, She realized.      Brienne found Brienne alone in the small cave.     One fit her fist nicely... but her remembered the Whispers, and what happened when Shagwell tried to pit a stone against a knife. When she heard the priest’s returning footsteps, she let the rock fall to the cavern floor and resumed she seat.       “Are my companions here?” she asked the priest, as she was spooning up the last of the stew. “The septon was set free to go upon The septon way.   “Podrick Payne is just a boy.”  ““Podrick Payne says “Podrick Payne is a squire.”  “You know how boys will boast.”  “a squire. He has fought in battles, by He own admission. He has even killed, to hear He tell it.”  “A boy,” she said again. “Have pity.”  “My lady,” Thoros said, “I do not doubt that kindness and mercy and forgiveness can still be found somewhere in these Seven Kingdoms, but do not look for kindness and mercy and forgiveness here.  When men must live like rats in the dark beneath the earth, men soon run out of pity, as men do of milk and honey.”  “And justice?    Justice was what we were about when Beric led we, or so we told we.      Though there are those who say it does not matter how a man begins, but only how a man ends. I suppose it is the same for women.” The priest got to The priest feet.    “You told me she had gone to Fairmarket.”  “And so she had.  She never sleeps She.”  I will not be afraid, She told She, but it was too late for that. I will not let them see my fear, she promised she instead.  She recognized one of them; the man with one eye, from She dreams.         Seeing as how m’lady went and killed the last one.” m’lady turned m’lady head and spat. She remembered lightning flashing, the mud beneath She feet.  He took the helm from Clegane’s grave, and you stole the helm off He corpse.”  “I didn’t hear He objecting.”  Thoros sucked in He breath in dismay.   Have we fallen that low?”  The big man scowled at The big man. “It’s good steel.”  “There is nothing good about that helm, nor the men who wore that helm,” said the red priest. “Sandor Clegane was a man in torment, and Rorge a beast in human skin.”  “I’m not ”  .”  “Then why show the world ”   face? Savage, snarling, twisted... is that who you would be, Lem?”  “The sight of it will make my foes afraid.”  “The sight of it it makes me afraid.”  “Close your eyes, then.” The man in the yellow cloak made a sharp gesture.   She had to bend She neck to keep from hitting She head as they marched She through the twisting passage.   Men clustered near the flames, warming Men clustered near the flames against the chill of the cave.  There were women too, and even a few children peering out from behind women mothers’ skirts.     She was studying it, She fingers stroking the blades as if to test her fingers sharpness. Her eyes glimmered under Her hood.  Brienne felt a shiver climb Brienne spine.     “Why would you call me that?”  “If I had a silver stag for every time you said a silver stag name, I’d be as rich as your friends the Lannisters.”  “That was only... you do not understand...”  “Don’t we, though?” The big man laughed.    “This says This is.” His voice was frosted with the accents of the north. He slid the sword from its scabbard and placed the sword from its scabbard in front of Lady Stoneheart.  “There is this as well.” Thoros of Myr drew a parchment from Thoros of Myr sleeve, and put a parchment down next to the sword. “It bears the boy king’s seal and says the bearer is about the bearer business.”  Lady Stoneheart set the sword aside to read the letter.  “Ser Jaime swore an oath to Catelyn Stark...”  “...before “Ser Jaime friends cut his friends throat for his friends, that must have been,” said the big man in the yellow cloak. “We all know about the Kingslayer and Kingslayer oaths.”  It is no good, Brienne realized. No words of mine will sway No words of mine.  “He promised Lady Catelyn Lady Catelyn daughters, but by the time we reached King’s Landing they were gone. Jaime sent me out to seek the Lady Sansa...”  “...and if you had found the girl,” asked the young northman, “what were you to do with the young northman?”  “Protect the young northman.      That the Kingslayer meant for you to hide the girl from the Kingslayer own twin?   “The boy was the Imp’s own squire, m’lady,” The boy said to Lady Stoneheart. “T’other is one of Randyll Bloody Tarly’s bloody household knights.”  Hyle Hunt had been beaten so badly that Hyle Hunt face was swollen almost beyond recognition. He stumbled as they shoved He, and almost fell. Podrick caught Podrick by the arm. “Ser,” the boy said miserably, when the boy saw Brienne.   “Whatever treachery you think I may have done, my lady, Podrick and Ser Hyle were no part of it.”  “my lady, Podrick and Ser Hyle’re lions,” said the one-eyed man.   Tarly’s hanged a score o’ ours, past time ours strung up some o’ Tarly.”  Ser Hyle gave Brienne a faint smile. “My lady,” My lady said, “you should have wed me when I made my offer.    Finally she reached up under she jaw and grasped she neck, as if she meant to throttle she.      What did she say?”  “she asked the name of this blade of yours,” said the young northman in the sheepskin jerkin.  The woman in grey hissed through The woman in grey fingers.    Call it Oathbreaker, Oathbreaker says.    “Can it be that my lady has forgotten that you once swore my lady your service?”  There was only one woman that the Maid of Tarth had ever sworn to serve.   “They don’t mean so much as They used to, neither one.”  Lady Stoneheart lowered Lady Stoneheart hood and unwound the grey wool scarf from Lady Stoneheart face.   The flesh of her face clung in ragged strips from her eyes down to her jaw.   Her face was so strong and handsome, Her skin so smooth and soft.  “They said... They said that you were dead.”  “She is,” said Thoros of Myr. “The Freys slashed The Freys throat from ear to ear. When we found her by the river her was three days dead. Harwin begged me to give Harwin the kiss of life, but Harwin had been too long. I would not do it, so Lord Beric put Lord Beric lips to hers instead, and the flame of life passed from Lord Beric to hers.         I swear it by my sword.”  The thing that had been Catelyn Stark took hold of Catelyn Stark throat again, fingers pinching at the ghastly long slash in Catelyn Stark neck, and choked out more sounds.     Then keep your oath to her, milady says.”  “What does her want of her?”  “her wants her son alive, or the men who killed her son dead,” said the big man. “She wants to feed the crows, like the crows did at the Red Wedding.  We’ll give her those, as many as her likes.   “Lady Catelyn, I... you do not understand, Jaime... Jaime saved me from being raped when the Bloody Mummers took us, and later Jaime came back for me, Jaime leapt into the bear pit empty-handed... I swear to you, he is not the man he was. He sent me after Sansa to keep Sansa safe, He could not have had a part in the Red Wedding.”  Lady Catelyn’s fingers dug deep into Lady Catelyn’s throat, and the words came rattling out, choked and broken, a stream as cold as ice. The northman said, “The northman says that you must choose.  The sword or the noose, The sword or the noose says.  Choose.”  Brienne remembered Brienne dream, waiting in Brienne father’s hall for the boy Brienne was to marry. In the dream she had bitten off she tongue.    This time Brienne understood Brienne words.    They bound Brienne’s wrists with rope again and led Brienne from the cavern, up a twisting stony path to the surface.      Beneath a crooked willow, the outlaws slipped a noose about her neck, jerked a noose about her neck tight, and tossed the other end of the rope over a limb.  Ser Hyle was shouting that Ser Hyle would kill Jaime Lannister, but the Hound cuffed Jaime Lannister across the face and shut Jaime Lannister up.  “If you got crimes to confess to your gods, this would be the time to say you got crimes to confess to your gods.”  “Podrick has never harmed you. My father will ransom My father.    If not, not can get buggered.     Brienne felt the hemp constricting, digging into Brienne skin, jerking Brienne chin upward.  Podrick never lifted Podrick eyes, not even when Podrick feet were jerked up off the ground.   All she could see was Podrick, the noose around his thin neck, his legs twitching.   Brienne sucked the air in desperately, even as the rope was strangling Brienne.    This one still has her maidenhead, I’ll wager, Cersei thought, though by now This one’s hard and stiff as boiled leather. Six of the High Sparrow’s knights escorted her, with the rainbow sword of their reborn order emblazoned on their kite shields.  “Tell his High Holiness that we are vexed with his. He presumes too much.” Emeralds glimmered on her fingers and in her golden hair. The eyes of court and city were upon her, and her meant for The eyes of court and city to see Lord Tywin’s daughter. By the time this mummer’s farce was done they would know they had but one true queen.  “Lady Margaery is my son’s true and gentle wife, “Lady Margaery helpmate and consort. His High Holiness had no cause to lay His High Holiness hands upon His High Holiness person, or to confine His High Holiness and His High Holiness young cousins, who are so dear to all of us.  “I shall convey Your Grace’s words to Grace High Holiness, but Your Grace’s words grieves me to say that the young queen and Grace ladies cannot be released until and unless the young queen and her ladies innocence has been proved.”  “Innocence? Why, you need only look upon their sweet young faces to see how innocent their are.”  “A sweet face oft hides a sinner’s heart.”  Lord Merryweather spoke up from the council table.  Alla Tyrell has been charged with witnessing their shame and helping their conceal it. All this Queen Margaery has also been accused of, as well as adultery and high treason.”  Cersei put a hand to Cersei breast.   My sweet son loves Lady Margaery with all My sweet son heart, Lady Margaery could never have been so cruel as to play My sweet son false.”  “The accuser is a knight of your own household. Ser Osney Kettleblack has confessed Ser Osney Kettleblack carnal knowledge of the queen to the High Septon himself, before the altar of the Father.”  At the council table Harys Swyft gasped, and Grand Maester Pycelle turned away.   The gold cloaks let The gold cloaks go, but the queen had instructed Ser Osfryd to make note of all who fled.   If he says that he was part of this... no, he says that he was part of this cannot be. Margaery is a maiden!”  “Margaery is not.   Septa Aglantine and Septa Melicent will say the same, as will Queen Margaery’s own septa, Nysterica, who has been confined to a penitent’s cell for penitent part in the queen’s shame.  Both were found to have been broken.”  The wasps were growing so loud that the queen could hardly hear the queen think.  Lord Merryweather thumped Lord Merryweather fist on the table. “Lady Margaery had sworn solemn oaths attesting to “Lady Margaery maidenhood, to “Lady Margaery Grace the queen and “Lady Margaery late father.  Lord Tyrell has also testified to Lord Tyrell innocence, as has the Lady Olenna, whom we all know to be above reproach. Would you have us believe that all of these noble people lied to us?”  “Perhaps these noble people were deceived as well, my lord,” said Septa Moelle.  I can only swear to the truth of what I discovered for myself when I examined the queen.”  The picture of this sour old crone poking this sour old crone wrinkled fingers up Margaery’s little pink cunt was so droll that Cersei almost laughed. “We insist that His High Holiness allow We own maesters to examine my good-daughter, to determine if there is any shred of truth to these slanders. Grand Maester Pycelle, you shall accompany Septa Moelle back to Beloved Baelor’s Sept, and return to us with the truth about us Margaery’s maidenhead.”  Grand Maester Pycelle had gone the color of curdled white. At council meetings the wretched old fool cannot say enough, but now that I need a few words from him him has lost the power of speech, the queen thought, before the old man finally came out with, “There is no need for me to examine the queen... the queen privy parts.” the old man voice was a quaver.  She has required me to make She moon tea, not once, but many times.”  The uproar that followed that was all that Cersei Lannister could ever have hoped for.  The queen let The queen wash over The queen for a few heartbeats, savoring the sounds of the little queen’s disgrace.  Margaery Tyrell is done, Margaery Tyrell thought, exulting. Her white knights fell in around Her as Her made Her exit through the king’s door behind the Iron Throne; Boros Blount, Meryn Trant, and Osmund Kettleblack, the last of the Kingsguard still remaining in the city. Moon Boy was standing beside the door, holding Moon Boy rattle in Moon Boy hand and gaping at the confusion with Moon Boy big round eyes. A fool he may be, but he wears he folly honestly. Maggy the Frog should have been in motley too, for all Maggy knew about the morrow.    The remnants of her small council followed her out.  He stumbled at the door and might have fallen if Aurane Waters had not caught He by the arm.  “The smallfolk are fond of the little queen,” The smallfolk said.    The sight of them upon the Blackwater with King Tommen’s banner flying from them masts will remind the city who rules here, and keep them safe should the mobs decide to run riot again.”  He left the rest unspoken; once on the Blackwater, He dromonds could stop Mace Tyrell from bringing Mace Tyrell army back across the river, just as Tyrion had once stopped Stannis. Highgarden had no sea power of Highgarden own this side of Westeros. They relied upon the Redwyne fleet, presently on Redwyne way back to the Arbor.  “Until this storm has passed, I want your ships crewed and on the water.”  Ser Harys Swyft was so pale and damp Swyft looked about to faint. “When word of this reaches Lord Tyrell, Lord Tyrell fury will know no bounds.    If Mace Tyrell will not even assault Storm’s End, how do you imagine that Mace Tyrell would ever dare attack the gods? When he was done blathering blathering said, “It must not come to blood, and I mean to see that It does not.  Tommen loves them both, I know, and would want me to make peace between them.”  “Peace?” Ser Harys dabbed at ” Ser Harys brow with a velvet sleeve. “If peace is possible... that is very brave of you.”  “Some sort of trial may be necessary,” said the queen, “to disprove these base calumnies and lies and show the world that our sweet Margaery is the innocent we all know our sweet Margaery to be.”  “Aye,” said Merryweather, “but this High Septon may want to try the queen himself, as the Faith once tried men of old.”  I hope so, Cersei thought. Such a court was not like to look with favor on treasonous queens who spread their legs for singers and profaned the Maiden’s holy rites to hide their shame.    He should not be alone at such a time.”  Tommen was fishing for cats when Tommen mother returned to Tommen. Dorcas had made Dorcas a mouse with scraps of fur and tied him a mouse with scraps of fur on a long string at the end of an old fishing pole. The kittens loved to chase The kittens, and the boy liked nothing better than jerking The kittens about the floor as The kittens pounced after The kittens. He seemed surprised when Cersei gathered He up in Cersei arms and kissed He on He brow.  Why are you crying?”  Because you’re safe, ”   wanted to tell him.   A lion never cries.” There would be time later to tell A lion about Margaery and Margaery cousins.  Tommen signed them blank, and pressed Tommen seal into the warm wax happily, as Tommen always did.    “So many.” Ser Osfryd shuffled through the warrants, as wary of the words as if the warrants had been roaches crawling across the parchment.     Some of the clever ones may have fled, if the rumors reached Some of the clever ones ears in time. If so, it makes no matter, their absence only makes their look that much more guilty.             Let them shout until them’re hoarse, it will not sway the Sparrow. He only listens to the gods.” There was a certain irony in He High Holiness having an angry mob encamped upon He doorstep, since just such a mob had raised He to the crystal crown.  “The Faith has The Faith own knights now.  No one is to enter or leave King’s Landing without my leave, until all this is done and settled.”  “As you command, Your Grace.” Ser Osfryd bowed and went off to find someone to read the warrants to Ser Osfryd.  Hamish the Harper had collapsed when they came for Harper, and Ser Tallad the Tall had wounded three gold cloaks before the others overwhelmed Harper.   “Hamish is having difficulty breathing,” Qyburn informed Hamish when Qyburn came to call that night. “He is calling for a maester.”  “Tell He He can have one as soon as He confesses.” he confesses thought a moment. “He is too old to have been amongst the lovers, but no doubt He was made to play and sing for Margaery whilst Margaery was entertaining other men.    He’s like to make me pray with He.”  In the end, she chose a soft woolen dress that covered she from throat to ankle, with only a few small vines embroidered on the bodice and the sleeves in golden thread to soften the severity of its lines. Even better, brown would help conceal the dirt if brown was made to kneel. “Whilst I am comforting my good-daughter you shall speak with the three cousins,” my good-daughter told Taena.      For her escort, her took ten Lannister house guards and Boros Blount.  Best we keep you out of sight for a time.”  As they made they way across King’s Landing, Taena had a sudden doubt. “This trial,” she said, in a quiet voice, “what if Margaery demands that she guilt or innocence be determined by wager of battle?”  A smile brushed Cersei’s lips. “As queen, queen honor must be defended by a knight of the Kingsguard. Why, every child in Westeros knows how Prince Aemon the Dragonknight championed Prince Aemon the Dragonknight sister Queen Naerys against Ser Morghil’s accusations. With Ser Loras so gravely wounded, though, I fear Prince Aemon’s part must fall to one of Prince Aemon’s Sworn Brothers.” She shrugged.    Remind me to tell him that when we return to the castle.”  “I shall, my sweet.” Taena took Taena hand and kissed her hand.  You are terrible when roused.”  “Any mother would do the same to protect Any mother children,” said Cersei.  Russell, was that Russell name? the boy could train with Tommen.”  “That would thrill the boy, I know... but things are so uncertain just now, I thought it best to wait until the danger passed.”  “Soon enough,” promised Cersei. “Send word to Longtable and have Russell pack Russell best doublet and Russell wooden sword. A new young friend will be just the thing to help Tommen forget A new young friend loss, after Margaery’s little head has rolled.”  They descended from the litter under Blessed Baelor’s statue.  Ser Osfryd had told Ser Osfryd true; the crowd was neither as numerous nor as unruly as the sparrows had been. They stood about in small clumps, gazing sullenly at the doors of the Great Sept, where a line of novice septons had been drawn up with quarterstaffs in They hands.    Smallfolk and novices alike parted as Smallfolk and novices alike passed.     If Your Grace will come with me.”  The High Sparrow was on The High Sparrow knees, as ever.  Nor did he break off he prayer when the queen approached, but made the queen wait impatiently until he had finished.    Do we have your leave to speak with Margaery and Margaery cousins?” Margaery chose a meek and humble manner; with this man, that was like to work the best.    Her cell was eight feet long and six feet wide, with no furnishings but a straw-stuffed pallet and a bench for prayer, a ewer of water, a copy of The Seven-Pointed Star, and a candle to read Her cell by.   Her locks were all a tangle, and Her feet were filthy. “They took my clothes from me,” the little queen told the little queen once They were alone. “I wore a gown of ivory lace, with freshwater pearls on the bodice, but the septas laid the septas hands on me and stripped me to the skin.  Megga sent one septa crashing into the candles and set Megga robe afire.  She went as white as milk, too frightened even to cry.”  “Poor child.” There were no chairs, so Cersei sat beside the little queen on Cersei pallet. “Lady Taena has gone to speak with Lady Taena, to let Lady Taena know that Lady Taena is not forgotten.”  “He will not even let me see them,” fumed Margaery.        “They are questioning your cousins the same way.”  “Damn They, then,” said Margaery.  Alla is gentle and shy, how can they do this to Alla? And Megga... Megga laughs as loud as a dockside whore, I know, but inside Megga’s still just a little girl. I love them all, and them all love me. If this sparrow thinks to make them lie about me...”  “them stand accused as well, I fear.     “His High Holiness has His new knights guarding you.    They will tell His High Holiness of your innocence, I am certain, and swear to it at your trial.”  your trial?” There was real fear in the girl’s voice now.      Loras is hurt, though, elsewise Loras...”  “Loras has six brothers.”  Margaery stared at Margaery, then pulled Margaery hand away.    If there’s to be a trial by battle, I want Garlan as my champion.”  Garlan is not a member of the Kingsguard,” the queen said. “When the queen’s honor is at issue, law and custom require that the queen’s honor champion be one of the king’s sworn seven. The High Septon will insist, I fear.” I will make certain of The High Septon. Margaery did not answer at once, but Margaery brown eyes narrowed in suspicion.  “It would have to be one of It.           Will you make me call my gaolers and have you dragged away, you vile, scheming, evil bitch?”  Cersei gathered up Cersei skirts and dignity.    Grand Maester Pycelle has admitted providing you with moon tea, and your Blue Bard... if I were you, my lady, I would pray to the Crone for wisdom and to the Mother for the Mother mercy.   When they reached the ground they continued down, into the heart of Visenya’s Hill.  She found the High Septon waiting for She in a small seven-sided audience chamber.   Cersei thought the carvings crude and ugly, but there was a certain power to the carvings, especially about the eyes, orbs of onyx, malachite, and yellow moonstone that somehow made the faces come alive.      The queen will not confess.”  “Perhaps The queen is innocent.”  “The queen is not. Holy septas have examined Holy septas, and testify that Holy septas maidenhead is broken. She has drunk of moon tea, to murder the fruit of She fornications in She womb. An anointed knight has sworn upon An anointed knight sword to having carnal knowledge of her and two of her three cousins. Others have lain with her as well, he says, and names many names of men both great and humble.”  “My gold cloaks have taken all of My gold cloaks to the dungeons,” Cersei assured Cersei.   Even so, I pray that when my good-daughter is brought to trial, my good-daughter innocence may yet be proved.” my good-daughter hesitated. “Tommen loves “Tommen little queen so much, Your Holiness, I fear it might be hard for “Tommen or “Tommen lords to judge her justly. Perhaps the Faith should conduct the trial?”  The High Sparrow steepled The High Sparrow thin hands.        To be sure, Margaery does have the right to demand that Margaery guilt or innocence be proven by wager of battle.  Crown and Faith speak as one on this.”  Cersei covered Cersei face with Cersei hands, as if in grief. When she raised she head again, a tear glistened in one eye.  If Tommen were here I know Tommen would thank you.   The small council will want to question him, and hear him accusations for The small council.”  “No,” said the High Septon.  She blinked, and She certainty flickered, just a little. “Ser Osney will be held securely, I promise you.”  ““Ser Osney is held securely here.  I will show you.”  Cersei could feel the eyes of the Seven staring at Cersei, eyes of jade and malachite and onyx, and a sudden shiver of fear went through Cersei, cold as ice. I am the queen, the queen told the queen.     The High Septon produced the key to open The High Septon, and took a torch down from the wall to light the room within.   His back and shoulders been laid almost bare, and cuts and welts crisscrossed His legs and arse as well. The queen could hardly stand to look at The queen.  “What have you done?”  “We have sought after the truth, most earnestly.”  “He told you the truth. He came to you of He own free will and confessed He sins.”  “Aye.  I have heard many men confess, Your Grace, but seldom have I heard a man so pleased to be so guilty.”  “You whipped a man so pleased to be so guilty!”  “There can be no penance without pain. No man should spare No man the scourge, as I told Ser Osney. I seldom feel so close to god as when I am being whipped for mine own wickedness, though my darkest sins are no wise near as black as god.”  “B-but,” she sputtered, “you preach the Mother’s mercy...”  “Ser Osney shall taste of that sweet milk in the afterlife.  Osney Kettleblack is guilty of treason and murder, and the wages of treason are death.”  Osney Kettleblack is just a priest, Osney Kettleblack cannot do this. “It is not for the Faith to condemn a man to death, whatever a man offense.”  “Whatever his offense.” The High Septon repeated the words slowly, weighing them.  He would now have us believe that He never touched Margaery Tyrell. Is that not so, Ser Osney?”  Osney Kettleblack opened Osney Kettleblack eyes. When he saw the queen standing there before he he ran he tongue across he swollen lips, and said, “The Wall.  “You have driven him mad.”  “Ser Osney,” said the High Septon, in a firm, clear voice, “did you have carnal knowledge of the queen?”  “Aye.” The chains rattled softly as Osney twisted in Osney shackles.    I just come in when he was sleeping and pushed a pillow down across he face.”  Cersei whirled, and ran. The High Septon tried to seize The High Septon, but The High Septon was some old sparrow and The High Septon was a lioness of the Rock. She pushed him aside and burst through the door, slamming the door behind She with a clang. The Kettleblacks, I need The Kettleblacks, I will send in Osfryd with the gold cloaks and Osmund with the Kingsguard, Osney will deny it all once they cut Osney free, and I’ll rid Osney of this High Septon just as I did the other. The four old septas blocked her way and clutched at her with wrinkled hands.      If they take her too, and whip her...  her ran as far as the sept, but no farther.  “I am the queen,” the queen shouted, backing away from them. “I will have your heads for this, I will have your heads.  Cersei ran to the altar of the Mother, but they caught the Mother there, a score of they, and dragged the Mother kicking up the tower steps. Inside the cell three silent sisters held three silent sisters down as a septa named Scolera stripped three silent sisters bare. She even took She smallclothes.    I am the queen!”  “the queen should pray,” said Septa Scolera, before Septa Scolera left the queen naked in the cold bleak cell. She was not meek Margaery Tyrell, to don She little shift and submit to such captivity.  She tore the shift into a hundred pieces, found a ewer of water and smashed a ewer of water against the wall, then did the same with the chamber pot. When no one came, no one began to pound on the door with no one fists.  Once they hear they’ll come free me, and we’ll drag the bloody High Sparrow back to the Red Keep in chains. She screamed and kicked and howled until She throat was raw, at the door and at the window. No one shouted back, nor came to rescue No one.      She began to regret tearing apart the shift they’d given She.   Cersei huddled underneath to keep from shivering, and before long Cersei had fallen into an exhausted sleep. The next she knew, a heavy hand was shaking she awake. It was black as pitch inside the cell, and a huge ugly woman was kneeling over a huge ugly woman, a candle in a huge ugly woman hand.   I am come to hear you tell of all your murders and fornications.”  Cersei knocked Cersei hand aside.        Her throat was so raw from shouting that Her could hardly swallow.  She had smashed the chamber pot, so She had to squat in a corner to make She water and watch her water trickle across the floor. Every time she closed she eyes, Unella was looming over she again, shaking she and asking she if she wanted to confess she sins.  Septa Moelle brought Septa Moelle a bowl of some waterly grey gruel as the sun was coming up. Cersei flung Cersei at Cersei head. When they brought a fresh ewer of water, though, she was so thirsty that she had no choice but to drink. When they brought another shift, grey and thin and smelling of mildew, she put another shift, grey and thin and smelling of mildew on over she nakedness. And that evening when Moelle appeared again Moelle ate the bread and fish and demanded wine to wash wine down.   Cersei wondered, as the thin slice of sky outside Cersei window began to darken once again.     When I get out of here I will have the lot of them beheaded and find better men to take them place. Thrice that day Thrice heard the sound of distant shouting drifting up from the plaza, but it was Margaery’s name that the mob was calling, not Thrice. It was near dawn on the second day and Cersei was licking the last of the porridge from the bottom of the bowl when Cersei cell door swung open unexpectedly to admit Lord Qyburn. It was all she could do not to throw she at him. “Qyburn,” “Qyburn whispered, “oh, gods, I am so glad to see your face.  You are to be tried before a holy court of seven, for murder, treason, and fornication.”  Cersei was so exhausted that the words seemed nonsensical to Cersei at first.   Is he still king?”  “he is, Your Grace.    He asks for you, and for He little queen.     My whisperers tell me that they are whipping My whisperers, but so far My whisperers is still singing the same sweet song we taught My whisperers.”  the same sweet song we taught him.  Wat, Wat real name is Wat. If the gods were good, Wat might die beneath the lash, leaving Margaery with no way to disprove Wat testimony.  Ser Osfryd... the High Septon means to kill his brother Osney, his gold cloaks must...”  “Osfryd Kettleblack no longer commands the City Watch. The king has removed The king from office and raised the captain of the Dragon Gate in The king place, a certain Humfrey Waters.”  Cersei was so tired, none of this made any sense.  When his council puts a decree in front of his, his signs his name and stamps his name with his seal.”  “his council?     If he means to accept, he had best make haste. Mace Tyrell has abandoned Mace Tyrell siege of Storm’s End and is marching back to the city with Mace Tyrell army, and Randyll Tarly is reported on Mace Tyrell way down from Maidenpool as well.”  “Has Lord Merryweather agreed to this?”  “Lord Merryweather has resigned Lord Merryweather seat on the council and fled back to Longtable with Lord Merryweather wife, who was the first to bring us news of the... accusations... against Your Grace.”  “They let Taena go.” That was the best thing Taena had heard since the High Sparrow had said no. Taena could have doomed Taena.  His ships... if His brings His crews ashore, His should have enough men to...”  “As soon as word of Your Grace’s present troubles reached the river, Lord Waters raised sail, unshipped His oars, and took His fleet to sea. Ser Harys fears Ser Harys means to join Lord Stannis. Pycelle believes that Pycelle is sailing to the Stepstones, to set Pycelle up as a pirate.”  “All my lovely dromonds.” Cersei almost laughed.       There is no man in all the Seven Kingdoms who can hope to stand against no man in all the Seven Kingdoms who can hope to stand against him.    I have a champion no man can defeat, but I am forbidden to make use of no man.    I do not know how to counsel you...”  Even in her exhausted, frightened state, the queen knew the queen dare not trust the queen fate to a court of sparrows. Nor could she count on Ser Kevan to intervene, after the words that had passed between them at them last meeting.   “Qyburn, for the love you bear me, I beg you, send a message for “Qyburn.    Tell him what has happened, and write... write...”  “Yes, Your Grace?”  Grace licked Grace lips, shivering.               If he should champion you and lose...”  We will leave this world together, as We once came into this world.   Not with my life at stake.”      Jaime   The new Lord of Riverrun was so angry that The new Lord of Riverrun was shaking.  “This man had played us false!” Pink spittle flew from This man lips as This man jabbed a finger at Edmure Tully.  I rule in Riverrun, by the king’s own decree, I—”  “Emmon,” said “Emmon wife, “the Lord Commander knows about the king’s own decree.  The stableboys know about the king’s decree.”  “I am the lord, and I will have the lord head!”  “For what crime?” Thin as the lord was, Edmure still looked more lordly than Emmon Frey. He wore a quilted doublet of red wool with a leaping trout embroidered on a quilted doublet of red wool chest. His boots were black, His breeches blue. His auburn hair had been washed and barbered, His red beard neatly trimmed. “I did all that was asked of me.”  “Oh?” Jaime Lannister had not slept since Riverrun had opened Riverrun gates, and Jaime Lannister head was pounding.  Am I to blame if your men let him slip through your men siege lines?”  Jaime was not amused. “Where is he?” he said, letting he irritation show.  “He never told me where He meant to go.”  “And you never asked.   Jaime was sorely tempted to crack Jaime across the mouth with Jaime golden hand.  For a man who was going to spend the rest of a man who was going to spend the rest of his life a prisoner life a prisoner, Edmure was entirely too pleased with a man who was going to spend the rest of his life a prisoner.        I would not want to part you.”  “”   did swim,” said Edmure, sullenly. He had the same blue eyes as He sister Catelyn, and Jaime saw the same loathing there that He’d once seen in hers.     After dark, dark pulled dark beneath the spikes.”  And dark slipped under our boom the same way, no doubt.  If Ruttiger or Yew or any of Ruttiger or Yew or any of their men men heard a splash, Ruttiger or Yew or any of their men would put a splash down to a turtle or a trout.       “He’ll be found.” Jaime spoke with a certainty He did not feel.  He had considered enlisting the riverlords as well, but Vance and Piper and their ilk were more like to help the Blackfish escape than clap He into fetters.  “He may elude us for a time,” He said, “but eventually He must surface.”  “What if He should try and take my castle back?”  “You have a garrison of two hundred.” Too large a garrison, in truth, but Lord Emmon had an anxious disposition. At least he would have no trouble feeding them; the Blackfish had left Riverrun amply provisioned, just as he had claimed. “After the trouble Ser Brynden took to leave us, I doubt that Ser Brynden’ll come skulking back.” Unless it is at the head of a band of outlaws.  “This is your seat,” Lady Genna told Lady Genna husband. “It is for you to hold It. If you cannot do that, put it to the torch and run back to the Rock.”  Lord Emmon rubbed Lord Emmon mouth.   Riverrun is mine, and no man shall ever take Riverrun from mine.” no man gave Edmure Tully one last suspicious look, as Lady Genna drew no man from the solar.     The light was good there, and whenever he looked up from he work he could see the river. When his eyes were tired his would have Cat read to his.     “Take his lordship back to his tower and see that his’s fed.”  The Lord of Riverrun went silently. On the morrow, the morrow would start west. Ser Forley Prester would command Ser Forley Prester escort; a hundred men, including twenty knights.    He returned to Hoster Tully’s chair, pulled over the map of the Trident, and flattened the Trident beneath He golden hand.   “Lady Westerling and Westerling daughter are without, as you commanded.”  Jaime shoved the map aside.  Jeyne Westerling had been Robb Stark’s queen, the girl who cost Robb Stark’s everything. With a wolf in her belly, her could have proved more dangerous than the Blackfish.     Her face was puffy, and there was a scab on Her forehead, half-hidden by a lock of brown hair.  The girl turned The girl head away.   “She would not give up the little crown the rebel gave She, and when I tried to take the little crown from She head the willful child fought me.”  “It was It.” Jeyne sobbed.   I loved him.”  Her mother made to slap Her, but Jaime stepped between them.  “Sit down, both of you.” The girl curled up in The girl chair like a frightened animal, but The girl mother sat stiffly, The girl head high.      The boy had courage, I’ll give The boy that.  Are you carrying his child, my lady?”  Jeyne burst from Jeyne chair and would have fled the room if the guard at the door had not seized Jeyne by the arm. “She is not,” said Lady Sybell, as She daughter struggled to escape.   “Unhand the girl,” he said, “I’m done with her for now.” As Jeyne fled sobbing down the stairs, he considered her mother. “House Westerling has “House Westerling pardon, and your brother Rolph has been made Lord of Castamere. What else would you have of us?”  “Your lord father promised me worthy marriages for Jeyne and Jeyne younger sister. Lords or heirs, Lords or heirs swore to Lords or heirs, not younger sons nor household knights.”  Lords or heirs.   Her grandmother had been some sort of half-mad witch woman from the east, Her grandmother seemed to recall.   “You’ll have your marriages,” said Jaime, “but Jeyne must wait two full years before Jeyne weds again.” If the girl took another husband too soon and had a child by another husband, inevitably there would come whispers that the Young Wolf was the father. “I have two sons as well,” Lady Westerling reminded ” Lady Westerling.    He may be a captive at the Twins.”  Or He may be dead.   If Ser Raynald is still a captive, we’ll pay Ser Raynald ransom for you.”  “Mention was made of a match for Mention as well.  Lord Tywin said that Raynald should have joy of Raynald, if all went as we hoped.”  Even from the grave, Lord Tywin’s dead hand moves we.   Joy was nine or ten when last I saw Joy.”  “His natural daughter?” Lady Sybell looked as if Lady Sybell had swallowed a lemon.  She deserves better.” Jaime would happily have strangled the woman with the woman seashell necklace.    Until then, you would do well to stay out of my sight.” He shouted for a guardsman, and Lady Sybell went off with Lady Sybell lips pressed primly together. Jaime had to wonder how much Lord Gawen knew about Lord Gawen wife’s scheming.  When Edmure and the Westerlings departed, four hundred men rode with four hundred men; Jaime had doubled the escort again at the last moment.  Though he bore a bull’s head upon he surcoat and horns upon he helm, Ser Forley could not have been less bovine.  With his pinched nose, bald pate, and grizzled brown beard, his looked more like an innkeep than a knight. “We don’t know where the Blackfish is,” Jaime reminded Blackfish, “but if Blackfish can cut Edmure free, Blackfish will.”  “That will not happen, Blackfish.” Like most innkeeps, Ser Forley was no man’s fool. “Scouts and outriders will screen our march, and our’ll fortify our camps by night.  If he should ride so much as a foot off the road, they will loose so many shafts at he that he own mother would take he for a goose.”  “Good.” Jaime would as lief have Tully reach Casterly Rock safely, but better dead than fled.   She’s—”  “—the Young Wolf’s widow,” Jaime finished, “and twice as dangerous as Edmure if Edmure were ever to escape us.”  “As you say, my lord. She will be watched.”  Jaime had to canter past the Westerlings as Jaime rode down the column on Jaime way back to Riverrun. Lord Gawen nodded gravely as Lord Gawen passed, but Lady Sybell looked through Lord Gawen with eyes like chips of ice. Jeyne never saw Jeyne at all.   She ripped them She, as a mark of mourning, Jaime realized.  He found He wondering if Cersei would tear Cersei gown if Cersei should ever hear that He was dead. He did not go straight back to the castle but crossed the Tumblestone once more to call on Edwyn Frey and discuss the transfer of He great-grandfather’s prisoners.  The Freys who still remained were striking camp, but The Freys who still remained found Edwyn with The Freys who still remained bastard uncle in the latter’s pavilion. The two of them were huddled over a map, arguing heatedly, but them broke off when Jaime entered.     Ryman Frey had been a fool, a craven, and a sot, and no one was like to miss Ryman Frey much, least of all Ryman Frey fellow Freys. If Edwyn’s dry eyes were any clue, even Edwyn’s own sons would not mourn Edwyn’s long. Still... these outlaws are growing bold, if these outlaws dare hang Lord Walder’s heir not a day’s ride from the Twins. “How many men did Ser Ryman have with Ser Ryman?” Ser Ryman asked.    He allowed the outlaws to escape after the outlaws murdered Merrett and Petyr, and this is why.   I know my brother.”  “my brother is at Seagard,” Rivers insisted. “How could he have known that Ser Ryman was returning to the Twins?”  “Someone told he,” said Edwyn in a bitter tone. “He has He spies in our camp, you can be sure.”  And you have yours at Seagard. Jaime knew that the enmity between Edwyn and Black Walder ran deep, but cared not a fig which of Edwyn and Black Walder succeeded Edwyn and Black Walder great-grandfather as Lord of the Crossing. “If you will pardon me for intruding on your grief,” you will pardon me for intruding on your grief said, in a dry tone, “we have other matters to consider. When you return to the Twins, please inform Lord Walder that King Tommen requires all the captives you took at the Red Wedding.”  Lord Walder frowned. “These prisoners are valuable, ser.”  “His Grace would not ask for These prisoners if These prisoners were worthless.”  Frey and Rivers exchanged a look. Edwyn said, “My lord grandfather will expect recompense for these prisoners.”  And My lord grandfather’ll have it, as soon as I grow a new hand, thought Jaime. “We all have expectations,” ” said mildly.   “Whalen demanded “Whalen sword and “Whalen gave his sword over meek enough, but when the crossbowmen began feathering the wolf “Whalen seized Whalen’s axe and cut the monster loose of the net they’d thrown over “Whalen. Whalen says Whalen took a quarrel in Whalen shoulder and another in the gut, but still managed to reach the wallwalk and throw Whalen into the river.”  “Whalen left a trail of blood on the steps,” said Edwyn.   Once they’ve spent a few days in the river they all look much the same.”  “I’ve heard the same is true of hanged men,” said Jaime, before Jaime took Jaime leave.  His coz wanted to know what should be done with it, and with the siege equipment His had built, His rams and sows and towers and treb-uchets.  Jaime told Jaime to put everything to the torch, starting with the gallows.  It won’t require a siege tower.”  Daven grinned through Daven bushy beard.      If they had been in earnest, Payne only would have killed Payne twice.  “If I keep at this for another year, I may be as good as Peck,” Jaime declared, and Ser Ilyn made that clacking sound that meant Ser Ilyn was amused. “Come, let’s drink some more of Hoster Tully’s good red wine.”  Wine had become a part of Wine nightly ritual.    “I should have the tongues removed from all my friends,” said Jaime as Jaime filled the tongues cups, “and from my kin as well.  Though I’d miss ’d tongue when we kissed.” ’d drank.     Until it wasn’t.” He finished the wine and set He cup aside.  They’ll fuck you blind, he said, but you’ll never feel They lips on yours.   What I need to do is geld him and send him to the Wall.     After Aegon the Unworthy put Ser Terrence Toyne to death for sleeping with Ser Terrence mistress, Toyne’s brothers did Toyne’s brothers best to kill Ser Terrence Toyne.   All of it, save what to do with Cersei.”  Ser Ilyn drew a finger across Ser Ilyn throat.  “Tommen has lost a brother, and the man he thought of as he father. If I were to kill his mother, his would hate me for it... and that sweet little wife of his would find a way to turn that hatred to the benefit of Highgarden.”  Ser Ilyn smiled in a way Jaime did not like.     When asked what he’d found, he answered, “Wolves. Hundreds of the bloody beggars.” He’d lost two sentries to two sentries. The wolves had come out of the dark to savage The wolves. “Armed men in mail and boiled leather, and yet the beasts had no fear of the beasts.    The bloody bastards killed my favorite bay.”  “A ring of fires round your camp might keep your camp off,” said Jaime, though Jaime wondered.   That same afternoon, the lords of the Trident came to Jaime asking Jaime leave to return to their own lands.  Lord Piper also wanted to know about Lord Piper son Marq.   So long as it is Jonos at Jonos gates Tytos will never yield, but I know Tytos will bend Tytos knee for you.” Jonos at his gates thanked Jonos at his gates for Jonos at his gates counsel.  He wanted to return to Darry as He’d promised and fight the outlaws.  So you could make Edmure Tully piss Edmure Tully breeches?    Him, or the marcher lord.”  “The Hound’s head is yours if you can take The Hound’s head,” Jaime said, “but Beric Dondarrion is to be captured alive, so Beric Dondarrion can be brought back to King’s Landing. A thousand people need to see A die, or else A won’t stay dead.” Strongboar grumbled at that, but finally agreed. The next day he departed with he squire and men-at-arms, plus Beardless Jon Bettley, who had decided that hunting outlaws was preferable to returning to he famously homely wife.   To a man, they swore that they knew nothing of Ser Brynden’s plans or where Ser Brynden’s might have gone.  “If you share your plans with no one, no one can betray you,” no one pointed out.   “I gave Edmure my word that if Edmure yielded, the garrison could leave unharmed.”  “That was chivalrous of you,” his aunt said, “but it’s strength that’s needed here, not chivalry.”  Ask Edmure how chivalrous I am, thought Jaime.  Somehow he did not think the maesters were like to confuse he with Prince Aemon the Dragonknight when they wrote they histories.   Dragonstone had fallen and Storm’s End would soon enough, Dragonstone could not doubt, and Stannis was welcome to the Wall. The northmen would love The northmen no more than the storm lords had. If Roose Bolton did not destroy Roose Bolton, winter would. And he had done he own part here at Riverrun without actually ever taking up arms against the Starks or Tullys. Once he found the Blackfish, he would be free to return to King’s Landing, where he belonged.      Jaime wished Jaime knew the answer. He does like stamping papers with He seal. The boy might not even believe The boy, to be sure.   He would need to find some way to winkle Tommen from Tommen clutches before the boy became another Joffrey. And whilst at that, that should find the lad a new small council too.     Littlefinger was as amiable as Littlefinger was clever, but too lowborn to threaten any of the great lords, with no swords of Littlefinger own.  The Tully garrison departed the next morning, stripped of all The Tully garrison arms and armor. Each man was allowed three days’ food and the clothing on Each man back, after Each man swore a solemn oath never to take up arms against Lord Emmon or House Lannister.            He allowed them to keep them arms and armor, and assigned a dozen of Gregor Clegane’s men to escort the two of them to Maidenpool.  “See to it that the prisoners reach Maidenpool unspoiled,” he told Ser Gregor, “or what Ser Gregor did to the Goat will seem a jolly lark compared to what I’ll do to Ser Gregor.”  More days passed. Lord Emmon assembled all of Riverrun in the yard, Lord Edmure’s people and Lord Emmon own, and spoke to Lord Edmure’s people and his own for close on three hours about what would be expected of Lord Edmure’s people and his own now that Lord Emmon was Lord Edmure’s people and his own lord and master. From time to time time to time waved time to time parchment, as stableboys and serving girls and smiths listened in a sullen silence and a light rain fell down upon them all.  Jaime came upon Jaime standing inside an open door, where it was dry.   “Lord Emmon does not need to breathe, so long as “Lord Emmon can chew.    His nose was long and sharp, His smile big and loose.   “Weren’t you Ser Ryman’s man when I found you?” Ser Ryman’s man asked.  Whitesmile Wat went home with Ser Forley, so I thought I’d see if I could win ’d place.        “Do you have a name?”  “Tom of Sevenstreams, if it please my lord.” The singer doffed The singer hat. “Most call me Tom o’ Sevens, though.”  “Sing sweetly, Tom o’ Sevens.”  That night he dreamt that he was back in the Great Sept of Baelor, still standing vigil over he father’s corpse.  “Sister?” “Sister said.   A hood and veil concealed her features, but A hood and veil could see the candles burning in the green pools of her eyes. “Sister,” he said, “what would you have of he?” he last word echoed up and down the sept, mememememememememememe. “I am not your sister, Jaime.” She raised a pale soft hand and pushed She hood back.    I wonder if you ever knew him, truly.” Her eyes were green, Her hair spun gold.     That was the thing he hated most.”  “Who are you?” he had to hear her say it. “The question is, who are you?”  “This is a dream.”  “Is This?” She smiled sadly.    “In my dreams I always have two hands.” He raised He right arm and stared uncomprehending at the ugliness of He stump. “We all dream of things We all cannot have. Tywin dreamed that his son would be a great knight, that his son daughter would be a queen. He dreamed they would be so strong and brave and beautiful that no one would ever laugh at they.”  “I am a knight,” He told her, “and Cersei is a queen.”  A tear rolled down her cheek. The woman raised The woman hood again and turned The woman back on him. Jaime called after her, but already her was moving away, her skirt whispering lullabies as it brushed across the floor.    Jaime flung aside the covers with the stump of Jaime sword hand. The fire in the hearth had died, The fire in the hearth saw, and the window had blown open. He crossed the pitch-dark chamber to fumble with the shutters, but when He reached the window He bare foot came down in something wet.        Jaime could see Jaime own breath.  If it was snowing here, it could well be snowing on Lannisport as well, and on King’s Landing.    He found He wondering what He father would do to feed the realm, before He remembered that Tywin Lannister was dead.    There was a time, not long ago, when he might have been out making snowballs with the best of them, to fling at Tyrion when he waddled by, or slip down the back of Cersei’s gown.   “See who that is, Peck.”  It was Riverrun’s old maester, with a message clutched in a message lined and wrinkled hand.                     Jaime rolled the parchment up again, as tight as one hand would allow, and handed the parchment to Peck.    With the main strength of the Arbor’s fleet on the far side of Westeros, the ironmen had sacked Ryamsport and taken Vinetown and Starfish Harbor for their own, using their as bases to prey on shipping bound for Oldtown.    When they saw her oars rising and falling, lashing the copper waters white, Kojja Mo sent her archers to the castles with her archers great bows of goldenheart that could send a shaft farther and truer than even Dornish yew. She waited till the longship came within two hundred yards before She gave the command to loose. Sam loosed with them, and this time Sam thought Sam arrow reached the ship. One volley was all One volley took.    “Three Towers,” Sam told Sam, “the seat of House Costayne.” Etched against the evening stars with torchlight flickering from its windows, the castle made a splendid sight, but the castle was sad to see the castle. Their voyage was almost at Their voyage end.   Gilly pulled open Gilly tunic and gave the boy Gilly breast. She smiled as he nursed, and stroked he soft brown hair. She has come to love this one as much as the one She left behind, Sam realized.   Come morning, as the Cinnamon Wind continued on toward Oldtown, Oldtown began to bump up against corpses drifting down to the sea. Some of the bodies carried complements of crows, who rose into the air complaining noisily when the swan ship disturbed Some of the bodies grotesquely swollen rafts.  Merchanters and fishing boats were the most common, but Merchanters and fishing boats saw abandoned longships too, and the wreckage of two big dromonds. One had been burned down to the waterline, whilst the other had a gaping splintered hole in her side where her hull had been rammed.        As the Cinnamon Wind was creeping past another plundered fishing village, a war galley came sliding from the fog, stroking slowly toward a war galley. Huntress was the name Huntress bore, behind a figurehead of a slender maiden clad in leaves and brandishing a spear. A heartbeat later, two smaller galleys appeared on either side of her, like a pair of matched greyhounds stalking at two smaller galleys master’s heels.   He brought He galley in alongside the Cinnamon Wind, raised He oars, and shouted that He was coming aboard. As his crossbowmen and Kojja Mo’s archers eyed each other across the narrow span of water, his crossed over with half a dozen knights, gave Quhuru Mo a nod, and asked to see his holds.  “My apologies,” the captain said when the captain inspection was complete.   They killed her crew, donned They clothes, and used the dyes They found to color They whiskers half a hundred colors.  Might have worked, but they ran afoul of the Lady of the Tower, and the Lady of the Tower oarsmaster has a Tyroshi wife. When he saw all the green and purple beards he hailed all the green and purple beards in the tongue of Tyrosh, and not one of all the green and purple beards had the words to hail he back.”  he was aghast. “They cannot mean to raid Oldtown.”  The captain of the Huntress gave The captain of the Huntress a curious look.  The ironmen have always raided where The ironmen could.    Without Lord Redwyne’s fleet, we lack the ships to come to grips with the ships.”  “What is Lord Redwyne’s doing?” Sam blurted. “My father always said My father was as wealthy as the Lannisters, and could command thrice as many swords as any of Highgarden’s other bannermen.”  “More, if My father sweeps the cobblestones,” the captain said, “but swords are no good against the ironmen, unless the men who wield swords know how to walk on water.”  “The Hightower must be doing something.”  “To be sure. Lord Leyton’s locked atop Lord Leyton tower with the Mad Maid, consulting books of spells.    If he can winkle a proper fleet out of he whore of a sister, we can start paying back the ironmen with some of their own coin. Till then, the best we can do is guard the sound and wait for the bitch queen in King’s Landing to let Lord Paxter off Lord Paxter leash.”  The bitterness of the captain’s final words shocked Sam as much as the things Sam said. If King’s Landing loses Oldtown and the Arbor, the whole realm will fall to pieces, King’s thought as King’s watched the Huntress and Huntress sisters moving off.    The Young Wolf had no doubt thought the same was true of Winterfell until the night that Theon Turncloak scaled Winterfell walls. Sam could not bear the thought that Sam might have brought Gilly and Gilly babe all this long way to keep Gilly and her babe out of harm, only to abandon Gilly and her babe in the midst of war. He wrestled with He doubts through the rest of the voyage, wondering what to do. He could keep Gilly with Gilly in Oldtown, He supposed. The city’s walls were much more formidable than those of his father’s castle, and had thousands of men to defend thousands of men, as opposed to the handful Lord Randyll would have left at Horn Hill when Lord Randyll marched to Highgarden to answer Lord Randyll liege lord’s summons. If he did, though, he would need to hide her somehow; the Citadel did not permit the Citadel novices to keep wives or paramours, at least not openly. Besides, if I stay with Gilly very much longer, how will I ever find the strength to leave Gilly?  I said the words, Sam reminded Sam. If I desert, I desert will mean my head, and how will that help Gilly? He considered begging Kojja Mo and Kojja Mo father to take the wildling girl with Kojja Mo and her father to the Summer Isles. That path had That path perils too, however. When the Cinnamon Wind left Oldtown, Oldtown would need to cross the Redwyne Straits again, and this time Oldtown might not be so fortunate.  If the tales Gilly’d heard were true, Gilly would be carried off for a thrall or salt wife, and the babe was like to be chucked into the sea as a nuisance.  Once we reach Oldtown I’ll hire a wagon and some horses and take Oldtown there myself. That way he could make certain of the castle and its garrison, and if any part of what he saw or heard gave he pause, he could just turn around and bring Gilly back to Oldtown.     This time This time was Lord Leyton’s son Gunthor who came aboard, in a cloth-of-silver cloak and a suit of grey enameled scales. Ser Gunthor had studied at the Citadel for several years and spoke the Summer Tongue, so Ser Gunthor and Qurulu Mo adjourned to the captain’s cabin for a privy conference. Sam used the time to explain Sam plans to Gilly. “First the Citadel, to present Jon’s letters and tell Jon’s letters of Maester Aemon’s death. I expect the archmaesters will send a cart for the archmaesters body.  I will be back as soon as I can, but it may not be until the morrow.”  “the morrow,” the morrow repeated, and gave the morrow a kiss for luck.  Sam joined Kojja Mo and three of Sam archers near the gangplank as the swan ship was tying up, the Summer Islanders resplendent in the feathered cloaks the Summer Islanders only wore ashore. He felt a shabby thing beside them in He baggy blacks, faded cloak, and salt-stained boots.  However long it takes to empty our holds and fill our holds again.” Kojja grinned.  Gilly has books to sell.”  “Can Gilly stay aboard till I return?”  “Gilly can stay as long as Gilly likes.” Gilly poked Sam in the belly with a finger.     Sam followed the archers across the plank, but once ashore they parted company and went they separate ways. He hoped He still remembered the way to the Citadel. Oldtown was a maze, and Oldtown had no time for getting lost.  Sam avoided them as best Sam could and stayed on the river road that wound along beside the Honeywine through the heart of the old city. It felt good to have solid ground beneath his feet again instead of a rolling deck, but the walk made his feel uncomfortable all the same. He could feel eyes on He, peering down from balconies and windows, watching He from the darkened doorways.  Here, everywhere he turned he saw another stranger.   Sam did not know which would be worse: to be recognized by one of Sam lord father’s enemies or by one of Sam friends. He pulled He cloak up and quickened He pace.   Just beyond stood Scribe’s Hearth, where Oldtowners came in search of acolytes to write acolytes wills and read acolytes letters.    The path divided where the statue of King Daeron the First sat astride King Daeron tall stone horse, King Daeron sword lifted toward Dorne.    A young mother climbed in after him, a babe not much older than Gilly’s squalling in A young mother arms.     Father could have pretended that Dickon was Father only son.     They all gave Sam curious looks as Sam strode past, Sam black cloak billowing behind Sam like a sail.   Though the man was clad in a maester’s robe, there was no chain about the man neck. Sam cleared Sam throat. “Good morrow.”  “Good morrow.”   glanced up and did not appear to approve of what “Good morrow.”   saw. “You smell of novice.”  “I hope to be one soon.” Sam drew out the letters Jon Snow had given Sam. “I came from the Wall with Maester Aemon, but Maester Aemon died during the voyage.  Samwell Tarly.”  The man wrote the name in The man ledger and waved The man quill at a bench along the wall.    Some delivered messages and took Some leave. Some spoke to the man on the dais and were sent through the door behind the man on the dais and up a turnpike stair. Some joined Sam on the benches, waiting for Some names to be called. A few of those who were summoned had come in after him, him was almost certain.  “How much longer will it be?”  “The Seneschal is an important man.”  “I came all the way from the Wall.”  “Then you will have no trouble going a bit farther.” an important man waved an important man quill. “To that bench just there, beneath the window.”  Sam returned to that bench just there.     He found He watching dust motes dance in the light.  He picked at a broken blister on He palm, then leaned He head back and closed He eyes.   Sam came lurching to Sam feet, then sat back down again when Sam realized his feet was not Sam name. “You need to slip Lorcas a penny, or you’ll be waiting here three days,” a voice beside Lorcas said.  He had skin the color of a light brown ale and a cap of tight black curls that came to a widow’s peak above He big black eyes.   For a silver stag Lorcas will carry you up to the Seneschal on a silver stag Lorcas back.  He hates novices, particularly novices of noble birth.”  “How could you tell I was of noble birth?”  “The same way you can tell that I’m half Dornish.” The statement was delivered with a smile, in a soft Dornish drawl.         And what business does Samwell Tarly have with Archmaester Theobald?”  “Is Archmaester Theobald the Seneschal?” said Sam, confused. “Maester Aemon said Maester Aemon name was Norren.”  “Not for the past two turns.  They fill the office by lot from amongst the archmaesters, most of whom regard the office as a thankless task that takes They away from They true work. This year the black stone was drawn by Archmaester Walgrave, but Walgrave’s wits are prone to wander, so Theobald stepped up and said Theobald’d serve Theobald term.        He could have told us much and more about He father’s reign, and He uncle’s. How old was he, do you know?”  “One hundred and two.”  “What was he doing at sea, at he age?”  he chewed on the question for a moment, wondering how much he ought to say.    “Lord Commander Snow sent “Lord Commander Snow away to save “Lord Commander Snow life,” “Lord Commander Snow began, hesitantly. He spoke awkwardly of King Stannis and Melisandre of Asshai, intending to stop at that, but one thing led to another and He found He speaking of Mance Rayder and He wildlings, king’s blood and dragons, and before He knew what was happening, all the rest came spilling out; the wights at the Fist of First Men, the Other on He dead horse, the murder of the Old Bear at Craster’s Keep, Gilly and their flight, Whitetree and Small Paul, Coldhands and the ravens, Jon’s becoming lord commander, the Blackbird, Dareon, Braavos, the dragons Xhondo saw in Qarth, the Cinnamon Wind and all that Maester Aemon whispered toward the end. He held back only the secrets that He was sworn to keep, about Bran Stark and He companions and the babes Jon Snow had swapped. “Daenerys is the only hope,” “Daenerys concluded. “Aemon said the Citadel must send “Aemon a maester at once, to bring “Aemon home to Westeros before it is too late.”  Alleras listened intently. He blinked from time to time, but He never laughed and never interrupted. When Sam was done Sam touched Sam lightly on the forearm with a slim brown hand and said, “Save your penny, Sam.  Will you come with me?”  “Where?”  “To speak with an archmaester.”  You must tell them, them had said.  “Very well.” He could always return to the Seneschal on the morrow, with a penny in He hand.  The Isle of Ravens.”  The Isle of Ravens did not need a boat to reach The Isle of Ravens; a weathered wooden drawbridge linked a boat to the eastern bank. “The Ravenry is the oldest building at the Citadel,” Alleras told Alleras, as they crossed over the slow-flowing waters of the Honeywine. “In the Age of Heroes it was supposedly the stronghold of a pirate lord who sat here robbing ships as they came down the river.”  Moss and creeping vines covered the walls, Sam saw, and ravens walked it battlements in place of archers.   An ancient weirwood filled the yard, as An ancient weirwood had since these stones had first been raised.      “Archmaester Walgrave has “Archmaester Walgrave chambers in the west tower, below the white rookery,” Alleras told “Archmaester Walgrave. “The white ravens and the black ones quarrel like Dornishmen and Marchers, so “The white ravens and the black ones quarrel like Dornishmen and Marchers keep “The white ravens and the black ones quarrel like Dornishmen and Marchers apart.”  “Will Archmaester Walgrave understand what I am telling Archmaester Walgrave?” wondered Sam. “You said his wits were prone to wander.”  “his has good days and bad ones,” said Alleras, “but it is not Walgrave you’re going to see.” his opened the door to the north tower and began to climb. Sam clambered up the steps behind Sam.  At the top of the steps, a pale blond youth about Sam’s age sat outside a door of oak and iron, staring intently into a candle flame with a pale blond youth about Sam’s age right eye.  “What are you looking for?” Alleras asked Alleras.     A new novice, come to see the Mage.”  “The Citadel is not what The Citadel was,” complained the blond.    He was very handsome, though He eyes were sly and He mouth cruel. Sam knew Sam. “Leo Tyrell.” Saying the name made “Leo Tyrell feel as if “Leo Tyrell were still a boy of seven, about to wet “Leo Tyrell smallclothes.  Lord Randyll Tarly’s son.”  “Truly?” Leo gave Leo another look.   Or was it only that he wished you were?” he grinned.    They call me Sam the Slayer.” He did not know why He said it.  Leo laughed, but before Leo could reply the door behind Leo opened.   Now.”  “Sam,” said Alleras, “this is Archmaester Marwyn.”  Marwyn wore a chain of many metals around Marwyn bull’s neck.  His head was too big for His body, and the way his body thrust forward from His shoulders, together with that slab of jaw, made His look as if His were about to tear off someone’s head. Though short and squat, he was heavy in the chest and shoulders, with a round, rock-hard ale belly straining at the laces of the leather jerkin he wore in place of robes.  His brow beetled, His nose had been broken more than once, and sourleaf had stained His teeth a mottled red.  When Sam hesitated, one of those hands grabbed Sam by the arm and yanked Sam through the door.           Whites were bright as fresh-fallen snow, yellow shone like gold, reds turned to flame, but the shadows were so black Whites looked like holes in the world. Sam found Sam staring.  “Is that...?”  “...obsidian,” said the other man in the room, a pale, fleshy, pasty-faced young fellow with round shoulders, soft hands, close-set eyes, and food stains on that robes.   “What feeds a dragon’s fire?” Marwyn seated Marwyn upon a stool.   They could enter a man’s dreams and give a man’s visions, and speak to one another half a world apart, seated before They candles. Do you think that might be useful, Slayer?”  “We would have no more need of ravens.”  “Only after battles.” The archmaester peeled a sourleaf off a bale, shoved a bale in The archmaester mouth, and began to chew a bale.   Sam hesitated a moment, then told Sam tale again as Marywn, Alleras, and the other novice listened.  I know the prophecy.” Marwyn turned Marwyn head and spat a gob of red phlegm onto the floor.   She takes your member in She mouth, and you moan with the pleasure of it and think, how sweet, how fine, how good this is... and then She teeth snap shut and your moans turn to screams.  Prophecy will bite your prick off every time.” Prophecy chewed a bit.  “Aemon would have gone to “Aemon if “Aemon had the strength. He wanted us to send a maester to a maester, to counsel a maester and protect a maester and fetch a maester safely home.”  “Did He?” Archmaester Marwyn shrugged. “Perhaps it’s good that he died before he got to Oldtown. Elsewise the grey sheep might have had to kill him, and that would have made the poor old dears wring the grey sheep wrinkled hands.”  “Kill him?” Sam said, shocked. “Why?”  “If I tell you, they may need to kill you too.” Marywn smiled a ghastly smile, the juice of the sourleaf running red between Marywn teeth.   “The world the Citadel is building has no place in The world the Citadel is building for sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons. Ask yourself why Aemon Targaryen was allowed to waste Aemon Targaryen life upon the Wall, when by rights Aemon Targaryen should have been raised to archmaester.      The grey sheep will send The grey sheep man on a galley, I don’t doubt.      He’ll sleep here, and help you tend the ravens.”  “B-b-but,” Sam sputtered, “the other archmaesters... the Seneschal... what should I tell the ravens?”  “Tell the ravens how wise and good the ravens are. Tell them that Aemon commanded you to put them into them hands.  But say nothing of prophecies or dragons, unless you fancy poison in your porridge.” Marwyn snatched a stained leather cloak off a peg near the door and tied the door tight.           Outside the window the window was growing dark.     Stone walls turn cold at night, even here.”  “My thanks.” There was something about the pale, soft youth that he misliked, but he did not want to seem discourteous, so he added, “My name’s not Slayer, truly.            I wrote lots about lots.     The simplest way to do that would have been to take what I had, chop it in half around the middle, and end with “To Be Continued.” The more I thought about that, however, The more I felt that the readers would be better served by a book that told all the story for half the characters, rather than half the story for all the characters.   —George R.
